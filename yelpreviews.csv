Place,Reviews,Sentiment
gardens-by-the-bay,went with my girlfriend to gardens by the bay and we managed to clock in   steps gigantic garden with lots of wonderful attractions my girlfriend loves flower dome but i would prefer the cloud forest floral fantasy was kind of in the middle for both of us foods though are quite limited in selection we went to marina square to have our dinner instead,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,review is solely for the gardens an iconic landmark of singapore the gardens by the bay combine culture architecture and ingenuity that impressively represent the city state of singapore located in the heart of the city there are several areas within the garden that you can go see there are also several towers that are distinct from one another fortunately my friend from singapore had a few free passes that allowed us to go up  of the towers the fee is not exorbitant and relatively cheap there are several tours that are offered but literally everything is written in english so there is not a big problem with learning on your own every evening there is a light show for the gardens by the bay that is definitely worth watching you can see the light show from the famous marina bay sands hotel balcony either paying  for a cover charge or simply buying a drink there is a lot to explore but my favorite part of the garden was what a call the bio dome of plants essentially within a controlled sheltered environment nearly flora represented from every country was flourishing further on the hot day the bio dome was actually cold the engineering of the bio dome allows for cool air not manufactured by some giant a c pretty darn green friendly this is destination is a must but be prepared it gets hot in the day there are so many places to take a date here as well oh if only nice,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is nice to see it by day to see the structure and how it is assembled if you want to see the full beauty of it see it at night it is much cooler and more rewarding to see it lighted up it is still nice to walk and meander around the area during the day and you must go up to the cloud by the forest nearby if you are already here anyways the cloud forest was mostly why i made the jaunt to the gardens it is cool to see the gardens by the bay floral homage up close too it is a nice stepping stone to see other great things,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,expect to be mesmerized by this enchanting garden leaving u full of ooooooohhhhs and aaaaahhhhhhhs lights come alive daily at    p look for the area with the most number of trees relatively close to each other for the best views singaporeans do not mess around when it comes to time so be on time i do not remember exactly how long each show lasted but it was a good   minutes of jaw dropping magnificence best yet this show costs zero zippo nada dollars that is all there is to know now go get wowed well after we kick the shit out of covid,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,wow all i can say is wow this place is amazing it is ginormous with lots of different sections to visit entry to the garden is free but it does cost extra to go up to the super tree observatories or greenhouses the place is clean and well maintained great place for romantic strolls family excursions morning jogs you name it at night gardens by the bay is transformed to a beautiful wonderland the dragonfly bridge is gorgeous and overlooks a small pond that is filled with giant colorful rubber beach balls at night it makes for such a romantic walk the supertree grove is where you definitely have to be in the evening every night there is a light show complete with orchestral music the lights glitter with the rhythm of the music and the sound system is incredible practically everyone has their heads craned upwards completely enthralled a must go for anyone visiting singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,unfortunately we did not get to see the supertrees skyway due to the rain the last two days we went here they closed the ocbc skyway observatory deck due to safety reasons i mean that is good but bad timing for us our ticket lasts  months so we will see if we come back or give it away there are no refund if we miss the opportunity to go it is unfortunate the trees were beautiful decorated with plants and flowers especially during their light show at pm you have to stay close by the area to reserve a seat to see this an hour before the light show we saw this afar and it was beautiful none the less hopefully you do not come here during the rainy season and miss this like us it would be well worth the advance purchase at least we got to see the cloud and flower domes since it is covered,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,we came to check out gardens by the bay on a wednesday afternoon and it was not busy at all i do not know if the coronavirus was to blame or maybe because it was a weekday but it made it nice and easy for us to go through the exhibits we walked through the supertree grove first to get to the skyway it was a great view of the city but probably not recommended for those scared of heights it was a windy day also so it was a little bit scary for me on the narrower sides of the skyway i have seen photos of the supertree grove at night and i think that would be a diffferent experience but equally as magnificent as in the daytime it is a pretty short bridge but i think it is fairly priced at  sgd per person because of the amazing views we went through the cloud forest after to get out of the warm sun it had such beautiful architecture and vegetation inside it seems small at first but there are so many different levels and areas to walk through there were several other attractions here but those were the only two we had time to visit if you can carve out a full morning or afternoon i would definitely recommend it they have package deals for tickets so you can visit multiple attractions with a discounted rate as well,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,you have to visit gardens by the bay there is really something for everyone to see here not only is it a beautiful place but it is full of culture and history here you will see plants from around the world and they tell a story they display plants and tell where they are from and the timeframes of when they originated there are also sculptures of animals from around the world and other general sculptures for kids they have a play area with water to cool down so much to see and you will learn something new along the way i ran into people from around the world here and even some that i went to college with in arizona united states,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is every bit as cool as i was led to believe by multiple sources we skipped the ticketed sections as we were short on time but still enjoyed walking through the free public spaces getting around the park is easy with the helpful maps and there are plenty of concessions if you are feeling hungry or thirsty i had a delicious iced mocha from the coffee spot last but not least there is a taxi queue for when you are ready to move along i would love to spend more time here and check out some of the ticketed areas on a future singapore visit,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a gorgeous new addition to singapore is waterfront that played a role in crazy rich asians some sites like the two conservatories flower dome cloud forest and the overhead skyway connecting the supertrees charge admission but for most it is a pleasant totally free experience whether a nice walk around beautifully landscaped and well tended grounds admiring the supertrees from down below or having fun with the kids at the children is garden and water fountain there is lots for everyone to do there are even two nightly light and music shows at the supertrees it is all so pretty and stunning in fact that you would almost be excused for looking up at everything instead of keeping track of the footpath in front of you or of others all around stay alert and there should be plenty of room for all,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is a must visit attraction plan to spend the whole day here and be prepared for a lot of walking the park is pretty no matter what time of the day you visit however it gets really beautiful once it gets dark and everything is lit up the park itself is free and you can walk around an enjoy quite a bit here without purchasing any ticket however i would recommend doing a couple of attractions like cloud forest flower dome or the skywalk you will need to purchase tickets for each of those you get a beautiful view of the whole city and the various attractions like marina bay sands singapore flyer and merlion from various parts of the park and do stay for the light show in the evening you will be dead tired at the end of the day but it is well worth the time spent here,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i was so thrilled to be back in singapore with my husband gardens was on top of our must see list and it was just as spectacular as i remembered it highlight was floral fantasy it was not open when i came in  so i was beyond excited because i love flowers i have to say it was breathtaking i think i had my mouth open walking through the garden the amount of work put in each hanging flower ball is insane hubby liked the cloud forest more the waterfall was incredible and he liked the rainforest feel inside the dome def a destination you must not miss when in sin,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is one of the must visit attractions when visiting singapore the gardens are pretty big so there is plenty to walk around and see the best part is that most of the park is free you can choose to pay to go into the different special exhibitions and even do a skywalk on the top of the super trees if you are planning to do this it is cheaper to buy a package ticket for a few of the attractions the grounds have everything you could need there is a shuttle service that will take you around to the different areas there are plenty of bathrooms and even  different food courts for eating when visiting definitely plan to spend an entire day here the grounds are beautiful and i definitely recommend paying extra for the tickets to see the cloud forest and flower dome you should then end the day by sticking around for the light show at night which is also free grab some food at the nearby food court and pick a spot on the lawn to take in the show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this was a fun activity for our trip we ate at the seafood restaurant followed by the combo pass for the flower dome and waterfall dome then walked around the garden a bit i highly recommend walking from the garden to the marina sands hotel the bridge across has a wonderful view of the iconic hotel skywheel and garden this is a free and awesome part my favorite dome was the waterfall it was really engaging rare flowers extinct in the wild carvings and even lego art mixed in some educational videos as well flower walls for instagram photo opts galore wear a bright dress i would recommend read that has plenty of movement to twirl around and get your instagram content the seafood restaurant portions are to share the prices looked really high but when split between   they are more reasonable,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is one of the two must visit attractions while you are in singapore especially if you are into nature it is separate as one is a flower dome while the other is a cloud forest you can see the skyline of singapore and of the bay it was decorated with christmas displays which made it more lovely again it is must if you are in singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a must visit the outdoor park is free itself but you have to pay to visit in the indoor gardens the cloud dome was our favourite with the indoor waterfall it was also a great spot to cool off from the brutal humidity the park features are incredible and very photo worthy especially the super trees and the cool egg floaties in the water with view of the marina bay sands in the background,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,you would be a fool to miss this especially at night when the light show is happening the floral exhibits are ado worth seeing but either come early or late because it tends to be overcrowded,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,literally everyone is must visit hot spot when in singapore gardens by the bay is a giant park behind marina bay sands with no admission fee i went around pm and waited until  pm to watch the light show garden rhapsody soooo beautiful it plays daily at  pm and  pm there are usually a lot of people chilling and laying on the ground to watch but i found a really good viewing spot with what i personally think has a greater view of the park this entire park is very picturesque and i did not mind walking around for a couple hours to take in its beauty towards the back of the park there is an indoor food market with lots of yummy food,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,if you visit singapore i highly recommend coming here daytime to walk the huge garden night time to see the beautiful lights they also have attractions i chose to purchase the attraction bundle which included floral fantasy flower dome cloud forest and shuttle service to the last two the shuttle service is worth it especially after having walked the grounds of the entire garden in the  degree plus weather and enduring the high humidity the attractions are indoors in wonderfully temperature controlled man made environments there is a short little d film at the end of floral fantasy it is all beautiful for those of us who like to view different flora and fauna all in one place it is fun for the entire family each attraction exits you right into a great gift shop there is also a couple cafes located on the premises the one located right inside the flower dome looked like fun too bad i had just eaten the mrt drops you right off at the ticket booth discount for senior citizens  years and over,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the first thing to know about gardens by the bay is that it is one massive tourist attraction it has highly constructed facilities that you can pay to go into plus it has large gardens ponds and even a few aquariums around the property that are offered free of charge for many they find this location a great place to spend time with the family it is also a good place to get in a little exercise and walk and or run around personally for those of us who know what this area of singapore used to be like meaning those of us who are a little bit older we may remember what this area was once upon a time for me that was a much more ascetically pleasing period of time this is not to say that gardens by the bay is not a great place but i am just saying that it lacks any true singaporean culture so go here if you want to interact with a lot of tourists and see some marginally interesting tourist attractions but if you want to see what singapore is truly all about you may have to go to other locations,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i remember i was scrolling through a friends feed and there was a picture of him posed in front of the gardens by the bay in the background i was fascinated by the trees behind him in that picture which made me research more of singapore thus i thank my friend for planting the seed to visit singapore   years ago thanks jose in my opinion the gardens by the bay is synonymous to singapore as the same can be said about with the marina bay sands hotel they just go hand and hand together like dark chocolate dusted with sea salt together the gardens by the bay is a large park which is free to enter there is no admission to walk around the park i saw a lot of locals jogging around the park at night i cannot imagine doing that during the day that said the attractions which include the two domes the cloud forrest and flower dome and ocbc skyway are paid admission fees i encourage you to pay to see all three i only had the opportunity to see the two domes and missed the chance to go to the skyway but i was very particular as too when i wanted to go on the skyway since the paid admission is for only one usage the domes on the other hand allow you to get a re entry stamp when you exit which is valid for the entire day both the cloud forrest and the flower dome have their charm head to the flower dome if you want to immerse yourself in a bouquet of flowers from all over the world if you want to feel as if you are in a different planet go to the cloud forrest the cloud forrest also boasts having one of the largest indoor waterfalls it is a spectacular sight to witness with your own eyes explore both domes and learn about sustainability which is prevalent in the structure and urban planning of this beautify country i would encourage you to see the park both during the day and at night as the park truly gives off a different energy during both times in the evening there is a light show with the skytreees in the skytree grove that is mesmerizing note i would plan accordingly if you do go to the gardens at night last admission time for the ocbc skyway is pm also note that if there is a sign stating that there will be street food it is concession type food,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the super trees are just something straight out of the future there are art installations around the park including a slightly confusing giant naked baby lots to see and do for free even a trip to the top of the trees was worth the extra expense i accidentally ordered a  drink imported from japan while tasty was not worth the cost and my companions drinks were not fantastic but the view was amazing we came back at night and watched the light show which was relaxing and beautiful if you get there early i suggest laying down under a tree and watching it that way to save your neck if you time it correctly you can see the light show at the sands and walk over to the super trees and watch their light show or vice versa definitely would tell anyone who visits singapore to come here,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,this is one of the coolest attractions in singapore we were fortunate enough to have a room at the marina bay sands hotel which overlooked these memorizing trees i felt like we could not stop looking at them they are very easy to access from the hotel you walk away from them and head around the corner you take the elevator up to the th floor its the only floor you can go to and walk back into the hotel you will take the bridge across to the park the gardens are actually a large park that is free to enter we went at night and then went for a run the next morning to see them again i would encourage you to see the park both during the day and at night as the park truly gives off different views these trees were one of my favorite things in all of singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is just simply beautiful i saw crazy rich asians and since have been dying to check out this place and i am so glad i did it is one of the highlights in singapore it is a group of different attractions next to each other including cloud forest flower dome and the outside super tree grove it is an artificial man made area that is constructed to support different vegetations and flowers when we went it was tulip festival so lots and lots of tulips in the flower dome that were beautiful made for some great picture opportunities outside the gardens are the super trees that are just genius creations did not get a chance to walk around the trees on the skywalk due to our short visit but will definitely have to do that next time at night time they have a light and sound show where the trees are all lit up in different colors and it is just magical include this in your bucket list if not there already,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this experience was so worth it i bought tickets to both garden experiences and seeing all the plants from so many different terrains as well as the indoor waterfall were breathtaking stop by at night to see the light show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,singapore has come a long way in the past decade or so going all out with attractions open spaces to make it a very tourist friendly destination the outdoor parts of gardens by the bay are free to visit including the wonderful light music show at night there are plenty of dining options on premises you do not need to walk too far for restrooms i recommend visiting the gardens by the bay on your first night in singapore as it gives you a glimpse of the magic of that singapore has to offer to its tourists if you are in the mood for a nd light show on the same night the sands marina bay is within walking distance,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,wonderfully and different nature place in the concrete jungle of singapore with nearby skyscrapers quiet and into nature well worth a visit be prepared to walk,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,christmas is by far one of my favorite times of year to come visit family in singapore partly because of the decorations at the gardens christmas wonderland is probably singapore is biggest christmas fair with luminaire light sculptures games rides market santa is area and numerous other entertainment options there is also a human made blizzard massive christmas tree ice skating rink light show and let is not forget the food christmas carols add to the christmas cheer gardens christmas wonderland is the best place to celebrate christmas in singapore i would go at night as it adds to the already fantastic lights they have there you do have to buy tickets add it is not include in the regular garden entrance fee they are about  online more at the gate some sights give you a deal with flower dome cloud forest super tree grove ocbc skyway and christmas wonderland so look for that my cousin gets them for me so not sure what online service he uses there are several times the blizzard happens so check the times so you do not miss out lastly check the times for each area because they are different and some things close earlier than others,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,nightly laser show is free i came here after dinner nearby to enjoy the nightly laser show when i visited they had two shows at night  pm and  pm each show lasts about  minutes many people arrives early to secure places to sit no chairs or anything they bring picnic blanket to sit on the concrete floor i did not have anything with me so i just sat directly on the concrete floor but my clothes did not seem to get that dirty toilet facilities were nearby and inside was very clean laser show itself was okay i got bored after  minutes they continued to play different songs but laser show was the repeat of the same thing song choice was interesting i think i went on a special night where they played  is and  is some  is songs from the u s lot of them reminded me the fun time i had while in college laser show was beautifully done i have seen it once and not sure if i need to see it again,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,free free others areas you pay but mostly free the only thing i did not like is you cannot walk there from the flyer big spinning wheel which has a lot of food options this place however has fast food only quick snacks which is why you should come here after the wheel so you can eat up the big trees are massive and beautiful from every angle just sit there with ice cream and enjoy it at night you can walk above them but that cost a ticket and time in line singapore is not as hot as other places in asia so it is comfortable to walk around in one of the main attentions next to the lion hotel and wheel,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this has to be on your singapore bucket list went here for a walk after dinner at marina bay sands great views of mbs and the gardens are beautiful in the evening yes definitely most described as avatarish like scenery and atmosphere you have to enjoy this place on your own take lots of pictures and selfies go for a walk and relax it is much cooler during the evening,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is amazing it is so beautiful it is a must if your ever in town come by later in the evening check it out around sunset it is an unforgettable experience,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,we went on our last day in singapore and i am so glad we did everything about gardens by the bay is impressive from their impeccable floors restrooms to their nice people always willing to help the amount and variety of flowers we saw were outstanding and the gorgeous landscape design was on point nothing but the best to match the magnitude of the important marina bay sands hotel where this garden is located the only thing i did not like was the temperature inside the flower domes because it was so cold i was practically freezing but i understand that they do this to maintain the flowers and other plants,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,when in singapore this is a must we followed a crowd at night from marina bay sands they were headed to the supergrove trees everyone was picking a spot to sit on the street and were looking up as they were waiting for something we decided to do the same i believe it was around pm and a music light show started this was the best music light show i have ever seen just beautiful i got teary eyed it was so amazing they played american music from west side story to phantom of the opera the lights danced with the music gardens of the bay is a must visit,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,if you can only visit one attraction when you come to singapore this is it there is just nothing like this anywhere else while you are walking around there are a lot of places to stop to grab a bite or drink should you feel the need there are a few spots here that charge admission but it is well worth it the indoor waterfall was just beautiful inside the dome there is even a light show which you have to see this is a place i need to come back to at least once more in my life,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is beautiful garden at the reclaim land it has the beautiful setting for the garden this garden recycling energy and power the facility it collected the fallen leaves and burn it for energy we were here for the super trees these trees are man made they have the beautiful architecture look tree one to tree five has a walking bring across you can see the waterfall inside at night time the light out the threes with synchronized light and music it is beautiful to laid down on the floor to watch the show you can reach ther by mrt and across it with the dragon fly bridge it is great to see the super trees far away the garden have  sections some with pay entrantand some are free do you can pick what need to be cover the area is big to cover it also has  attraction many to visit,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a must visit place in singapore with about  hours layover in singapore we decided to leave the airport and made gardens by the bay our very first stop do not waste your time and try to save a little bit of money by taking the train download grab app it is the equivalent of uber here in singapore from the airport to the garden it was around  for us and only took about mins train would be over an hour it is free admission to gardens by the bay however the flower dome and cloud forest which located inside gardens by the bay hence the plural in gardens do require admission fees i highly recommend checking out those  as well especially if it is your first time in singapore they are well worth it there are bicycles for rent requires an app if you want to bike around the park or just venture on foot we saw plenty of runners and bikers around the perimeter of the garden since it was still early in the morning before am if you have watched crazy rich asians movie the last scene where the wedding happened was here at gardens by the bay and it is free you can also pay to go up to those huge supertree groves which connected by a view deck we spent a good   hours here with more than half of those in the flower dome and cloud forest and still did not get the chance to see everything definitely a place that we would love to come back to especially at night when the supertree grove is lit up,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it was the wedding party of the year in crazy rich asians gardens by the bay is supertree grove is over the top built in  on  acres of reclaimed land gardens by the bay has more than   million plants an indoor glass greenhouse complete with a waterfall and grove of  foot tall super trees that look like they would be more at home in james cameron is avatar but these trees also serve an environmental purpose they recycle rainwater and generate enough energy to sustain the adjoining conservatories how cool is that i visited the gardens during the day but many people suggest coming here at night to watch one of the free light shows the ocbc garden rhapsody happens each night from   to   pm the  minute show culminates in a grand finale where the trees sparkle with light the gardens by the bay conservatories are open from  am to  pm daily with the last admission at  pm the price is  singapore dollars or around  us dollars the outdoor gardens are open until  am and are free,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,must evening visitthis  acre swamp was reclaimed and made into a selfsustaining ecological park with a beautiful artificial tree grove decorated with sparkling lights and broadcasting festive seasonal music during the evenings the mammoth steel trees are connected by sky walks for the adventurous and daring close by and within the gardens premises is the flower dome featuring exotic plants and cloud forest as a modern botanical greenhouse the marina bay sands and singapore flyer are the featured towering structures just south of the gardens is the cruise terminal nearest mrt station is bayfront for cc or dt lines,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,my wife and i had a long layover in singapore we decided to visit the gardens by the bay as you walk into the garden you are welcomed by the beautiful waterfall that is the first photo opportunity of this beautiful location the garden is very well thought out easy to walk through and is setup to make sure you do not miss any of the displays we were lucky enough to go on a decent temperature day so it was perfect to walk around and enjoy the exhibit highly recommend to anyone visiting singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,beautiful a must see attraction if you are there i would recommend to come after it is dark because the entire garden gets lit up the view is just something else you have two options you can view it from the outside or you can walk on the skywalk it is so worth it to come here also at night they have a light show too and i highly recommend staying for it,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,wow probably the most amazing thing in singapore come during the day and do the cloud forest and flower dome walk the park skip the indochine restaurant and rooftop bar do the skybridge instead either night or day are both awesome they have a light show at night if you want to catch the show come on a weekday as it will be crowded if you just want to see the lights come after the show as it will be empty and you can take plenty of photos without the crowds,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,expect to spend at the very least half a day at this site really to get enough hours you should schedule a full day this place is extremely unique with a blend of modern technology and style with traditional botanical elements the flower dome is full of flowers from all over the world while the cloud dome spoiler literally has a waterfall coming from the top of a mountain full of vegetation and a winding path end both domes have indoor cooling and humidity to match the needs of the plants they also had themes inside the flower dome when i visited since it was nearing christmas after these two domes you can choose to walk around the gardens and especially to the super trees these structures are full of plants inside and light up in the evening for a fee you can also walk on the paths between the trees in the tree canopy from here you can get beautiful views of the marina sands bay hotel also you can book tickets online or wait in line to purchase entrance tickets there was not a long wait but it could get long as there is only a handful of ticket windows on the day we went there were brief showers and it was very humid wear waterproof shoes or shoes you do not mind getting a little wet,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,we came both during the day and for the   pm show at night you see two different parks the colors structures and plants look different but i have to say my favorite was during the night time and the lights music show it starts right on the sport at   and it lasts  min you can sit anywhere in the park and you will enjoy it just as much all the super trees are part of the show and the best part it is that is for free,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is magical great customer service we bought tickets for cloud forest and the flower dome the sky walk was closed the line was moving quickly and took me about ten minutes meanwhile my  year old got busy with the craft there are dedicated staff members who were engaging kids to make paper flowers they were making roses we did flower dome first there are millions of flowers and most of the aisles from different countries have amazing natural fragrances this place is one of its kind cloud forest was exceptional too i could not go up to feel the clouds or on the walk way as my kids were super sleep but whatever i could experience and specially the varieties of orchids and it is fragrance was unique and one memorable experience there is kids area as well due to thunder storm and rains the games were not fully open the part of super tree grove area was nicely decorated for promotion of kids movie my daughter enjoyed whatever she could experience  stars for building this place and for top notch customer experience,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,if you visit singapore even for a day and skip the gardens by the bay you are doing it wrong it is a very unique experience in the tropical climate it is a must go place whether you are a local or visitor they constantly bring in seasonal flowers and plants from all over the world you get to enjoy all this at the comfort of cool temperature and humidity must visit this place to get the info how trees plants are helping us to live in this world gardens by the bay singapore is one of the most famous place in the world it is amazing you will feel something different which is directly connected with mother nature i love this place and specially the show they put up every evening around  pm strongly recommend buying a ticket to get up to the super trees sky deck during the show and watch them up close everything is so well maintained walking by the road along the river you can come to marina bay mall where is nice artificial reservoir outside with water lilies you can also see the singapore eye on the other side the art and creativity was fantastic it was one of my memorable travels visiting this place at singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,great attraction for any person to visit i purchased the flower dome cloud forest admission and thought it was well worth it it took me about   hours to go through both the maintenance and care the facility has for the plants is amazing also i suggest you go the the skywalk it is a pretty view of the city and the super trees i spent  for admission and  for the skywalk and i thought it was worth it i highly recommend anyone to go who is never gone also since it is near the marina bay sands i would just walk there after it is only a  mins walk and you can walk around in there and go on either the sky park get a drink or just go to the casino,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,wow wow wow this might have been the nicest garden i have ever been to in my life i recommend going here if you are in singapore i am super sad i did not have much time here i did however get to ride on their golf cart for the  minute tour around the garden i would recommend that if you are on a time limit or would like to have a baseline and familiarize yourself to the garden being in singapore made me rethink a lot of things about life in the usa i always had a mindset that america was very advanced compared to other countries singapore helped me realize that there is always room for improvement the giant super trees in the garden helped me realize this the trees function the same ways as natural trees do however with even more benefits but just multiplied it is amazing how much effort is put into making the environment and quality of life that much better in singapore being at the garden helped me appreciate nature more there are different gardens known as the heritage gardens that are dedicated to all the countries that helped influence singapore is culture there are even beautiful sculptures located throughout the park i would say this is a must see to visit and someone could easily spend half a day maybe even a full day here i was not able to but i was told that there is a beautiful light show that happens during the night time i would absolutely come back here,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is beautiful and so clean no matter where you walk there is nature surrounding you take a walk amongst the supergrove trees or walk on solid ground and explore the amazing statues do try the supertree by indochine bar to get the best  views another must do is the cloud forest it is truly breathtaking the flower dome is best during the day as night is very dark inside go by the cafe to smell the amazing herbs that are growing,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the place is amazing and awesome the beauty of singapore we love it so much highly recommended for everyone visiting singapore super elegant design both interior and exterior especially during the night,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,get tickets online for both domes cloud forest and flower dome and skip the lines i was able to go right in super convenient loved the cloud forest so much i went twice definitely go earlier so that you basically have the whole place to yourself and get some great photos but also marvel at the majestic waterfalls it is super calming to watch the water fall from the very top to the bottom used to be the tallest manmade waterfall before it got bested by the jewel and wander through all the interesting types of plants growing everywhere do not forgot to take an awesome photo from the top also get a re entry stamp when exiting in case you want to visit again,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i was very excited to come to the gardens by the bay i think the supertrees have reached almost an iconic stature and people easily recognize what and where they are i was surprised by the sheer size of the park itself yes there is the supertree grove and the cloud forest but keep walking toward the water and there are ponds and grass areas satay by the bay delicious and the marina barrage which i think was my most favorite part i saw many people hanging out and working out and i think that if i lived here i might spend some time in these gardens as well the upkeep was impeccable i saw some work being done while i walked through and it was nice to see how well maintained the entire place is i would definitely recommend coming here when you visit singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,yes this place is as great as everyone says it is i was able to catch the light show and was pleasantly surprised that classical music is played while the super grove trees lit up to the beat,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,one of my favorite attractions in singapore walking the gardens is free however if you want to go into the domes you have to pay a fee the cloud forest dome was truly amazing and worth the money i enjoyed learning about how singapore has worked on sustainable water projects and making ecological changes for the country the simulated cloud forest was truly beautiful with mists the walk is quite steep and strenuous if you are not used to walking uphill i believe there was an elevator to the different levels but you do not quite get the full experience as when you hike up the incline the other dome has a desert garden and plants from around the world they have a large baobab tree that i have seen when i was working in zimbabwe they also have a lot of desert cacti from arizona where i live now pretty cool and surreal to see plants in my neighborhood in my heritage country definitely add gardens at the bay to your visit check out the night laser show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,must see gorgeous but yet completely different from any botanic experience you have ever seen go inside the cloud forest for unique sculptures amongst rainforest inside a cosmopolitan metropolis not to mention a cool respite from constant humidity go during the week if possible to avoid the masses,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,this area is huge we came here in august and it was so hot outside so we spent most of our time in flower dome and cloud forest both are unique and provide ample photo opportunities we planned a very packed day and was not able to get to this place until the sun started to set the sky outside got dark but the insides were dimly lit so we were able to enjoy everything even though it was getting late seems like they change the displays often so i would definitely to go back if given the opportunity things i would have done differently  set aside at least  hours to see everything and to take my time and  worn more comfortable shoes for all the walking  dress nice to get some nice pictures of myself amongst the beautiful displays,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,wow this is a beautiful and must visit spot the free parts are mesmerizing with the light towers ceramic animal statues and beautiful flowers you have to pay about  to visit the  dome i definitely recommend it the cloud forest dome was amazing and worth every penny the orchids are ornate and again beautiful the cloud forest is fascinating and the scenes witnessed while walking are captivating the other dome is a desert garden i did not have a lot of time to visit the dome but i also heard that the cloud forest dome was the better of the  to visit if needing to see only one,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is amazing we walked across the bridge from marina bay sands and started with the supertree grove this gets you to the height of the supertrees and a great view of the city it is worth coming back twice to see the supertress during the day and then back at night for the light show the other  attractions are the flower dome and cloud forest both were spectacular there were a variety of plants and even some cherry blossoms we went at the end of march it is also nice and cool and a great change from the  degree weather outside the indoor waterfall was amazing as well def a must see in singapore it was a highlight of our trip,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,plan to spend a few hours here at gardens of the bay it took us about four hours to do the entire thing and we were moving fast i enjoyed the night show with lights we just laid on the ground with the hundreds of other people the gardens are superb,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the funny thing about these types of places is even when they are not just awful tourist traps they still never seem to live up to the expectations my last job in the usa was working for the parks dept for three years so i know a little about parks but gardens by the bay is no park that place is a revelation there was not a single thing about it that i found overrated or anything even close to that the attention to detail here is otherworldly which is pretty much par for the course when you are talking about places in singapore but still very much welcomed we even had second thoughts about going on the canopy because it costs money but even that was worth the trip plus you can stay up there as long as you want really what we did not get a chance to do was go to the bar that is up in one of the huge trees but that is ok we were looking for a reason to go back to singapore anyway the park is also huge so while most of the photos are the giant trees and such there is a lot of park to traverse so it is not like you are stuck in just one place this may be one of my new favorite parks on earth if not my new,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,took a night tour that brought us to the avatar trees light and music show it was retro night and the music was excellent my son and i loved the tunes including is aturday night fever and abba songs it was not as crowded due to the rain so we had prime viewing do be ready for people unaware and who wander into your video taping area we did not have time to explore the walkways linking the trees but it looked fun the garden rhapsody light and sound show is a definite must visit and if you have time the flower dome and cloud forest look like good places to visit as well the trees mimic live trees in that they have technology which allows them to convert sunlight into energy and collect rainwater there is also a restaurant at the top of the tallest tree but we never made it there overall a great place to visit,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,wow singaporean does everything exceedingly well and this place is a perfect example of that the  sights garden and cloud garden were incredible they display the plants as if they are museum pieces everything was meticulously placed and displayed this is another must visit place while visiting singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,absolutely a must visit every inch of this place is amazing art mixed with the most beautiful plant life and greenery the cloud forest felt like stepping into a dream with all of its hidden treasures and wooden carvings every turn reveals a new wonder this is a place that should not be missedgardens by the bay was the highlight of my trip to singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is one of my favorites place to visit every time i am in singapore its spectacular light show runs nightly and it is free it is better to come here a bit earlier like around  pm to explore the garden and sees beautiful tropical flower collections around if you want to see more cool flower collections you also can visit the dome but you have to pay the fee after the light show you can head toward the marina bay sands hotel to check the cool lobby and continue to event plaza along the promenade to see the spectra a light and water show the spectra water show runs at  and  pm nightly except the weekend they runs in different times happy exploring,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the water playground for kids is free and os always covered and not sunny at all there is a cafe beside and a playground on the other side a go to place for kids its wondeful the garden itself impressive but maybe mot for everyone,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,singapore at its finest this place is so far the best representation of what the average tourist is looking for scenic views cultural design and hella things to take pictures of it is hot af so dress appropriately and bring sneakers so many beautiful structures to oooooo and ahhhhh at as well as  things to pay for cloud forest and flower dome were  sgd personally cloud forest was worth every penny it is such a clever design of man made plant life flower dome was better for people who do not have a fear of heights but jesus i hate people in my personal space so we breezed through this one the skyway so picture perfect to end your night with a concerto of color sound and light imo not worth it to wait in line to buy a ticket to wait in line to go up top f that noise we laid down and chilled lol,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is a must visit in singapore and if you stay in the marina bay sands you can just walk over through the marina bay sands mall and pathway each part of the park has different costs so we were able to experience the christmas wonderland for  singaporean dollars and  for the floral fantasy beautiful day and night and recommend to go before  pm to see it in the day and then when it lights up at  pm we got to experience the holiday decorations there too since it is december huge park and lots to see,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place was magnificent my husband and i enjoyed renting a scooter and a bike and ride it alongside the water although the weather in singapore was very humid and hot but the place was lovely and clean,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,garden by the bay is a new kid on the block attraction for this nation there are now two major garden park attractions the other is the original botanical gardens whether you like the singapore botanical garden or the few year old garden by the bay is completley subjective tour guides and locals suggested garden by the bay because it is indoors and a real catharsis from the intense humidity personally i am not really into flowers and plants but this garden attraction has a lot more to offer than plants i did not go to the botanical gardens but from what i gathered it has been here longer than when singapore was established  singapore became a natiom in  so for old school and lover of history the original park may be ideal this newer garden park that began operations in  is much more in touch with the digital age and technology and is as large as epcot center in florida which is around  acre and five times larger than universal studios in sentosa because it is so large i will focus on two indoor attractions both could take up  hours all together one is the cloud forest dome and the other is the floral fantasy there is a flower dome but would rather focus on the two because the two above are more interactive cloud forest is one of the attractions in a premise of attractions onto itself it is a indoor replication of highly elevated tropical mountain enviornments found in neighboring malaysia and indonesia specifically on the island of borneo as you walk in to the building you ate meet by a crisp clear indoor waterfall you will also see many plants relating to those regions and it goes around several floors and has interactive sights educating tourists of mountain forests as vital forces in the ecosystem it definatley felt like a technological and imaginative museum as you exit the place there is a twenty minute film of mountainous tropical rain forests floral fantasy like the cloud forest dome is also innately geared for tech savvy fantasy connoisseurs it felt more like a disney like attraction of floral aristry with colorful bouquet of flowers moving around there is also a  d motion simulator my favorite decpicting the journey of a dragon fly moving around the whole park just remember you may have to come on seperate days for these attractions because some are opened and close on various days the rest of the park has gardens relating to plants around the region the most famous out door attractions are the supertree grove these are very tall plants that are also part of the light shows in the night,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,one of singapore is most popular attraction and for good reason gardens by the bay is free to enter but it will cost to visit the exhibits flower dome and cloud forest the super trees are spectacular to see in person it is worth planning your visit around the light show in the evenings it is on everyday with two showings whichever time you go to go earlier to grab a good spot for the show and for your pictures it gets very crowded i found that buying tickets online through third party vendors is cheaper and more convenient as you avoid the lines you can also purchase at most hotels or online for pickup at the counter there are multiple entrances into the park but even those get backed up during peak hours set aside a few hours if you are planning to visit all the attractions plan accordingly so you can catch the light show which goes on twice a night after sunset,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,if you only have time to visit just one major attraction in singapore then gardens by the bay is the place to go and i believe that most singaporeans will agree with me it is a combination of sophisticated architecture and a meticulous conservation and recreation of mother nature it is a fantasyland enclosed in two domed shaped conservatories that when viewed from high above are almost like the signature of singapore is marina bay area admission to the grounds of the garden itself is actually free but you have to pay for admissions to the two conservatories sin  which are really the main reasons that you are there the two domes are the flower dome and cloud forest and each has its own unique and distinct theme the flowers in the flower dome are seasonal and during our last visit orchids were the main theme there were also numerous other delightful flowers and plenty of photo opportunities its beauty and breathtaking experience is beyond words the highlight of the cloud forest was the waterfall when we first entered then we navigated through a series of elevators and walkways which guided us through a rainforest like environment captured within a structure with stunning architecture on a bright and sunny day you can immerse yourself in the glorious beauty within the dome while seeing the amazing skyline of singapore through the glass walls each dome felt like a dream capsule to me with the real world outside of my fantasy but within my reach other than the two domed conservatories another area to visit is the supertree grove which is free and is also the stage of the evening light show garden rhapsody while you are in the area check out the skyway sin   which is an aerial walkway about  feet or so high that is linked to the tops of the supertrees other areas to visit include the bay east garden by the waterfront as well as the heritage gardens and sun pavilion this place is huge and it is easy to get lost and we did but it is perfectly fine to get lost in paradise,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a truly amazing attraction which showcases singapore is ingenuity in attracting tourists to such a small island nation with virtually no natural attractions all the  big attractions cloud forest flower dome and floral fantasy are paid but well worth the money the supertree grove holds a free light and sound show every evening which is worth watching too,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,so beautiful my first impression when i first approached the super grove trees was how grand they were and how they looked like they came out of an avatar movie they are not real trees but they have natural and synthetic elements to them they also collect solar energy amazing they have light shows at   and   pm at night and they are free the combination of various colors and music was just a sight to see just be ready with some mosquito repellent though standing there watching the light show i felt like i was dinner for some blood sucking hungry mosquitoes unfortunately we were not able to see all parts of the gardens by the bay but you can definitely make it an all day visit with the light show being at night i cannot wait to visit the other parts of this attraction when i come back to singapore again,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is huge it has  conservatories and an outdoor garden outdoor garden is free and if you do not feel like walking please take the audio tour it is  per person and tour is about  mins for both conservatories entrance fee is  but i bought tickets from a handy device it is a phone equipped with internet with apps and deals for  per piece handy device is provided by my hotel and it is complimentary love it some of the flowers in the flower garden are seasonal we did not get to see tulips but were in luck for japanese cherry blossoms another cool thing that was happening they had a japanese event going on as well you can rent the yukata japanese traditional clothes for  and take pics around the conservatory my mom and brother truly enjoyed this there is a light and audio show at pm and pm be prepared to walk a lot,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,starsgardens by the bay was one of the main highlights for me during my singapore trip my dad and i came here around pm and it was not blazing hot to explore the area at that time admission is free but you have to buy admission tickets for some of the attractions here e g flower dome cloud forest ocbc skyway i think you will need almost half the day to see everything here we mainly focused checking out the super grove tree and taking photos of this amazing place we also watched the garden rhapsody light show at the super grove tree at night there is two daily performances at  pm and  pm you should come to this spot early to get a good viewpoint and it will be crowded too it was an amazing sight to see the super grove trees light up and blink to the background music overall gardens by the bay is a must see in by books take the mrt to bayfront stop which runs along the circle yellow line and downtown blue line,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,keep in mind that it is singapore so any time you spend outside will be hot and humid and you will immediately feel super sticky we bought a bundle of tickets on voyagin that included the flower dome cloud forest ocbc skywalk and christmas wonderland seasonal for about  sgd a ticket vs  sgd for just flower dome and cloud forest if you do not buy online the downside is that you have to stop by tower  of marina bay sands to pick up the tickets first but while you are there it is a perfect time to hop on the elevator and check out the skypark also available as part of the bundled ticket i have posted separate reviews for flower dome cloud forest ocbc skywalk was fine i would maybe pay  sgd for the experience christmas wonderland was definitely disappointing they put up some lights and there are some food trucks that is about it if you do not want to buy the bundled ticket you can access flower dome for free by dining at pollen and you can access the skypark for free by dining at ce la vi,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,very cool place here i took the shuttle into the park and hit up the flower and cloud domes definitely check these out once after that i wondered around the gardens and enjoyed my time there if you get a chance grab an ice cream because it is hot as f in singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,eh the first word that comes to mind is pretentious the next five words that come to mind are loud obnoxious tourists with cameras the layout is lots of free space where anyone can stroll about in the sweltering heat with average gardening and various figurines from large dragonflies a big baby in fetal position and a bunch of unmemorable statues to get here you simply take the red line towards marina bay and follow signs to the sands hotel and gardens by the bay the gbtb are behind the marina bay sands on a hot day which amounts to most days in singapore it is about a   minute walk thru intense humidity and heat if there are no clouds it is hopeless without an umbrella you will die of thirst without water and you will sweat no matter how strong the deodorant but if you survive and make it to the visitor center you can buy tickets and pay to cool down and visit playful indoor air conditioned gardens one is cloud forest this leads you by a waterfall just a bunch of water dumped from  floors above within this plant and tree biodome it takes you up where you see a bunch of things where before you can appreciate someone gets in your way to take photos i do not understand why because it is not really all that photogenic it is nice space but none of my pictures were that interesting the walk way  floors up is pretty interesting and what do you from  floors up within this biodome take photos of a bunch of people below looking back up and taking photos of you the only things i recalled liking were the dragon carvings the bhutanese cypress and the magnified baby orchids the other biodome is the flower dome they really should call it the cacti dome the african baobabs were kinda neat there were also a bunch of cacti from mexico bolivia zimbabwe and probably other places i was too busy ducking people or being bumped into it was turbulously uncivil it gets  stars being air conditioned but  stars for the elevators i thought i was gonna suffocate in all the elevators i got on i think if it were  degrees fahrenheit or less and about   fewer people i might actually enjoy this place to me it amounts to being the classic tourist trap where you dodge loud obnoxious and excited people taking photos just like disneyland the epcot center times square montmartre niagara falls the eiffel tower and any other of a thousand places in this planet where  million people have it marked on their bucket list to see all in all to compulsive extroverts this place is five stars to compulsive introverts this place is  star i am somewhere in between so i will give it  stars,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,if there is one place you must not skip while visiting singapore it is the gardens in the bay you should not miss at all costs the massive supertrees here these are the steel framed tree shaped vertical gardens that are between  to  meters tall there are  supertrees in total the highest of which offers fine dining and bar with  view of the city these trees are covered in different varieties of ferns orchids and bromeliads you can even go up the suspended walkway  meters high to see a panoramic view of the garden at night catch the gardens light and music show with choreographed lights and sounds of the supertrees it sure does feel enchanting and magical it is free to enter the supertree grove but there is a fee to the elevated walkway as well as the flower dome and cloud forest which are also part of the gardens of the bay other parts that are free to the public include children is garden golden garden heritage gardens world of plants the canyon sun pavilion art sculptures dragonfly and kingfisher lakes etc see pdf copy of the map in attached pics such a huge park is not it well it covers  acres so wear comfortable shoes bring lots of water and expect a lot of walking it is worth it,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,surprisingly good tourist attraction one of the things you have to see while in singapore worth the trip and the hype especially if it is your first time here the indoor waterfall is impressive and the flower exhibition regularly change every   months so there is always something new to see it is all indoors and air conditioned so it is a chance to get out of the heat and humidity also very good for photos highly recommended,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,loved the orchids exhibition could be better it is very spacious and well maintained yet i just do not feel particularly inspired as once a regular at the california academy of sciences i found it a little underwhelming,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,magical gardens by the bay have been on my bucket list for the longest of time admission is super affordable and the amount of space to cover is endless make sure you come about  hours prior to closing to see everything with lights words cannot explain how beautiful and serene it was i felt like i was warped into a different world if you are ever in singapore please do not skip this place,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,second time here with my hubby i guess this was one of our favorite spot an amazing and inspirational place to visit the hotel was a bit pricey but worth every penny we stayed here for a week room was super clean the pool absolutely amazing enjoyed every aspect an unforgettable stay,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,mind blown this is one of my favorite places to visit in singapore so stunning and mesmerizing with a veritable cornucopia of foliage light and textures intermarrying in perfect harmony truly there is so much beauty to take in here although the gardens are massive you can easily walk around the entire property within an hour but do not rush enjoy the absolute tranquility of tropical greenery tall water fall and exotic flora which offer a much needed treat for the eyes and senses my favorite section of the garden is walking through the winding trails of cloud forest dome it feels like entering a mysterious world veiled in mist next we stepped into the flower dome which display unique plant bloom that are equally awe inspiring after sun down do check out the garden rhapsody at the supertree grove the whole music light performance is absolutely dazzling ending the night on high we walked across the ocbc skyway which gives an amazing city view tips visiting outside the dome and skyway are free tickets for  domes skyway is  at door but cheaper if you can get it through third party online the last entrance for each dome skyway is at  p m but they let you stay til  p m bring your camera,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is one place in singapore that you truly cannot miss right now it is their christmas theme so after pm you have to get additional tickets i wish i had come in the evening however i was limited in time so all my photos are from the daytime upon arrival you can go to check out the super trees they are very stunning and a lot more beautiful in person than any picture could capture there is also a skywalk to walk amongst the tops such a breathtaking experience another awesome place is a restaurant they have at the top of one however i did not personally go to check it out after your fascination with the trees i highly advise getting tickets for both the flower dome and the cloud forest both are so extraordinary and nothing like ive ever seen before,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,super crowded arrive early it is free so crowds pull in towards the later half of the day two other things you must check out must pay  flower dome lots of flowers and plants from all over the world  cloud dome lots of plants and tall water fallsboth are a one time thing get ready to be overwhelmed the gardens by the bay has an amazing light show that comes on post   a must watch marina bay sands laser show can also be seen from down here,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,simply wonderful a must see experience make sure to get up on the supertree grove sothat you can fully enjoy the view the orchids are my favorite flower i really enjoy seeing themevery where in the garden so much to see and enjoy,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,stunning gardens with a fantastic light show i love that the light show changes with the seasons do not forget to swing past spectra on your way home in the front of mbs,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,honestly not sure why the ratings are so high it is a nice place that a lot of effort has gone in to but  plus  is definitely not worth it on the plus the cool temperature inside the domes is refreshing,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,in the middle of gardens by the bay one of the world is most amazing and famed botanical gardens dwells is one of the world is beautiful eco garden the supertree grove was the result of a international design comptetion project initiated by the singaporean government as part of a initiative to transform singapore to a city within a garden from a garden city the supertrees in the grove were designed as tree shaped eco structures up to  meters in height acting as vertical growth platforms for many plants ranging from ferns to orchids and they are designed to collect solar power rainwater and absorb air for the garden functionality in a similar fashion to actual trees role in nature there is an evlevated path called skyway which provides a nice walk and aerial view of the grove the garden and the singapore skyline accessible from within the garden every evening the grove and it is supertrees come alive with lights and coordinated music which changes in themes occasionally for the enjoyment of visitors the experience is suited for all ages and it is highly recommended to just come in and lay flat on the ground watch towards the supertree tops and as night falls immerse in the music and enjoy the light show this world class experience has no admission and the show is free for all thanks to the singaporean government on top of the biggest supertree there is a restaurant called supertree by indochine in which you can grab a tad bit pricy drink or dinner in front of a spectacular view of the gardens and the city,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,what a beautiful tranquil innovative place to be come here to hang with nature people from all over the world tourists singaporeans expats you name it you have got it your favourite person people and more take a long walk jog stroll through the gardens revere in the different species of plants and if you have money to spare check out flower dome and cloud forest they are like two ginormous human made ecosystems flower dome switches out their selection of flowers from time to time and houses plant species from all over the world cloud forest houses plants found in higher altitudes so expect it to be a little moist and chilly but still comfortable during special occasions such as christmas and new year the giant trees in the gardens light up to synchronised music amazing bring your comfy walking shoes the gardens are quite large and wear light and comfy clothing singapore is hot and humid and have a great time,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,so incredibly beautiful with flowers lush gorgeous and plentiful magnificent colors and textures it is free to get in but the exhibits cost and are well worth it,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i enjoyed my visit here this summer though would have enjoyed it more without the flash flood i was here both in the early morning and at night for the light show the sunrise by the river is beautiful it tends to be quite quiet with just a few professional photographers and joggers around and you can catch the sun creeping up over the city the nightscape is also lovely though the light show is a little overhyped it is recorded music and some flashing lights on the man made trees it is also much more crowded the other highlight was the little gardens meant to capture the different cultural influences on singapore i finally know what a coffee plant looks like now it is a lovely place to visit especially for free if you do not include the greenhouses would recommend making the trip come early before am to avoid crowds,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,what gardens not sure why singapore decided it would be a good thing to dedicate the precious few acres of land that they call gardens by the bay to a mediocre version of meaningless do not get me wrong for kids and those who yearn for any bit of nature this is still a wonderful facility when you get there early the paid sections of the cloud forest and flower garden are welcome diversions of the open air hot and humid parts of the garden i can totally appreciate the environmental stewardship message that gardens by the bay is trying to convey when it comes to the gift shop it appears though that commercial interests far outweigh any interest in sustainability if the amount of useless trinkets they sell is any indication plus the fact that a country of origin of their merchandise seems hard to come by meaning it is from china and therefore bad for the environment pass,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay was absolutely my favorite place we visited in singapore this place is truly incredible just from the outside it can be seen in all of its beauty gardens by the bay is truly an beautiful site there are a few exhibits to check out you can checkout cloudscape which because an indoor habitat that makes you feel like you are floating in the sky it is full of flowers beauty and wonder there is also a gardenscape which makes you feel like you are in a flower heaven and swirled down into alice in wonderland i truly loved this place one of the best parts was the walkway that lets you over see the garden but also gives you great views of the city around  pm you can see a beautiful light show with a great story line to show off the skyline and cityscape of singapore it displays their country pride and gives a great rundown of their history in a entertaining form it is definitely a family friendly place now there is also a restaurant in one of the trees and it is like an observation deck you can eat or grab drinks and get great day time or nighttime views of the city,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,amazing could spend a whole day here recommend going just before it gets dark so you see the light show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a top tourist attraction which i wish i got to spend more time at there is an entry fee for the flower dome and cloud gate you can also take a golf cart to and from both for a small additional price if you show proof that you took singapore airlines there is a small discount flower dome had more plants than actual flowers cloud gate has a rainfall within it and several levels both are worth the additional price to explore if i returned i would definitely come back a little later in the evening to see it all lit up and walk the sky way,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,overall very beautiful place to see trees flowers and more the place is huge so you can spend hours here i stayed there until i could not walk anymore the outside part was tough after a while because it is not all covered so the heat can really get to you also the food options are a bit on the cheap end for a garden there should be more organic healthy and fresh options bottom line this is definitely worth the visit but if you want to see the outdoor attractions make sure to come early into morning or late at night the food options are not great expect fried chicken and fast food type foodproswell laid out so many good view points of the bay lots of flowers and tree varieties cons need more shaded areas throughout better food options,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,as one of the main attractions in singapore gardens by the bay is not to be missed tickets costs  pp and you may find promotional coupons online that can reduce the price by  we visited in the evening hours and can say without a doubt that our experience was magical both flower dome and cloud forest should not be missed combo ticket includes access to both upon arrival we noticed the park get illuminated after sunset and this makes for a beautiful night visit we started on the dome and then moved to the forest i would say plan for    hour visit there is lots to see and this time would allow you not to be rushed when visiting at night there is a cool light music show in the supertree grove at  and  definitely plan accordingly because it is worth checking out we absolutely loved it btw dome and forest are air conditioned so they are a great place to escape the heat sin can be warm and walking in ac makes everything better food and bev can be had in the street food area or hawker centre like hall lots of options some cheap some enjoy,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,wonderful place to spend a day in singapore esp to decompress from the city is hyperactivity easy mrt ride air conditioned clean punctual subways to the garden friendly and helpful staff reasonable ticket prices such dazzling displays of plants you cannot see in one place anywhere else in the world that i know topiary and sculptures that make people smile and laugh huge domes cloudforest and flower of plants water features and scenic backdrops the tree towers all adjacent to the iconic marina bay sands hotel and bay i walked  miles in the gardens that day i visited,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this review is for strolling through the gardens at night the gardens was beautifully lit on a thursday night i did not pay the additional fee to ride to the top of one of the lit super trees there is also an indoor walkway from one tree to another besides looking at the nicely lit super trees i would say my favorite experience here was walking through the actual park there are a couple of life size art pieces throughout the grassy area with little placards of explanation the garden is completely safe at night even around pm i saw many joggers running since it was hot and humid in mid may i got parched quickly luckily there is a little area that sells cold drinks i got a refreshing rose drink lastly strolling through the garden at night is a nice date idea if you are lucky you may catch the garden to be quite empty,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,my first time visiting gardens by the bay year  two years have passed we are in year  every year i travelled to singapore i would visit gardens by the bay making a trip to the gardens is like a trip to orchard road nowadays except i do not have to spend too much here i now have the annual membership to the gardens lol i really enjoy walking around and taking my time to admire the flowers and plants around me it gives me a sense of serenity it is a peaceful sanctuary amidst a bustling city of cos like even in an oasis there is a chance there will be unruly visitors screaming talking loudly or kids running about sigh i try to ignore these people and focus on the beautiful surroundings my aunt asked me why i kept going to gardens by the bay i replied i love flowers she shook her head and said you are such a typical woman not sure what she really meant lol i think i am more excited about looking at those flowers at the gardens than having flowers showed up at my door opps i mean at my condo is concierge desk haha i highly recommend any visitor to singapore to visit both flower dome and cloud forest at least once hours and admissions are as follows as of july   conservatoriesdaily am pmlocal resident is rate single conservatory adult  senior citizen  and above years old  child   years old double conservatories adult  senior citizen  and above years old  child   years old standard rate non resident adult child  outdoor gardensdaily am amfree admission outdoor gardens consist of supertree grove sun pavillion heritage gardens world of plants dragonfly kingfisher lakesocbc skywaydaily am pmadult child,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,amazing place a must see in singapore prepare to spend a few hours there wear comfortable shoes if you are not used to colder climate bring a jacket although it is a man made nature garden its beautifully done lots of outdoor greens and fiona to walk see and  indoor domes with climate controlled environment for delicate plants this place does look like it needed lots of tender loving care and maintenance but the staffs have done a great job improving it we were bumped the flower dome is closed for maintenance today though so we only managed to visit the forest dome next time we will come back to revisit,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,wow this place was better than i expected i was thinking that i would be walking a while and since it was so hot in singapore i expected to sweat quite a bit wonderful surprise that these gardens are covered and have ac that was awesome it cost  sd to enter two of the gardens and they are well worth it this place is definitely a must when you visit singapore it is truly beautiful,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,if you are in singapore and only have time for  activity this is the one it is very unique and i have never been anywhere like it there is a free large section for anyone who likes gardens and greenery to walk around outside but the  indoor dome comes at a cost about  usd well worth the price and the fact that there is ac singapore is hot all year round with  humidity the first dome is a flower dome with the most gorgeous collection of flowers from all around the world it is setup in a way that you wo not get bored nor tired of seeing flowers there were creative alice in wonderland themed sections etc the nd doom was the cloud forest the name says it all you are in a forest type environment with a indoor waterfall all man made and you can climb up to the top and feel like you are walking on top of the trees it was scary for me as i hate heights but it is a unique experience to check out at night this place lights up so gorgeous and the light show is in the free section so it would be a romantic thing to check out with your other half the location was very easy to get to by public transportation bus subway it is right next to the famous marina bay sands a must do in singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,do you want to be stunned by the beauty of nature and technology do you want to breathe probably the freshest air in the whole do you want to see lights dance to music if yes to any of all this place is easily one of my favorite places i have ever seen from  huge enclosed buildings with a cloud forest and stunning pieces of plants that are art this place just really impresses you one step into those buildings and you truly feel like you can breathe another amazing thing is the fact they have different designs for the plants from things like alice in wonderland to dragons to peoples face blending into the plants now to the best thing these lighted towers that look like huge trees not only can you go up there in the day time and walk around the walkway there is also a bar at the top of the highest one then at night there is a show which was like around   and   if i remember correctly and it would dance to the music with some of the most beautiful color schemes truly one of the most amazing places i have ever been and i really look forward to coming back,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,brilliant for somebody who is not into flowers and the like it was fantastic to see the area with different plants from around the world was very interesting and the walking around the different levels with the view was awesome the water playground in the parks were loved by the kids the only downside to our day was the cost and quality of the overpriced second rate food in the food court this venue is a must see if you are going to singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the displays were fabulous some of the animal figures were carved out of wood and others were made by putting branches and twigs together to form a shape also the flowers were amazing and the smell of growing living flowers cannot be beaten the displays were artfully done and very impressive,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,i went here to scout out the location of the super trees and it was such a beautiful experience i opted not to go into the green houses because the lines were ridiculous so i strolled through the gardens and hung out at super tree they offer a light show at pm which i watched nightly from my room but it was so impressive to be up close to the trees there are opportunities for beautiful photos at every turn and its a place where even a novice photographer could get relatively impressive shots the gardens are free to enter unless you want to go into the green houses or the bridge in the canopy of the super trees this would make a great family outing there are areas to picnic and just relax if you need to there is also a water park on site for the kiddos as well if you ever find yourself in singapore i highly suggest it not so humbly submitted michael c,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i tried to review this beautiful place last year when i was here now i can the four of us took a tour at this national site when here gbtb is a required staple so beautiful and interesting it is the most interesting cooled conservatories in the world,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,so i came here for  to  hours and ended up spending the day here the variety of plant life here is spectacular there is so much to see and learn to get here you can either crossover the dragonfly bridge from marina bay sands or take the metro to bayfront entry is free to most of the park however there is an entry fee for the domes the flower dome and the cloud forest dome i highly recommend these they are really spectacular you will learn a lot and the air conditioning will revive you additionally there is an area called satay by the bay where you can buy all types of local foods and treats in the evening i saw hundreds of runners along beautiful path between the flower dome and the bayi recommend going in the late afternoon early evening so that you can enjoy the gardens in the sunlight and in the evening when everything is beautifully lit,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,flower dome and cloud forest were both awesome flower dome has lots of different flowers from across the world because of the chinese new year they have lots of dahlias cloud forest was nice centerpiece of the forest is its waterfall this portrays a rain forest,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is incredibly gorgeous just a stunning ecosystem why the meh review then honestly the layout of the place makes it impossible to move at your own pace through it we were repeatedly trapped behind large groups of wallowing picture takers that afforded us no room to pass or move along if you are really into flowers or you are a horticulturist then perhaps you can gaze upon orchid after orchid for endless hours and be content for us we wanted to spend maybe   minutes in the cloud forest and another   in the flower dome this was incredibly challenging since the majority of the paths are pretty narrow to be fair we were there on a saturday and it was pretty busy but just be forewarned the place is pretty but pretty boring too and at least when we went mobbed by the slowest group of amoeba like tour groups i have ever been around,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,our first food experience in singapore we had a rice and chicken plate that was made in ceramic plates the food was delicious and very fresh the service was ok but we also went there right before they were closing for lunch the basmati rice was cooked slowly with the chicken broth with fresh parsley and scallions which made it so juicy they have a different variety of tea so we tried ginger lemon and lemon grass overall a good place reasonable price and good food,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,if you are a tourist in singapore it is possible to enjoy all the parts of singapore without spending much money and this is one of them you can spend only  to get the perfect skyview of singapore pinnacle at duxton mrt train your way through little india chinatown eunos malay village and walk your way through this city for little money gardens by the bay is the central park of singapore and is attached to the glitzy casinos of the marina bay sands hotel you can walk into that hotel and its fancy shops for free and this garden is also free too the garden has many parts my sister and i biked our way into this park and parked there and walked around there is an electric forest of sorts called the clouds which are these electric trees that feel mystical like some avatar scene if you are patient and wait to  or  or so you can watch an awesome light show for free you can pay some money to climb these trees and walk around the tree tops if you want there is a children is water park that even adults can run through after a hot day with showers and bathrooms near by it is fun and right next to it is the cactus gardens now if you really love flowers and orchids you can pay  to go take a look at the conservatory complex i did not go in but i have heard raving reviews of this place the cloud dome and forest are air conditioned and in doors if you are hungry there is plenty to eat in either the conservatory for to complete your fancy experience or you can take a walk to the gardens satay hawker food like place a little pricier than most hawker centers but you can get your local eats and drinks here this is a must for anyone coming to singapore it is right at marina bay sands and if you are already going to spend a day in this area may as well walk through this to get how beautiful singapore is and how much they pride their city in a forest status,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,simply spectacular garden pictures tell all free area is lovely we also visited the paid attractions amazing recommend,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,when in singapore you do three things  eat  party so you can burn calories to eat  sightseeing to build up an appetite gardens by the bay helps with one of two of those activities you can walk around a lot they have a food court its pretty similar to all the other popular food courts you will find the food is ok but i did not think it was anything special most of the outdoor areas are free you pay for the cloud forest flower dome and the skyway explore all the gardens during the day or come at night for the light show if you have a limited time i recommend coming at night for the light show and then walking over to marina sands rooftop for a nice view of the city and drinks do not come to singapore without checking out this place it is a must,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay are an incredible experience with lush greenery trees and flowers everywhere surprisingly it is also a great way to beat that balmy singapore heat because a good portion is are conditioned,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,cannot go wrong at this price frankly speaking flower dome is not very attractive the cloud forest is amazing the entire project is so fantastic with modern designs,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,the flower dome was beautiful it is also a great place to escape the singapore heat we spent about an hour here so many exotic plants from around the world this attraction is definitely worth the money highly recommend,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,absolutely stunning tourist attraction that was the main reason that i visited singapore the exhibits themselves were very fascinating but you also get a good view of marina bay sands which is also a crazy feat of engineering to enter you can buy a ticket that allows you entrance both into the cloud forest and the flower dome i came during a weekend so it was a bit crowded but there is so many different plants to see definitely recommend if you have any interest in plantlife the cloud forest walk was nice a bit scary and the indoor man made waterfall was a nice view it was raining when i visited so they did not allow people to walk along the supergrove trees which was disappointing however the light shows at night were very well prepared and it was cool to see all the people sitting in a giant crowd watching the colorful light displays with opera music playing to accompany the show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is an amazing place to visit with the cloud forest flower dome and supertree grove the supertree grove was absolutely stunning the view was beautiful i am not a fan of heights but i just had to do the ocbc skyway the view from the top was amazing it started to get windy so the skyway started swaying which freaked me out and i completely froze other than that i enjoyed the walk and scenery truly recommend doing this,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,first day in singapore and we were informed by our taxi driver while on the way to our hostel to visit the marina bay sands hotel to see the infinity pool unfortunately we did not have enough time to visit the skydeck so we ended our evening with a walk to the gardens by the bay we walked from chinatown and by the time we reached the garden the admissions gate was closed instead we walked through the garden paths and found our way to the supertree grove it was amazingly stunning with a lot of open space among the giants with the skies clear you can see the sands hotel in the distance as well as the bright lights strung around the supertree groves definitely worth the trip even though it was short,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is on most lists of what to do in singapore for good reason completely gorgeous and a great way to spend the morning,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a great location of a stroll there is very little value aded by paying for an admission best things about this place can be experienced from outside,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is an amazing botanic garden with interesting statues and art sculptures really cool supertree with a walkaround bridge spanning a few of them the cloud dome and rainforest dome are spectacular it can get quite hot during the day and even though it is a garden atmosphere there is not a lot of shade,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,least mosquitoes among all singapore parks which is a great job try hidden paths you can find lots of totally ignored and solitary beautiful places while mainstream ways are overcrowded,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,beautiful area to walk around and view a variety of flora getting here can be tricky so just follow the signs inside the shoppes at marina bay that lead you up an escalator to an elevated walkway over to the gardens,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,honestly my favorite place in singapore so far it is a lot of walking from marina bay sands involves a lot of bridges so beware if you are scared of heights like me but i think it was totally worth it the cloud forest was nothing like i have ever seen before not gonna lie it was cooler than any waterfall i have witnessed in person and the supertree groves was beautiful no beautiful is an understatement go at night to see it light up there is even a light show around  i believe and if you are stuck behind a crowd of people just find another way because i did not realize there so many empty spots until ten minutes later of just standing behind people,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,i would heard about these air conditioned gardens in singapore and i was excited to check out the flower dome we only bought the single dome pass which was  sgd i thought that was pretty reasonably priced compared to other options on a sunday morning it was not too crowded and we were able to wander easily through the different flowers and plants covering the world the gardens are kept at a very chilly temperature so be sure to bring a jacket,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,the free light show is worth the crowd and heat how can you beat  ft tall lit trees inside a botanical garden even if you skip the paid elevated walkway it is a must go for singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,yeah this place is ace the supertrees are like the weird genetic mutations from the film annihilation a little vole thing poked its head out just where i was sitting super cute little critter i am glad he has this weird mutated forest to live in i recommend going for the light show in the evening say hi to the vole for me if you see him,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,an impressive place you simply have to see it go during the day or the mosquitoes may take u away p,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,enjoyed the experience being with plants is my favourite past time would recommend going to the cloud forest as it is cool and you get to experience temperate plantsliked the way the landscaping was done together with the waterfall,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a must see attraction in singapore it is beautiful and nice to talk and unless you want to go up top or to the different buildings it is free it stays busy all day,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,my recent trip to singapore allowed me a chance to check out the gardens by the bay the greenhouses were an amazing sight to see and it was a great way to beat the heat i saw new plants and trees that i have never seen within my travels the cloud forest was a beautiful sight to behold and enjoyed walking around it the whole entire inside the greenhouses the temperature was well regulated and it was the freshest air i was breathing i could have slept the night here if allowed,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,one of my favorite places on my trip the garden is huge and there is so much to see a pity i did not get a chance to explore the whole garden the outdoor gardens are free admission is required for the flower dome cloud forest and the ocbc skyway one of the main attractions is the night show located in the supertree grove there is a different theme every month and when i went it was a musical theme as it gets dark the trees slowly lights up and at  pm or  pm for the later show the music starts and you get a fantastic light show along with it a definite must see,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,hands down our favorite spot in singapore the super trees are beyond amazing to look at during the day and are especially mesmerizing at night the light show is not to be missed and is absolutely free we went two nights in a row the gardens are super accessible via mrt but it does get super crowded right after the show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,enjoyed everything about it it is a must see place i would suggest to see in the evening during the day it is too hot,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,we went here a few days before we were due to fly back we went when it was sundown and it was absolutely an illuminating experience i kind of took off to run whilst they took their damn sweet time i went w  of my colleagues singapore is simply a beautiful country definitely worth a visit if you have a hard time relaxing and just strolling around like yours truly which was why i got antsy and took off running it was a bad idea because we lounged at clarke quay afterwards i was a sweaty ass mess you can take the mrt here no need to take a cab breathtaking what a great work trip vacation i had,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,another awesome visit here at gardens by the bay first time back in  years saw the cloud forest dome contains the world is tallest indoor waterfall the supertree light show is always epic must see if visiting singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,look i get that there is not a lot to do in singapore so they created these gardens and it is fine to walk around there and the  minute light show was worth  minutes of my time but we paid  sing to get into the cloud forest which was a complete and utter waste of money man made waterfalls and lots of plants both real and fake and absolutely nothing worth seeing my advice do the free stuff skip the pay stuff,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,if you want to have a different experience in sg do drop by gardens by the baybeen there a few times they always has a theme and so far i have enjoyed their sakura cherry blossom theme floral exhibition the most it is something that a tropical country could find without the help of the exhibition,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,looks gorgeous here after watching crazy rich asians movie i have to come visit both day and night i have never been here but i want to go plus this landmark is actually eco friendly truly a hidden gem a must visit,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,great exhibit for family and tourists definitely have to check out cloud forest and the flower garden both are the domes at the gardens they have a light show at the tall flower structures a def must watch they start the shows at  pm it is a  minute show which gives you enough time to cross the street afterwards to go to the water front to watch another light show similar to disney is world of color not as good though overall this place felt like an amusement park but for a large garden def would come back again to explore some more this place is definitely a tourist trap i came with my friends on a friday night and it was overly crowded mainly at the cloud forest and flower garden i hate crowds and the amount of people and lines definitely put me in a sour mood i would advise to come during the day to see the exhibits and to stop by at night to watch the light show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is truly a beautiful singapore attraction just strolling through the gardens alone is magical both by night and by day there are over  acres to explore with extraordinary plants flowers trees and waterways the super trees light up at night and the atmosphere transports you into a world of fantasy they are covered with a collection of exotic plants and flowers which support the environment and offer more to the ecosystem this way then just being pretty metal structures the gardens themselves are free which is nice because a little stroll through them can add a really lovely end to a evening there are other attractions in the gardens including a flower dome which i did not visit and the cloud forest the combined ticket is about   and if i would had more time i would have done both i visited the cloud forest and that is a definite must,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is a must see while in singapore and you can get discounted tickets for the cloud forest and flower dome attractions at the changi airport upon arrival gardens by the bay is a beautifully constructed garden with acres of green age besides the attractive super trees that are cool to look at during the daytime and pretty when lit up at night there are so many trees plants flowers just so much nature in the singaporean heat enjoying the outdoors can be difficult and taking photos can also be distracting but luckily the gardens extend to the indoors where there is good ac the sections of the outdoor gardens showcase different themes while the nature held indoors are showcased by species plant type the flower dome is a great for photo ops for the botanical lover but the cloud forest is also wonderful because the pathway to the very top of the waterfall is fun it is also a great spot to photograph marina bay sands i recommend visiting the indoor sections after you explore the outdoors so that you can better appreciate the ac and also visit the gardens at least once during the day and then the night make sure you wear comfy footwear because you will be walking a whole lot there is a gift shop with a lot of souvenirs including merlion statues flower stones jewelry clothing teas singaporean cooking mixes and postcards amongst other stuff definitely a place to put on your check list,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,amazing the outdoor grounds are free to wander around and you can even see the sunset light show at the supertrees the path around the water seems like a popular place for locals to run bike especially when the sun has set but paying the entry fee to go in the cloud forest any indoor exhibits going on is so worth every penny the cherry blossoms were in full bloom when we came here and it was stunning both the cloud forest the cherry blossom exhibits were huge expansive multi level air conditioned indoor expanses of thriving green and flowering plants water features and fun sculptures made of wood and and lego highly recommend,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,no trip to singapore is complete without a visit to gardens by the bay and you must visit both day and night to capture the full beauty of this place do note however it can be quite a bit of walking if you plan to go to the cloud museum etc like many places in this gorgeous place you could spend a day just taking pictures and capturing in all of the beauty,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,beautiful gardens and exhibits a great place to spend a couple hours walking around and enjoying nature,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a must see visiting singapore amazing job both domes are spectacular but if you can only do  i suggest the cloud forest very well done very educational albeit a bit sobering as we think about climate change,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,beautiful take a your breath away nights of ocular pleasure eat drink and be in harmony with your surroundings,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is even more incredible than i could have imagined it was rainy so i did not enjoy the outside space as much as i had hoped but the flower dome and cloud dome were beyond amazing i did not do a guided tour just wandered through on my own though i am sure you would learn a ton from said tours for flower dome they have a special display for the fall with more pumpkins than even americans are used to the cloud dome was incredible seeing all these plants and learning about cloud forests the number of orchids throughout both were my favorite overall i would definitely recommend even at sd,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,very touristy but worth a look if it is your first time in singapore if you are a regular then you already know what you are in for here beautiful views and a pleasant way to spend a few hours,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,ocbc skywayone of my bucket list items is to walk on the ocbc skyway and see the supertrees up close in fact i wanted to do this walk at night during the light show but our schedule did not allow after buying the  entrance tix i encouraged our group to walk up the stairs instead of taking the elevator because we are still healthy enough to do that there were no crowds on the walkway and the views all around was beautiful cloud forest conservatory domethe waterfall at the entrance is such a refreshing oasis from the heat of the equator big crowds of people at this attraction during midday we climbed up the stairs instead of herding into the elevators like cattle the walkway spirals down to multiple platforms which feature different themes towards the bottom is a movie about global warming the last stop is a large gift shop great place for visitors to see singapore,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,the concept is pretty dope if you are one of those people who loves to walk bring comfortable shoes and explore then this is the spot for you the element of surprises are explosive so ditch the phone camera and bring a real camera that can really capture your experience here be patient it is a tourist attraction meaning lots of people but it is worth it and its free,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,love it a new idea of modern life sharing space with nature the place is spacious and you can spend all day walking inside or bring food to picnic there many great views flower dome and cloud dome is a must flower dome at the time i visit has tulip theme so i can see all kind of tulip under the dome presenting in an aesthetic way what is more cloud dome is a cloud forest it makes you feel like in a fiction movie where human all extinct and the building became house of wildlife,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,flower dome was cool we went during tulip mania so it was really pretty cloud dome was alright supertree grove ocbc skyway and the light show was the best definitely a must to see at night,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,from far away gardens by the bay looks pretty grand and majestic especially if you are looking at it from the singapore flyer this place is definitely worth making the stop for due to its uniqueness and photo opportunities if you swing here at night it is quite magical to see the trees all lit up and such to get to this place you must go through marina bay sands hotel once you get through the hotel it is quite a walk to the garden itself since there is a large free park that you can wander around in before it simply follow the signs and you will eventually reach the garden when you reached the garden there are two main sections you can explored in the two domes are the cloud forest and flower area personally i find the cloud forest to be a lot more exciting than the flower area inside the cloud forest you will find various plants a huge waterfall and overall it is a pleasant walking experience in nice cool temperature that is a great relief from singapore is humidity as for the flower dome could not see too many flowers clearly at night and overall the flowers itself was not too memorable in comparison to what you would see at other bigger flower garden places i e not too many exotic colorful flowers to take pictures of perhaps visiting in december not a lot of flowers available entry fee here is a bit pricey and i would recommend getting your ticket at a visitor center like in chinatown that offers a discounted rate i think best time to go here is roughly around sunset time to capture pictures in the day time and night time as the sun goes down allow yourself at least  hours for the experience since my friends and i learned that one hour prior to closing time was not enough to leisurely wander through the different domes and take pictures do keep in mind that it could get a bit chilly in the cloud forest if you are used to the humidity warm air,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,definitely a must visit for tourists flower dome and cloud forest if i remembered correctly it was approximately   for both attractions per person the flower dome itself was amazing everywhere you turned there was beautiful flowers cacti trees plants etc everything is simply breathtaking if you have allergies i feel sorry for you lol the cloud forest had a beautiful waterfall and you get to walk high up and get an amazing view from different angles so worth it and will come back again if i get the chance in the future supertree grove you have to come at night to truly experience the spectacular free night show they have to offer it is a one in a lifetime experience this was probably my favorite of them all definitely recommend,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay was the highlight of my trip to singapore you cannot miss this place my mom and i bought tickets for cloud forest and flower dome we skipped skywalk because it was just sooo hot and i did not feel like walking much either the access to this place could be somewhat inconvenient with mrt depending on which station you are coming from you might end up taking multiple lines and detour the  tram is so worth it in my opinion you get a round trip ticket from the tram stop near the mrt station to cloud forest and flower dome both places are well air conditioned so you can cool off while you are in there flower dome had some amazing tree arts and great picture spots it just amazes me the creativity of the person who came up with this idea at night they have an illumination show on skywalk artificial trees and i recommend it over the marina bay night show it is funny to see they use the same music as the show at disneyland but nonetheless it was beautiful,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay proves that singapore is a garden country this place is massive just walking there you will see lots of plants there are two domes for gardens by the bay one of the dorms has a lot of differnt flowers you truly need to stop and smell the flowers i came at the the time the sunflowers were wilting so i think they have different flowers per season there are places for you to rest as you go up and down the dome they also have an elevator for those who need to use it to go to the different sections of the area the second dome has a waterfall and more plants the waterfall was huge and yes it was a great place to cool down when you exit both of these domes it guides you through the gift shop it is a trap i know but i still fell in the trap and bought something when you walk out there is a drop off and pick up station near the mcdonalds if you are waiting for your ride you can stay for the evening show if you want but i do not think it is worth it it also depends on the weather if it is too stormy they wo not let you up,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,wow must see an incredible park with magnificent gardens but the highlight is the cloud forest not to be missed it houses the largest indoor waterfall multi story indoor cloud forest with great flowers also there is an indoor garden that is huge showing flowers from around the world,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is pretty big and it took me several visits over the years to more or less explore the entire area maybe i still miss out on certain parts i am not sure i have walked over from the bayfront mrt station took the shuttle drove and parked and even took the guided audio tour on my visits which helped to cover the grounds the only thing i have not done is to cycle over from east coast park yet it has gotten better over the years compared to when it first opened then there was no proper lighting and signs around so it was quite a maze trying to get out of the gardens in total darkness after the garden rhapsody needless to say it took a while before i went back again when things were much improved plus there were plenty of mozzies which fed on me in the evening now it is quite easy to navigate around the gardens there are huge signs indicating directions to the mrt station the supertree grove various dining areas and to the meadow there are also plenty of lamp posts illuminating the paths at night i love both the domes flower dome and cloud forest for the simple reason they are air conditioned they offer a respite from the humidity and heat during the day plus the flowers and plants in there are beautiful sculptures can be found all over the gardens and there are special themes throughout the entire year  christmas wonderland was a beauty especially with the spiegeltent from netherlands and luminarie creating a fairytale like setting against the night sky but what made this gardens even better is the annual pass if you adore flowers and nature you may want to consider getting the annual pass which gives you unlimited entry into both domes and ocbc skyway for  days in addition you get  hours free parking and discounts at the gift shop and f b places i finally applied for the pass and have been going to the gardens i can afford to take my time to view the flowers or come back another day if it is too crowded it is definitely better to go on weekdays evening when the crowd is reduced you can also pack a picnic basket and just chill on the lawn or meadow or most of the grass area just remember to pack up and throw away your trash at the end of it there is a decent selection of cafes restaurants for the budget conscious as well as for those looking to splurge for the view get local snacks prawn crackers peas nuts and interesting flavored ice cream durian earl grey tea etc from inside the gift shop after visiting the domes tip a solid attraction for both tourists and locals take the guided audio tour if you are too tired to walk the grounds it is worth it for those who can walk whole day head over to satay by the bay the walk along the waterfront is gorgeous during sunset and kids will love the children is garden parents can chill at the cafe while children play with water check the website for information as there are monthly maintenance done at the domes and skyway so check it before heading down,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,hey no trip to singapore is complete without a trip to gardens by the bay i never knew this place has gotten so much attention in the past few months this is not your average botanic garden but it is a hangout place for both tourists and natives alike i usually come here to relax when i am having a long day counseling people gbtb is easily accessible by mrt and really worth the wait if you are not a native singaporean no trip to the area is complete without a visit to this place do not worry about the admission fee because you will get a lot more than what your money does you get great views of the singapore skyline and the marina bay sands area at one time there will be a light show which is done edc style it will be the best  minutes of your trip if you come here during a holiday there will be addition lights and areas that you can see of charge come here and have major fun,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,amazing feat of engineering and gorgeous gardens the use of solar power makes it that much better thoroughly enjoyed the gardens,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,beautiful place to walk around and just inhale the clean and fresh air the weather was humid but my husband and i managed to stay indoors mostly because the place offers different exhibitions to enter definitely worth the visit it wo not disappoint,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,amazing a must do when one is here pay to see the two conservatories the flower dome and the cloud forest beautiful lazy to walk pay sgd for a return shuttle totally worth it especially if you are traveling with toddlers,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,how is this rated any less than  stars gardens by the bay is just beautiful and amazing it is like walking right onto the movie set of avatar i could have wandered for hours well i guess i actually did wander for a very long time there is so much to see what with all the exhibits and gardens one of my friends had recommended cloud forest dome but the supertrees were my absolute favorite if you have the time i would definitely recommend a tour singapore you are truly a magical place,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,nice and relaxing pace to as adventure and take giorgio is photo everywhere you look there a place to take photo so clean and beautiful place to walk it can be near the water or grass so many things to see and explore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this was highly recommended as a must do thing in singapore and it certainly did not disappoint the cloud forest was really cool especially if you are there for the misting be prepared though that the walk way is really high and part of it is a grated and see through got caught up in the excitement and rushed out the elevator onto the walkway and almost right into a panic attack when i saw how high it was the flower dome was really great and had a great variety of plants and trees my favorite part was super tree grove and staying for the light show at night a definite must on your trip here,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,omg this place is one of the most beautiful places on the planet i have been lucky enough to have traveled to almost every country that i ever wanted to go to and singapore did not disappoint anyways the main attraction here are the trees however there is so much more to see here first of all there are two shows at night at the first one starts at   and the second one starts around p m i think although this place is huge it is best to come there in the afternoon around   p m depending on how much you enjoy looking at plants there are two large air condition domes in the park filled with plants cactus flowers trees and other plant life from all over the world i have never seen plants or trees anywhere like the ones i have seen there be sure to bring a fully charged camera and a fully charged cell phone and tablet as you will want to take lots of pics it would be a good idea to bring one of those portable battery chargers for phones and tablets with you oh and an extra chip for your camera might be a good idea too if you use a digital camera i filled up my chip quickly then the battery died so i had to use my phone there are also lots of cool looking wooden animal sculptures all over the place i liked the dragon one the best i forgot how much tickets are but they are not super expensive also you can go up in the trees for an incredible view you can get tickets by the trees there are a few different themed gardens like the chinese garden as well as a few others around the area i missed seeing those as i did not realize they were there until later we did see a large man made lake there though there is also a large indoor waterfall inside one of the domes and a few small ones anyways definitely try to arrive to the show early to get a good seat music is synchronized to the lights and the show is one of the most amazing things that i have ever seen in my life try leaving early to as getting a taxi after the show is over will be hard youtube com watch v ppkr also a lot of the main attractions in singapore are located around this area such as the merlion the observation wheel and a bunch of other places so i strongly suggest that you try to book a hotel around this area when you visit singapore as a tourist,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,after checking out the views at level i decided to check out the lights here they were very pretty yet i wanted to see more seeing the bright colors always makes me happy,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is a huge nature park in central singapore the park consists of three waterfront gardens bay south garden bay east garden and bay central garden conservatory complex are just speechless one is the flower dome and the other is the cloud forest the flower dome is the worlds largest columnless glasshouse cloud forest has cloud mountain its meters talk mountain accessible by an elevator and visitors will be able to descend the mountain via a circular path where a waterfall is it took the whole day to enjoy the whole park and one of my best memories from singapore came from super tree grove which is located at bay south garden supertrees are tree like structures the supertrees are covered and surrounded with unique and exotic ferns vines tropical flowers and orchids they are one of the iconic structures in the park its a large canopy in the day to provide shade and it comes to life at night with a beautiful light show at night they do light show at supporter grove its so beautiful i wanted to spend more time there its free entrance for light show but i can say it was a life time experience you can take one day to visit the flower dome and cloud forest enjoy supporter grove at night must go place if you are traveling to singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is absolutely stunning i highly recommend coming here at night too to see it in the dark all the lights are lit up and look so beautiful every night there is a water light show next to the main louis vuitton store which i highly recommend watching,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is a pleasant stroll a lovely break from the singapore heat here in the evenings we parked at the marina barrage carpark then walked down a path by the marina bay waterfront to the shoppes for dinner with a little detour into the gardens you will pass by cyclists joggers and people on their e scooters there are great views of the bay supertrees the singapore flyer and marina bay sands along the way even the geckos seem to enjoy the scenery,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is just amazing i am not sure what else can be said about it tickets can be bought via many different apps and websites which will give you a discount over  at least which i would suggest before you get there i think it is  at the window i bought mine online for  right there i went about pm knowing i wanted to be there as it turned into night at  the super trees perform a wonderful light show set to music the show was set to show tunes when i was there i loved it it is a must do in singapore i would visit here again and again,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is not an outdoor experience so no matter how hot is is this is an enjoyable way to spend time in singapore i think   a day is enough there two main exhibits are the flower dome and the cloud forest indoor rain forest when you enter the cloud forest there is a beautiful waterfall that is perfect for selfies you take an elevator up to the top and can walk through the rain forest of steel footpaths there are tremendous view of the entire marina bay area the flower dome was a gigantic indoor flower garden sectioned off by indigenous flowers found from all over the world oddly there is a lot of music memorabilia and s american rock n roll playing but it is an interesting addition to the experience there are other things to do in the park but these two attractions are the main reason to go,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this gorgeous man made wonder located behind the iconic marina bay sands hotel is a must visit especially for first timers i am not normally a huge fan of botany yet this place provided such magical and wondrous journey of nature intermixed with modern design and architecture that it ended up being one of the highlights of our singapore trip this place which is easily accessible from the hotel is not cheap but really worth the admission fee for the hours you can spend exploring all the range of plants and flowers and for the cool relief from the typical humid and hot singapore weather would highly recommend,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,one of the greatest places in singapore enjoy the beautiful lighting at dusk you will love it,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is amazing with the insane maroon colour tall trees there is also a large curled platform about  meters above the ground and you can climb up in a tree to reach the platform and the view is amazing the light show is incredible too each night the trees have lights on them that flash fade and light up to different songs and it is a spectacle not to miss,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,tried to come here when it was not too hot it was really nice we missed the light show in the evening because we needed to head home early but saw some glimpse and it was actually worth watching,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,definitely one of the places to stroll and check out during the day or the evening in singapore the tall super trees are definitely stunning specially with night lighting the two domes with tropical vegetation and flowers are also part of the things to see completely re done and mastered garden it is still a great showcase of singaporian make it nice art,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,with my mom visiting it is only fair that i bring her to gardens by the bay we have both been here before but we wanted to visit during night time as the garden rhapsody light show is happening now til  june  it is free to the public though i do not come here often i noticed how lush the supertree grove has become when i first visited almost  years ago wow the tree trunks were bare now all the plants have blossomed and it is a really gorgeous site walking around i also noticed some nice smelling flowers everything is just in full bloom and it was lovely i really enjoyed walking around at night versus daytime because it is a lot cooler and the lights are pretty sweet hope you have a good camera that can take great night time shots because there are tons a great photo opps here,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is a must see if in singapore massive garden park and inside it it has the world is largest green house i know it does not sound crazy interesting but it really is also they have artwork throughout the park they even have a cool alice in wonderland exibit,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,anyone travelling to singapore must visit gardens by the bay as this visionary place showcases a stunning array of exotic flowers from cherry blossoms to tulips imported from japan and holland respectively i love the beautiful waterfall as well as the view of marina bay sands hotel which you can see from the top and the entire dome just feels surreal as if you are in a futuristic forest,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is amazing definitely the highlight of my trip to singapore the outer gardens are free you just have to pay to enter the flower dome and the cloud forest it is worth it but also worth just walking around the free areas if you are on a tight budget it was around  usd with a voucher from klook,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,my visit to the gardens by the bay was purely to tick it off a list hence i definitely was not expecting to enjoy it as much as i did this artificial sky garden is visually stunning sadly that was all to it only one of the trees provides access to the top via the indochine restaurant which charges you a price inclusive of a drink nothing special about the place itself but the view is fantastic arguably you can get the same at a rooftop bar with a more exciting drinks menu the best part ended up being the free gardens which has so many different parts to explore everything has been meticulously maintained and little information boards add another layer to the experience we ended up staying until the lights show which was rather underwhelming however walking down the lake at night was quite magical flanked on one side by skyscrapers and on the other by an explosion of flora this oasis in the middle of a bustling city will certainly give you the much needed relaxation you need,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,there is something to be said about the thousand year old huge trees they have successfully moved into the bio domes a lot of care and attention went into shipping huge trees from around the world and they are blooming and healthy i spent all day here roaming around both the flower dome and cloud forest plus the numerous outdoor gardens plenty to see and experience plus very easy to get to via the mrt well worth the visit when in singapore there are literally hundreds of thousands of flowering plants trees and bushes from across the world here very well done,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,what a nice respite from the singapore heat i enjoyed the gardens and saw many interesting plants i had never seen before my only complaint would be the price but i am used to dc where everything including the amazing botanical domes is free,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,one of the most memorable places i ever visited amazing went there initially to pass an hour or two and  hours later was just leaving super interesting and the layout is really cool literally,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,brilliantly designed well thought out and executed park i loved the cloud forest dome more than the flower dome and the outdoor skywalk this is a perfect place to walk off some jet lag if you are flying in from the other side of the globe you get lots of sun when and where you want to outside and you cool down in both of the domes if you are lucky enough to stay at the marina bay sands hotel you will have the treat of seeing the trees because they are artificial light up on weekends starting around pm,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is a nice place to walk around if it is not too hot humid outside i came during the day and wanted to walk from the entrance to see the cloud dome but it was too humid hot outside and i turned back before i made it i also came back once at night and it is cool to see the supergrove lit up,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this was a very pleasant place to visit the flower dome and cloud forest were a lovely way to see some beautiful plant displays while escaping the crazy heat outside you will laugh when you see people start putting on coats because it is too cold those crazy singaporeans if you are feeling tired be sure to spring for the extra cost to be driven to and from the domes in a tram it was totally worth it in the heat of the day the flower dome not only had some pretty fantastic gardens but they had super cool driftwood type sculptures all over there were a trio of horses galloping among the plants a looming giant dragon a family of primates mountain goats climbing up the foliage and so on they really did it well the cloud forest is really different but still just as nice it boasts plants that thrive on a moist somewhat cool environment like a real cloud forest the first thing you see and hear is a thundering waterfall that sprays a ton of extra mist around the dome there are multiple levels to this place and they direct you through it skillfully so you do not even quite realize you are following a prescribed path until you see that all traffic flows in one direction we really enjoyed this unique attraction,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,meh i liked the botanical gardens and the southern ridge walk better maybe more fun if you are with a gang i was feeling a bit grumpy that day which was not anyone is fault including the gardens but two stars is an honest review of my experience on the day,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,spectacular nature park in the smack dab middle of singapore it is part of an effort by the government to increase the quality of life by creating more greenery in the city the flower dome is the largest glasshouse without columns in the world my favorite development is the supertree grove in the bay south garden these trees act like vertical gardens for various exotic plants harness solar energy to light up at night and collect rainwater for irrigating the fountains it is such a beautiful sight especially at night which is when i came for a visit what is really awesome about singapore is the high level of safety you can stroll under a highway overpass in the middle of the night and meander through the park without any worry as a tourist you should definitely make your way to see this national icon,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a spectacular place by all accounts there is a lot of grandeur to this modern spot in singapore mush of it is plastic and staged but it is still quite grand and a beautiful spot to walk around and unwind the deck is magnificent and has a spectacular view,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i am a fan gardens by the bay almost looks strange and from the future but the technology and the idea behind it is quite amazing personally i do not really enjoy looking at flowers and plants but i was blown away by the flower dome it is one of those places you have to see to believe and it is hard to explain its glory until you have seen it cloud forest was another favorite attraction of mine to be that high up surrounded by greens in the middle of a city was amazing of course you cannot miss the massive supertrees too,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a must visit while you are in singapore we missed the light show but still enjoyed this park walking around and taking pictures here is free if you want to enter the gardens then you have to pay,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i ended up buying an annual pass in the middle of my visit which was even before the supertree grove wonder so need i say more gardens by the bay is awesome and a must do for both locals and tourists i love strolling in a nice garden but i have difficulties coping with the blistering heat well the flower dome is a botanic garden on speed sans the singaporean weather just the flower dome was sufficient for me to buy the annual pass the flower arrangements are amazing and the fact that it feels cool and refreshing is a plus not special enough go to the cloud forest and be amazed by waterfall at the entrance and take an dazzling stroll on the sky bridges which cool you even further down so do take a sweater still not impressed watch the supertree grove show admittedly this has a bit of a disney world vibe to it but who does not love disney world after sunset need some more convincing well maybe this one is not for you then but for those who are already amazed take some time to read up the facts and figures on the different info boards but also the internet did you know it costs approx  million to operate this park annually yes i am a fanyes i will return,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is an absolutely gorgeous part of singapore and one of my favorite attractions the flower dome is nice to walk around and see all the different types of flowers but the cloud forest is an even neater experience in my opinion it is beautiful it offers lots of interesting scientific information about the different flowers wildlife and vegetation of the different levels as you rise in altitude the indoor waterfall is refreshing and a lot of fun for children the supertrees while pretty cool during the day offer a spectacular and unique light show set to music at night it is a great place to go for a stroll on a date or just escape the bustle of the city it is also a wonderful place for a photo op and i have seen multiple couples have their wedding photos done there,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,you have to see this to believe the lights and music sound show are like the fountains at the bellagio,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,lovely place to have a walk even if the heat can be discouraging and the two conservatories absolutely deserve a visit,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,seriously stunning just an amazing place a must see if you are in singapore never saw so many types of orchids ever before and the whole place is landscaped and done so well awe inspiring there is nothing better than being with nature also great flow to the gardens as well as informational signage throughout,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this park is a work of art in its conceptualization and layout unfortunately though the attractions within the park are overpriced and not worth it compared to other alternatives the cloud flower domes were not worth the price imho the cloud dome was more interesting of the two if that helps i actually preferred the jungle more southeast east of them where the apiary and exotic birds are btw the outdoor skywalk is not worth it just a warning the gift store was full of heavily overpriced merchandise and pushy salespeople there were very nice things but  of the stuff in there i felt i needed to haggle over put on your walking shoes because the foot travel here almost reaches disneyland territory i also recommend an umbrella because most of the time it is either rainy or super sunny i went to the botanic gardens during my trip and found that to be more interesting than the domes or skywalk i actually recommend both gbtb and bg though because they are distinct enough,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,arrived late afternoon to singapore from bali and i decided to explore the gardens at night no entrance fee in most areas so you can freely explore the grounds and see the venue light up you will be greeted by these huge flower domes near the entrance with the view of the marina bay sands hotel as the backdrop i would recommend going up the sky walk for some stunning city views and city lights the entrance fee to this part of the park is only  sgd i only waited about twenty minutes in line which i did not mind while in line i was also able to catch the nightly light show the flower domes gives a light show performance which syncs to music of all kinds it was a bit cheesy and nice at the same time from the top of the sky walk you will be able to capture and see the beauty of singapore the skyline views were amazing i kinda wish i did the same thing during the day once through you can also visit different parts of the gardens do not forget to also check out the souvenir shops it is on the pricey side but i was able to find some nice souvenirs i just could not say no to lol cabs are also readily available on site,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,surprisingly fun futuristic attraction highlights huge enclosed gardens in interesting domes futuristic feel of fabricated environments waterfall and sky walks tall light up flowers in the middle view from dome to sands hotel and ferris wheel cheesy photo upon entering the flower dome to add to my attractions collection midlights flower dome did not find it as exciting as the other and some areas did not have muchlowlights playground closed mondays it looked so cool and my lil guy would have loved it big water area too have to pay for each dome separately was not thinking much about visiting here but it was nice and worth the stop,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the cool futuristic design of gardens by the bay is not to be missed you could spend a few hours or a whole day here but given my limited time in singapore i only spent about an hour walking around the free heritage outdoor gardens at night gardens by the bay has four major attractions the two conservatory domes admission required the ocbc skyway admission required the heritage outdoor gardens free and the children is play area garden free at first glance the supertree grove is probably the best aspect to gardens by the bay the flowers and plants growing along the trunks are beautiful and these manmade trees have photovoltaic cells harvesting solar energy from the canopy the ocbc skyway aerial walkway would be fun if you are not afraid of heights providing a different view of the gardens even if you miss last call for entry onto the ocbc skyway or into the two conservatory domes the heritage gardens are open until am and well worth a visit even late in the evening,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,on my second visit to singapore i made sure to drag my fiance to the gardens pay the extra money to climb into the super trees and walk on the bridge between them i am terrified of heights and pretty much shake and cling to the railing up there but it was totally worth it the open hours are from  am to  am you cannot go on the sky walk that entire time but it is a world of difference coming here at night vs day nighttime the super trees remind me of a james cameron movie everything is lit up in tropical colors and looks amazing on my previous visit i did not go into the cloud forest or the flower dome and i am not sure why this visit we made a day of it arriving early to climb the super trees and then go through the domes hold the phone because i did not know they were air conditioned walking into the cloud forest and being hit with a blast of cold a c was lovely after sweating it out walking around the trees i was so impressed by the cloud dome it was gorgeous we easily spent  hours walking around and taking photos of all the greenery the flower dome has rotating is hows i guess you would call them the one going on most recently was a child is nursery theme it was beautiful but they had nursery music piping through all the speakers even in the areas not dedicated to the installation after about  minutes of that i was ready to claw my ears off it was obnoxious at best the cloud dome was far superior to the flower dome in my opinion but that may vary depending on the current installation i cannot say enough good things about this place the architecture is amazing the flowers and greenery are beautiful the whole place is self sustaining it is really worth the money for admission to the domes do not skip it if you are afraid of heights still go up on the sky walk it is breath taking i will be back every visit to singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,my son and i visited gardens by the bay when we visited singapore recently and we both agreed that it was thoroughly enjoyable esp the light and sound show was super keep up the good work singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is a lovely park to walk around if you can stand the heat that is it is a huge complex and it is free entrance apart from the elevator fee to go walking on the suspended bridge between the artificial tree there were not many people here when we were here but maybe because it was scorching hot in the afternoon as it is always in singapore do go up to the suspended bridge if you dare but be careful when you have height phobia like i did i could hardly look down and had to hurry along the way could not enjoy the view as i should p,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,what a beautiful place it was great to tour the cloud forest what an engineering and biotanical feat i would come here every time i am in singaport props to durka at the information desk for her great service when i cut myself running around the park she was exceptional,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,beautiful botanic place a must visit with the family place is so big definitely plan a day to soak in all the exotic plans and artistic design,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,hm so another singapore review where i am debating between  and  stars some parts of the gardens were truly spectacular rainforest garden and the magical purple trees at the fore front where as others had good stuff but confusing pathways that directed us to the exit twice before we had completed looking around looking at you here flower dome but maybe that was a sign in itself also the christmas light show was not that spectacular it could not hold a candle to the dancing magical fountain show in barcelona but i did like the artificial trees that were created to resemble a truly spectacular sci fi sort of tree the two main gripes my mother and i had was to do with was  signage this could have been so much better frankly whats the point of having beautiful gardens plants if you cannot find them case in point at the flower dome where we wanted to check out the succulent and cactus garden and could not find out how to get to that area somehow we ended up taking the wrong turn twice and found our selves at the exit and had to back track when we finally did end up at the succulents they were worth it but still so much grief to get there and i dont think i am that directionally challenged also for the flower dome i would truly recommend skipping this place in december there were a limited number of flowers which makes sense when you think about it as was winter and so no exactly flower growing season and it was all christmas stuff and a children expo instead  crappy audio tour save your lack of reasonable tours available all together c mon again you have such beautiful views and plants and the cheapest tour they offer is  hour for  bucks really i am super glad we also went to chinatown and got tickets to both places flower dome rainforest garden for  bucks versus  at the gardens itself so that would be my big tip if you plan to visit here the only restriction to this ticket is that you have to visit both places on the same day so plan accordingly,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,beautiful and creative venue with views of the water and lots of upscale shopping nearby you can do a morning run early to beat the crowd then come again at night when the trees are lit up and there is a not to be missed dancing water fountain show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is a beautiful garden you walk around looking at the different things they have to offer and day time walking and night time walking has different things to offer at night things light up and they just look beautiful a family friendly park garden where you can learn lots,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,great place for a leisurely day with the kids start with the supertrees one can get to the top of one where you can walk along a sky bridge with views of the surrounding areas next go to the flower dome which is cool with plenty of flower displays and at this time of the year christmas themes break for lunch at one of the many restaurants and snack bars our final area we visited was the cloud forest waterfalls and a lift to the th floor were there are walkways in the sky great place for photography too,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is really a nice place to spend your evening i went here to just see the light show and it is one of its kind experiences i was awed with the combo of artificial and natural life,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is a beautiful garden and very informative rainforest in a small city try watching the lights at night as it is very pretty,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,must do is the cloud dome and the skygrove cloud dome is  per person pretty hefty but pretty and cool inside a lot of picture worthy moments skygrove is  to go up the walkway but i do not think it is worth it the view down below is better and free highly recommend the shuttle unlimited rides and do not have to walk so much in the humid weather recommend coming back to view the skygrove again at nighttime as it lights up and there is a light show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,awesome experience clocked about   steps in both domes and slept through the light show at the super trees,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the cloud dome was very good it simulated a rainforest environment with mist and fauna lot of walking on walkways winding around the dome the flower dome was a waste as there were not much flowers but the dome was done up in a christmas village theme the separate christmas exhibit with the light show at  pm with christmas music was ok but nothing special the whole experience was not a must do,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,what a sight amazing in day and fabulously lit up at night free to see from ground level pay to go up these trees you will have to also pay for cloud forest flower dome,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,one of the biggest indoor climated garden in the world it is is a very huge garden area between outdoor and indoor domes you can take the bridge directly from marina bay sands the only negative thing is the food offering there is some restaurants but not that great quality,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,we stopped by the gardens by the bay during the afternoon and stayed for the light show at night although the gardens are free there are two indoor sections that require a ticket about  usd per person since it was hot and humid out we went ahead and bought tickets to the indoor sections flower dome think of the biggest greenhouse that you could have dreamt about and that would describe the flower dome as mentioned above it was nice and cool in here when you are not looking at the flowers inside just look outside or above at the iconic singapore skyline cloud forest this indoor area is dominated by a huge six story structure that looks like a giant tree house with a waterfall when you go all the way to the top you start to walk down the structure what i did not know a little scared of heights is that you walk down via metal platforms suspended seemingly in the air needless to say we stayed in the middle part of the path the sides of the path had metal grates so you literally feel like nothing but air is beneath your feet one thing that you should do which is free is stay for the light show at the super trees at night the light display lasts around  minutes and it is a nice way to end your visit at the gardens,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,omg i love this place it is amaze balls it is so beautiful and even educational it is a well rounded attraction and if you are lucky like me you might even have some chinese students approach you to ask if you can be in a photo with them totally random they must ask all the good looking guys they see it is also very cool inside allow  hrs for the visit hereonce a month  of the  domes is closed for maintenance and they are alternating so make sure you check your dates before you go,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,quite impressed on our night visit to watch the super tree  light show shows twice every night entry from marina sands mrt side across the walkway is more crowded than entry from opposite side by car taxi and bus electronic metal lighted trees have photovoltaic tops which also capture rain water to feed the plants at the garden level light and sound show features broadway tunes nothing disney although similar in presentation to disney night shows duration is  minutes view of the singapore flyer which is also lit up at night in the distance,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a must see a truly thought out indoor outdoor garden break down about ticketing can be a little confusing soooo the outdoor gardens are free we all like free and they are pretty amazing it is fairly large and almost like a maze of how to get around the skywalk always you the opportunity to walk around on the top part of the man made trees do you need to pay extra to see these trees no only if you want to walk up above the ground it is a  dollar charge the  main indoor gardens have admission fees for both of them it is  there both worth seeing but save the cloud forest dome for last enjoy walking around and as the the plants change the smells eve change,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,great site in singapore easily spend a day here if you feel like it it would not get boring can cover most of the site in a lot less if you are committed definitely check out the supertree grove and the two domes good photo opportunities in on both both worth your time and the ish cover fee stay until pm for the light show at the supertree grove though we felt the whole thing dragged on and took too long great place to come back again and again would recommend,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is a must visit attraction in singapore i came here earlier this month and happened to pick a day that was raining cats and dogs along with thunderstorms bad luck on my part i waited at the ticket office purchased the ticket for the  dome for over an hour and finally the rain started to die down i had the option to take the shuttle cart to the garden but decided to walk there the flower dome and the cloud forest dome are both amazing by their own way but if i only have time to go to one definitely would choose the cloud dome the purple color illuminated the giant waterfall at each level there were amazing view of the dome and plants along with various exhibits and short movie to keep me entertain at night there are also light show where all the groves would light up along to the music and sound which is an amazing experience there is also the option to walk along the skywalk but since there was thunder they deemed it unsafe so it was closed the entire night,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,such a unique and beautiful place to visit i came near the christmas holidays which actually happens to be a great time to visit there were holiday music playing street lights hanging on and in between the trees and an overall wonderful and nostalgic christmas y feel children and adults alike will enjoy this place i recommend coming at night the trees decked in colored lights make quite a display the crowd is not so overwhelming my friend and i came around  pm after the  p light show and it was a comfortable  min walk to the gardens note there is only one elevator going up and down so the ride in the lift is not very comfortable but it is short just one floor up down very conveniently located from the dragonfly trail there is a bridge that leads to the marina bay sands shoppes and then to the light show behind mbs showings  pm  pm or  pm i would schedule an entire night to explore the gardens and nearby mbs area the night view and skyline are very beautiful and most of these things are not expensive or entirely free there are also small cafes and shops in the gardens such a warm and inviting environment people walking around taking pictures soft music playing in the background bright and beautiful lights strung about everywhere if i had more time i would have stayed in the garden just to really absorb everything this place was one of the highlights during my singapore trip highly recommended,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,want to give a shout out to the folks who created van gogh is theme with tulips we were very impressed i am revisiting this review of mine because i started looking at the pictures of my recent visit to singapore this ginormous horticultural beauty is a destination all on its own i will not be surprised if this botanical and architectural phenomenon gets awards from a wide range of appreciated features i have only one word to describe note that it is not used lightly wow,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,one of the favourite garden in singpaore good place if you want to walk a lot best time to visit is dusk giant man made world class structures dooms are little expensive,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the tulipmania exhibit was so pretty and nice the fairytale was a brilliant idea it was very cold inside the dome so bring a light jacket if you plan to visit money well spent  for  domes i did not go around the waterfalls dome just took picture and we left for me the main attraction were the tulips,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,so disappointed our family of  came here and wasted our money we went to the flower dome wish we went to the other forest dome instead there were not much flowers here i guess it didnt exceed my expectations as we mainly saw cactus and poinsettas we went on new years day the decorations for christmas looked cheap its a long walk from the front entrance to back entrance then you will have to make your way around the front again afterwards however the outside area is free and beautiful especially at night since it lights up very avatar like,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,incredible park and fun scutivites to do great walking along park and watching family is just have fun and tourist,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,exploring this area and a show at the magical trees was one of the most amazing experiences i have ever had the whole area from both sides of the bridge is beautiful and has a theatrical experience to it all the lights and music are synced to create an otherworldly experience i felt like i was in the movie avatar this is a must see while in singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,in the past two weeks i have visited this place a total of  times and i highly encourage all to visit this place from now until january while the christmas decorations are still up the team there did an excellent job to create the ambiance that turns the gardens into a small village filled with everything x mas my favorite includes sitting under the supertrees and watching the light shows at   and   the lights are coordinated to the christmas songs another favorite is the snow that falls down at every hour after  pm do not quote me on this do check the time on the official site i love watching kids and adults smiling and laughing while trying to catch the is now and take photos while the food selections are plenty most are on the high side,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a lot of money has been spent to make these gardens what they are totally worth checking them out,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,you should see your faces i remember that quote from avatar as i think about the first time seeing the gardens in person a quick walk from the shoppes at mbs we enjoyed the gardens at night so we could see the trees light up with them in front of you it is hard to believe the size of them at times and thinking about the effort and planning to construct the gardens this place reminded me of new york is own botanical gardens as they too were a beautiful escape from the concrete and steel of the city just like many other things in singapore is was another exciting place to see with my own eyes the view from the marina bay sands when the gardens are lit up along with the flyer are truly something to see must see gives you that feeling of being a kid again where you cannot help but just smile,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,magical all around no matter where you walk around the views are spectacular definitely worth checking out if i am singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,one word beautiful the temperature here is just perfect what is even better christmas decorations that goes all out i love the vibe here it smells good and fresh in here too the cloud forest is just crazy amazing with a giant waterfall at the entrance the flower dome is so pretty especially with the christmas decorations definitely give the ocbc sky walk a try and since i was there during the christmas season there are stalls and choirs there during the evening people are just everywhere and there are activities there for you only thing is that the crowd is crazy here and taking picture is quite a hassle otherwise it is a perfect place to go to especially for tourists,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i could not have asked for a more magical nighttime experience i came to gardens by the bay with a new friend after hearing so many good things about it from others on this cool evening we sat below the trees and just talked as hours passed by the sparkling lights were such a treat to see not many views are able to take my breath away but this one surely did it for me as an environmentalist i was happy to discover that these man made trees harness solar energy to power themselves in the evenings there is a walkway that requires payment i believe to walk across to see the view from higher up but i recommend that you spend your time on ground level and walk around on an unguided path find the little lake and enjoy the reflection of the lights in the water enjoy how the marina bay sands hotel enhances the foreground and breathe in the fresh air next to the palm trees note about bathrooms i was desperate to make a trip and thankfully i found a public bathroom in the building that sits right behind the solar supertrees singapore never lets me down parting words definitely go at night for the best possible experience it is just a walk away from mrt,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i went to gardens by the bay as my first toursity thing when my friends came and visited we went during the day to the taller inclosed section the name of it is skipping my mind right now anywho it was fun and i know i have seen it during the night while i was at mbs but i wish i was able to go there during the christmas time as the lighting looked fantastic,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is a beautiful place to visit even if you are not a big garden fan the garden is only a short walk from marina bay sand so you can visit both place within a day if u cannot stand the heat then i recommend that you go early in the day or later in the evening although most of the garden is better enjoyed during the day you can plan your day by cooling in the two conservatories which are right by each other however you do have to pay to get in i visited both the flower dome and the cloud dome my main interest was the flower dome but i was surprise to be blown away by the cloud dome with this huge waterfall it was a different world when i walk in to the cloud dome the main highlight of garden by the bay has to be the super tree you can pay to walk at the top of the walk way but if you are scared of height then you might just want to consider twice alternatively you can pay to have a drink at the restaurant in the super tree there is a balcony bit in the restaurant where you can sit outside and enjoy a drink fixed time of the evening there is a symphony music performance with these super trees so you can visit majority of the garden during the day go to marina bay sand for shopping or food and then return back to the garden in the evening to enjoy the performance and see a different view of the trees,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,probably my second favorite spot in singapore proper the first spot goes to the national orchid garden i could spend the whole day here there is so much to see it is such a beautiful place to wander around and get lost and enjoy some green amidst a bustling city you could walk through the garden outside for free of course you have to check out the supertree grove and there are also several other attractions within the gardens for a nominal fee not to mention the grove structures are so unique there is also a little light show that goes on everyday i believe at  pm and  pm must see attraction if you are in singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,we were there in december  during their holiday lights showings it was pretty crowded making the overhead walk wait a bit much the sound show was fun and well done if you are in singapore during the holidays this is a fun nighttime event,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i am so glad i came to see this i checked out pretty much everything except the glass buildings it was not out and there were a lot of lined to get into the air conditioned building this is an amazing place to see so many different species of plants i really enjoyed the walk above everyone which only cost  to get on all in all come visit this place,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this review is based on my first visit to gardens by the bay this was yesterday there were a lot of people at gardens simply because it was a public holiday i said there were a lot of people but it certainly was not crowded gardens is well planned and laid out thoughtfully i did not get the feeling that it was crowded even though there were visitors aplenty the grounds of the garden are open to the public and are free to visit the grounds are right on the banks of marina bay and you can take a leisurely stroll through the grounds within the grounds there are some paid attractions namely the ocbc skywalk which is an aerial walkway connecting  of the numerous super trees on the grounds the cloud dome and the flower dome i highly recommend visiting the domes if this will be your only visit to the gardens both domes are climate controlled to provide a very comfortable visit the exhibits are impressive and thoughtfully laid out to provide for a relaxing and edifying experience you come away with a special appreciation and love for plants there is ample parking there are  main parking areas meadow carpark basement carpark at the main entrance and satay by the bay carpark pick one depending on where you intend to start and end your visit bayfront is the closest mrt station if visiting marina bay sands you can opt to walk over to gardens via the bridge that passes under the ecp from the art science museum or over the ecp on the lions bridge if coming from the convention center gardensbythebay com sg e has all the detailed information you might need to help you get to gardens smoothly,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,this was by far my most favvorriiteee thing to do during my trip to singapore i could spend literally all day and night here pretending to be alice and wonderland meandering through the displays at sunrise staying cool in cloud forest and flower dome during the day crashing the kids splash area for a cool down and strolling back outside to catch the sunset and watch all the outdoor displays light up do not forget to swing by satay by the bay also for some great hawker center street food the best in the world drooling over my keyboard for some cereal prawn now we are not huge botanical garden fanatics but wow i dare you to find someone who does not find this place short of spectacular it really is all that what is also neat is that they have an interactive display that shows you how the architecture and design for the gardens are not only innovative but built also for ultimate functionality there are several environmental and ecological efficiency elements integrated throughout the entire park it is so cool evidently the gardens are open until  or am single female traveler no problem you are in the safest place in the world you will be just fine,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,one of the main attractions in singapore definitely one of a kind in the world with impressive artificial water fall and plantations if you are in singapore its worth a visit although the tickets to go inside the flower dome and clouds are quite expensive if you are budget traveler you can always just stay outside the domes to take some photos with the super trees and the gardens there is also a scheduled lights show with music by the super trees every night which is free and worth watching,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,feels like a very forced landmark to attract tourists however it was nice to lie down for an hour and enjoy the flashing lights of the supertrees,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,spectacular and an absolute must for everyone visiting singapore huge very well organized and maintained garden system with spectacular plants plan to spend at least a few hours here,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,great place loved it used to live in singapore and went there couple of times its really beautiful at night its free if you stay down or very little to walk up to see marina bay sands hotel,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,amazing place that is a candy feast for the eyes there is so much to see and do if you fancy a run this place is ideal for a quick few miles allow enough time to enjoy all this place has to offer one of the better places singapore to enjoy,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the most awesome public park i have seen of any major metropolitan city singapore made a statement about the country is emphasis on nature and conservation through this park my husband and i came here twice first during the day to see and take photos and second at night to enjoy the light show at pm everything we did here was free by avoided the priced entrance fees to certain attractions you can definitely enjoy the gardens without spending very much at all eat at satay by the bay,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,such a fantastic outdoor space the cloud forest is unbelievable at times it is part jurrassic park and others it is avatar the one with blue people not aang although i do love aang back to the flowers the flower dome is a touch less impressive but it is still beautiful and there is an amazing wood carved dragon to haunt your dreams a huge part of the gardens are free but it is absolutely worthwhile to buy the combo ticket for both domes it was sgd  for one dome when i went and sgd  for both in conjunction with the singapore flower show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is absolutely amazing the light show is a must watch also you do not have to pay the entry fees to watch it cloud forest and flower dome both have entry fees cloud forest was beautiful at  pm they have mist show which can be seen from anywhere inside the cloud forest mist makes the cloud forest look like a magical place it is so cool inside the cloud forest that you forget about the hot and humid weather of singapore flower dome is pretty as well but it is something that could be skipped if you do not want to spend extra bucks or due to time constraint,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,absolutely worth the time if you have more than  hours in singapore a short taxi ride away and you are whisked to a a green oasis that is both beautiful and educational oh and not to mention cool a great respite from the heat pay a visit to cloud forest and you will have goosebumps in no time so cold is the interior i especially loved the educational aspects here and their commitment to environmentally sustainable practices singapore really does seem to have itself together when it comes to looking after their resources for future generations,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,what an incredible park garden observatory and adventure i thought i was in a movie while walking through the gardens by the bay we did not get to tour the whole park just by where the futuristic flower like pillars are which was  ss to go up worth it and that was the only part we had to pay for i am sure farther into the park there was more things or see and tours to buy although you can get a pretty good view on things just walking in a few hundred meters we also stayed at marina bay sands and had the view of the gardens by the bay which at night lit up to be a spectacular light show so breathtaking,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,i would say if you were in the area of marina bay sands or staying in the hotel and you were too lazy to venture out too far from this immediate location then def check this place out the place is nice and scenic not sure if it is totally relaxing due to the proximity to the highway and the big avatar like weirdo tree structure that you have to pay to go to btw in the middle of the park is appealing in a odd way but otherwise i am not so sure if this place is a spot that tourists should bookmark as a must see unless they have a lot of days to kill in sgp nonetheless i still enjoyed strolling around here since it was so close to mbs where i usually stay i would rather hang out here for convenience than schlep my ass to jurong bird park it may not be as interesting as say going to sentosa but it is still a nice distraction after a long day in the city or in the casino tip as with most outdoor touristy places in sgp i try to avoid coming here around high noon combined with the foliage it can get pretty hot humid here and i did not find a lot of shade covers i usually come here in the mornings or late evenings that is of course unless you like sweating a lot and feeling sticky all day,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,the gardens by the bay is a must see for tourists in singapore i am incredibly impressed with the cloud forest an artificial mountain with waterfall and several floors with garden themes the walk trail in the sky gives an incredible view over the cloud forest and the gardens by the bay the flower dome is also pretty you should start with the flower dome when you visit the gardens by the bay and end with the cloud forest because anything you visit at the gardens by the bay after the cloud forest is underwhelming compared with the cloud forest also take a warm vest or cardigan with you when you visit the gardens by the bay because it is rather chilly inside,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place is absolutely beautiful especially at night high recommend to all tourists,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is a new attraction to the singapore area and is located near the marina bay sands in fact there is a walkway from the mbs to the gardens by the bay the outer area of the gardens is landscaped with meandering pathways that would be awesome to jog around in the early evening as you get closer toward the water there are two gigantic domes the first dome is the flower dome which is a huge indoor flower garden this dome is nicely air conditioned and was a welcome respite from the heat and humidity they had a generous variety of flowers trees hedges all sorted by geographic region interestingly they also had colorful permanently floating air balloons and whimsical statues placed throughout i noticed a lot of moms and strollers in the dome i guess it would be a cool way to spend an afternoon the second dome is the cloud forest dome of the two this was much more interesting they tried to recreate a cloud forest with a  or  story waterfall and hundreds of misters the effect was that you felt you were in the movie jurassic park it should be noted that the air conditioning was set to a low temperature we think it felt like   degrees so i would recommend bringing a jacket there are multiple levels in the dome that are accessible via elevators escalators and floating walkways if you are afraid of heights i would not recommend going on the walkways it was scary as you can feel the walkway vibrate and flex as you walk this is definitely a must see when in singapore,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay was one of my favorite tourist attractions on my vacation to singapore i purchased the ticket that included both domes as well as the tree top walk and it was quite affordable i think  singapore the gardens are beautiful outside by the trees and it is just a neat experience altogether the cloud dome was pretty and the flower dome was not my favorite but i generally do not care for flower gardens like that i never felt too crowded and there were several pretty places to take pictures you can actually walk around the gardens at all hours of the night which is a really nice feature i was able to see them by day and night they are very well kept and it would be a great place for families to visit,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i think we spent more time in the gardens than anywhere else on the trip the gardens in general are beautiful even when it is blazing hot outside ya know like all the time it is still worth a walk we explored pretty much every bit of it if you want stunning tropical pictures with marina bay sands in the background this is where you go we got so many good pictures in the super trees which are super cool we also explored the cloud forest and flower dome i recommend the flower dome first because it is almost a let down after the cloud forest but it is still very cool just flowers first giant indoor waterfall last the cost to get into the domes and the trees is minimal and totally worth it at christmas they have a big christmas lights show that is so much fun there are people everywhere but find a spot to sit we found a place to lay down so we would not strain our necks and sing along with all the fun songs while watching the show,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,yes yes yes love it will come baack i could just sit in the flower dome and do my work hahaha they should open a coffee shop there the background music is wonderful as well so therapeutic love it,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,somehow i really do not feel anywhere near as qualified to talk about this place than some people since i only wandered around here for about an hour and only got a glimpse of these amazing gardens in fact this place seems to be one of the must see places in singapore which means that i am really going to have to make my way back here even if it is on a long lay over simply to have a look around these gardens are simply amazing and the one thing that seems to appear when ever anybody visits here are the super trees okay these trees are artificial but the are completely covered in plants however there is much more to this place than the trees though you would not think so considering some people is posts because you have some domes as well as numerous other gardens including a chinese garden if you do not visit this place while in singapore then all i can say is that you have wasted your trip,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a very touristy place but not bad if you have never been a bunch of plants and flowers from around the world i like animals more personally but thought this place was still decently interesting would not go again but one time was worth it i think flower dome it is air conditioned inside the flower dome paid section which makes it bearable some seasonal flower designs according to the holidays rainforest waterfall walking around on the glass canopy walkways was a nice touch there is some sculptures and random stuff inside the mountain supertrees the outdoor gardens section with supertrees and ponds is not too interesting and there is a noticeable lack of shade anywhere bring and umbrella if you come in the daytime or be prepared to get roasted they get lit up at night too,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,free admission to walk around but if you want to go specifically to the flower domes or cloud forest there is admission for  we did not have time to do so but just strolling around there is also a children is park which was closing by the time we arrived we mostly wanted to go experience the super tree at nighttime,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,we had a free evening prior to our cruise ship sailing so we decided to come over from the ship terminal the cruise staff said to take a taxi we decided against his advice we being walkers thought we could make it on foot well there is so much construction in the area and poor lighting it took us about an hour it is located by the marina sands hotel casino like another reviewer mentioned it s like an avatar if you have ever seen the movie after walking through the gardens we crossed the bridge over to the casino the next day hubby and decided to take an quick walk back up figuring we knew the roads we shaved off  minutes later as we head back to our ship which is sail day we noticed there is a nice walkway leading to the gardens way before you get near the casino more advertising needed,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this was on top of my to do list for my stopover in singapore while we did not have time to explore all of the conservatories we got to wander the super trees and did the ocb skyway it was after sunset so the lights were gorgeous and the view of the bay from the skyway was really wonderful it was shortly before closing so the line was long but it moved super quickly and the staff was pretty helpful i would love to come back and see the rest of the gardens,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,one of the most fantastic tree flower botanical structure spaces i have ever been to when you go to the super trees definitely pay the extra  usd per person to go on the walkway to be honest it is wobbly and scary but you will get great shots and an up close view of the trees it is amazing to learn how these super trees sustain the other conservatories through the solar panels and by collecting rainwater i would go to both the cloud forest and the flower dome without a doubt i was excited to go around chinese new year and by around i mean anytime during an entire month before to see all the decorations there,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is like a hidden gem in singapore all you need to do is cross the road in front of marina bay sands you will find yourself in a much cooler environment fresh air a quieter ambiance so different that you feel a sense of peace and serenity right here in the gardens there is no need to rush just take your time and explore every nook of the gardens there are plenty of mini gardens to explore you will encounter flowers of all origin local flora that are rare to come by in today is urban jungle and they are accompanied by fun educational facts one can learn from for a reasonable price i also recommend visiting the flower dome and cloud dome the flower dome provides lots of opportunities for photographers who like macro photography and amateurs who enjoys taking selfies the cloud dome is a much more interesting visit to experience a different environment and see some weird looking plants it can get a little chilly at the top floors of the cloud dome of course one must also not miss the supertree groove if you stay until night out this is definitely the place you want to be the trees come to life with accompanying music get a spot nearby on the grass with your loved one and enjoy a free  minutes of musical performance if you visit on the weekend there are also free concerts in that area besides the garden there are also lots off sandy spots by the water along the coast of the marina estuary make some yummy goodies and come enjoy a quiet and peaceful picnic by the gardens there are just endless things to do right here at gardens by the bay i guarantee you a different view of singapore and an uplifting trip for a refreshing mind one has to visit this place at least once,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,cloud forest flower dome conservatories are a must buy the ticket online to avoid long queue at the ticket counter if you are a resident get a resident ticket it is cheaper not by much but hey why not save some extra dollars when we could i came to the conservatories around   pm and i saw a super long queue at the ticket counter seriously i was really glad that i did buy my ticket online come to the conservatories when it is still bright outside they use natural lighting inside the conservatories so if you want to make sure you will have good pictures taken during your visit follow my advice p to get the most of it my itinerary when i came visit was to get there by  pm then exploring the free admission part of gardens by the bay take some pictures  pm i went to flower dome  pm to cloud forest   pm get something to eat around the area read go to marina square for many eateries options come back around   pm explore the outdoor gardens of gardens by the bay you gotta see gardens by the bay both in the afternoon and in the evening and catch the light and sound show happening  pm and  pm everyday at the ocbc skyway,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i loved the gardens by the bay in my opinion it is a singapore must do if you have kids go to the children is garden there is several play sections including a water play area with a great view and it is free if you are just visiting singapore my vote is to the take the mrt in and pay for the shuttle because let is face it it is hot go right to the two domes which are air conditioned and really cool the cloud dome is absolutely amazing and sort of like a lord of the rings or avatar scene stunning architecture views and natural beauty it is pretty heavy on the global warming message just to warn you enjoy wandering other areas after the heat wears off a little in the late afternoon there is a pretty good pizza spot in the restaurant strip by the super trees stop and have dinner there and then sit outside and enjoy the stunning lights display on the trees after dark it is like a fireworks show then join the crowd walking back towards the mrt but be prepared to stop repeatedly because the route takes you over a bridge with a look over the gardens and the whole bay and marina sands enter marina sands be stunned again and head home pondering the amazingness that is singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,before i even had a clue that i would be traveling to singapore to visit my boyfriend is relatives that work there i had heard of the supertrees in the gardens by the bay it was my second priority for our visit after eat all the things i am pleased to report that it did not disappoint due to time constraints i did not visit the cloud forest which i bet would have been cool but i was able to visit the flower dome and take a stroll on the skyway during the evening led light show in the supertree grove i could take or leave the flower dome but the walk through the canopy between the supertrees was definitely cool particularly since we were able to time it just right to be up there for the show we bought tickets at the main ticketing area by the two domes during the first show because we did not know there was a ticket booth for the skyway in the supertree grove by the time be got to the supertree grove the first show was just ending the line was quite long even though we had tickets but we were able to get up with a few minutes to spare before the second show started at   if you do not like crowded elevators you can take the stairs when it is your turn but it is a bit of a climb it was every bit as magical as i had hoped i bet it would be very cool for children to experience i do not know how easy it would be to repeat the timing but the show would be amazing even from the ground which is free we also walked around the free areas of the gardens and i really enjoyed that as well i did not visit the botanic gardens so i cannot make any comparisons there but it seems like the gardens by the bay would be very convenient for most tourists and the late hours are nice when you are trying to pack in as many fun things as possible,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,what a magnificent garden outdoors are foc to the public and there is charges to enter the conservatory area garden musical waltz at  pm daily might be the main attraction of this place,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,kudos to the marketing team from gardens by the bay the video and marketing copy on christmas sugar mountain was so much more then it actually was my keen eyes were trying to pick out any particular christmassy flowers blooms but cannot see any from the video nonetheless i decided to pay a visit myself nothing christmassy except for the clever pineapple and apple display which they tried to tie in with their marketing theme center pieces just had huge christmas trees and to spice things up there were plantations of tomatoes chills strawberries and capsicums only gave  stars because i thoroughly enjoyed myself visiting my favourite blooms to see how they were doing in a comfortable air con environment and also because i love photographing flowers,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,those man made trees are a sight to behold but my fascination with gardens by the bay pretty much ended there gardens by the bay is basically a large park sectioned into speciality themed gardens i was not impressed with the information given about the specifics of each garden or gardens themselves i felt like i was just walking around looking at pictures of exotic plants because there werent very many exciting plants that were real i guess that is what you get for free in singapore hardy har har that being said it is a nice change of scenery to walk around a park instead of down orchard road also idid not want to pay to go into the domes yeah i am cheap like that maybe that is why i was not very impressed,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,currently there future of us exhibition which is available free tickets can be booked online or at the spot,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is free mostly and it is huge two exhibits you have to pay for but most of the gardens are free this place is worth several hours to walk around admire the plants and people watch there are several bathrooms in the park and several locations to eat also definitely do the cloud forest walk you have awesome views of the garden marina bay hotel and ferris wheel the view is almost as good as the marina bay hotel observation deck and a lot cheaper if your afraid of heights it may be nerve wracking but the views are well worth it,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,absolutely beautiful the flowers and plants were wonderful the waterfall was fabulous the night time light show was awesome i would definitely recommend this to anyone travelling there,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,holy monkey moly this set of gardens are absolutely fantastic the outdoor gardens are free to walk around although to walk the supertrees it sets you back approx  prices keep climbing if you visit other exhibits lovely sculptures and beautiful views everywhere super tip you can have an expensive lunch for  sgd up a super tree or choose the  option we were tempted by the former but had already done the latter which is probably a good thing for our pockets to visit the two large indoor gardens cloud forest and the flowers one in my personal opinion cloud forest is worth the entry fee the other not so much cloud forest is a lesson in ecology and in the environment and suitable for all ages it also cunningly guides you around which helps manage crowds but the second indoor space did not which became quite claustrophobic with e crowds milling around in different directions everywhere overall really glad we visited gardens by the bay in the end it is certainly a memorable experience,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,beautiful place it is a must see while in singapore bring your camera you do not really need to take the tram save your money and walk,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,tourists i brought here were amazed by the flower and cloud forest domes the rooftop bar was a good spot to hide out from the sun too would also recommend to come in the evenings when there are laser shows,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,very boring man made attraction that is not fulfilling for an adventurous soul extremely expensive to get in and was very disappointed kids will probably enjoy but overall not worth it,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,absolutely stunning i am not one to spend hours of my time at attractions or gardens but i spent at least  hours here because it was just mesmerizing to see the gardens i took the mrt and walked over save enough time to see everything this place is huge and it will take you a while to walk over the gardens and to walk around the grounds there is an option to purchase tickets to see the two main attractions at the gardens the flower dome and cloud forest it is  singapore dollars which i thought was a bit pricey but everything is expensive in singapore so eh whatever i paid it and went in both dome is were very cool indeed and you can easily spend well over one hour for both i enjoyed the cloud forest more and it helped that it was cool inside because it was sweltering hot out that day after this i went over to the supertree it is  for the skyway which is so worth it you can get a better view of the park as well as pictures from above go on the skyway the  pm lightshow started as i was leaving so i got to enjoy that before i left too btw as of may   it seems like all the construction is done,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is said to be thee place that anybody and everybody should visit even if you are not an avid nature lover like me do head down and explore the various wonders of horticulture and snippets of design and architecture it is also a very popular spot among photographers as the night view of gardens by the bay is rather enchanting the supertrees looked like alien feather structures but it beams with attractiveness when lights on the trees lit up entrance to the gardens is free but for the bridge walk and flower dome there is an admission fee to enjoy those views some of my friends said it was definitely worth it and even bought the annual pass for me perhaps walking and admiring the surroundings at night would be a better choice rather than standing in the hot blazing weather,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,people have said a lot of things about gardens by the bay henceforth referred to as gardens and i went in expecting spectacularly fake manmade sculptures and beautiful architecture it is all that and much much more i just happened to wander around the free areas because i was early to meet a friend at promenade station and saw signs to gardens long story short i thought i would just have a peek but  hours later i was still peeking yes most things are painfully man made but really in this garden city we live in more greenery in whatever form is refreshing and it is beautifully done as well the avatar like supertrees are quite breathtaking at night while there were other parts that i realised would have been prettier during the day one thing i did not like was the racially themed gardens indian malay chinese and colonial i felt really left out as i am none of the above besides that major faux pas for a supposedly multi cultural rojak society the rest of it was lovely i do not know about the parts you have to pay to go into and i hear they are worth paying for but if you want a new place to have a picnic or just chill out the free bits of gardens are definitely worth your time,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,wow i wish i was a child again awesome place for children there is an elaborate tree house play area as some of the features are quite challenging they recommend adult supervision for children  to  years old a water park and a toddler play area for children  to  years old parents can keep an eye on their children playing in the water park from the shaded amphitheater there is a cafe next door for food and snacks nice my children had fun and cannot wait to come back again,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a lovely park amongst the crazy urban jungle of singapore sure it is not as wide open and quiet as the botanical garden but it is directly in the city making it a bit more of a nice break arriving by train is relatively easy but a long walk from platform to the entrance of the park once you are here however it is a pleasant place to stroll around however there is not any specific part that jumps out except the towers which you have to pay for however they are highly recommended as the views from up there are excellent and the price is not too bad,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a must see on a trip to singapore the supertrees are magical at both day and night so maybe plan your visit so you can see the park during both times the skywalk is worth the wait the views are amazing the walk itself is only about min long but it feels amazing to be at the top looking at the whole park and magical tree tops,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,jason mraz was in singapore i was so enthusiastic to see him play live as i heard he is awesome live when i heard the venue was at gardens by the bay i was like ohhh perfect for jason mraz who is like in love with the earth my friend and i were so excited that we went to marina bay mrt and took a bus to the location well the location was interesting it was pretty barren which was fine since it is a concert so i cannot be expecting a lot of things to see then we saw tents selling quiznos subs and drinks here is where i should have known things were gonna go downhill firstly the subs it is pretty clear these tents were set up with the intention to drill a big hole in your wallet i got a tuna sub for sgd  just the sub if you go to a quiznos outlet it would have came with a soup and a drink here just the sub ok fine i mean we have gotta eat since we need energy to watch the concert right and there is nowhere else to buy our food anyway so i went to get water this is where it was just as amazing  for a bottle of plain water wow my water must have been flown in from the crystal clear mountain springs eh ok fine we need to keep hydrated anyway while waiting at the front of the stage at pm the organisers keep telling us not to sit and to stand because it is a free standing concert therefore it makes sense for us to stand and to move forward even though there was no one around oh well fine as it got more and more crowded and hot as we were packed like sardines we decided to move to the hills and sit down and enjoy jason mraz is pristine voice from there the organisers once again told us to not sit down and stand like really this is a jason mraz is concert this is not a freaking rock concert where if we sit the chances of us being squashed is high this is supposed to be a chill out performance thankfully jason mraz came out after and all the unhappiness over the food drinks location organisers were forgotten heck jason mraz did not even mind that we were sitting down and chilling to his music he gave one hell of a fantastic performance that made my money is worth it after that getting out of the location was sheer hell it took us nearly  hours to get out the organisers apparently thought it was a smart idea to do traffic control by putting up barriers and occasionally closing it off it is a garden why do you need traffic control when zoukout ended there were no traffic control and leaving was a breeze so here why if given the option to go for a concert at this location again by the same organisers i am sure as heck not going to go after this nightmarish and expensive experience,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is a great place to go jogging her for a walk if you are in singapore but it is touristic value is not very high gardens by the bay is kind of in the middle of nowhere that would make sense since singapore is an island country and had to dredge up the land from the sea but at same time there is an mrt station relatively near there are wide paths for biking and jogging which is really helpful in such a cramped city in an urban atmosphere the two times i have been here there it has been packed with tourists but i do not really know why to get to the jungle bridges connecting the trees you have to pay for that that was kind of a letdown but it would make sense that it sponsored by a bank overall gardens by the bay is good for a stroll in the city after eating in one of the great food courts,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,we did not spend too long here less than an hour but it is well worth a visit beautiful tropical plants and nice grounds to walk around and relax it is also close to the bayfront area which is also very pleasant to walk around,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,one of the newest and est tourist attractions in singapore we got a chance to see all kinds of flora from around the world in the two forest domes here the super trees are also a treat by themselves too and a walk on the elevated walkways is good too a good stop on the tourist plan for singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,greats free thing i have seen in all of sg i skipped the cloud dome and forest walky things they cost way too much money but this gbtb thing is awesome hints head there a few hours before sunset to get pictures during the day walk around the park until sunset and take some evening shots also around pm there is the nightly rhapsody in the supertree grove right in front of supertree dining before the evening show head over to take pictures of that be white baby thing it is strange but go ahead and take a picture of the biggest baby wanker in the world kekekeke if you walk towards the cloud dome and forest tree top thingy thingy you can do a nice stroll along marina bay if you time it right you might be able to go up the supertrees around pm you are only allowed to be up there  minutes but if you are there at  when the show starts you can stay up there for the duration of the show it provide a nice perspective the show lasts  minutes also so you can take pictures videos up top and then head down during the last  minutes at the end of the night just grab a taxi because finding your way back to the mrt in the dark is miserable unless you are heading to the marina bay sands to gamble then gamble away,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,when they were building the gardens i must admit i thought it was going to be some tasteless monstrosity marring the skyline of singapore my fears prove to be unfounded thankfully i have only been to the main free area of the gardens and i was very impressed by the layout and the landscaping it is lush and green with lots of communal places for people to enjoy the lakeside was also very pretty with sculptures on the water and a lovely little walkway along the side however i think the garden also look lovely by night the lights had been done up tastefully and many have said it looks like the fictitious na vi world in the movie avatar i am inclined to agree they hold nightly light shows with music and many families come here to enjoy being in nature there are also food centers and restaurant there but i found them overpriced and not that great a plate of hokkien mee cost my  so instead of eating there my friends and i held a night picnic there and really enjoyed ourselves we sat on the grass and made music as a cool breeze blew through the gardens we were away from the hustle and bustle and had a great view of mbs definitely worth going back to check out the other paid attractions thank you for not screwing this one up singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is a must see and possibly my favorite place in singapore whether you are in the mood for exercise natural beauty a peaceful park bench where you can read or chat with a friend a meal or cup of coffee a fantastic view of the city gardens by the bay has something for you but do not just walk in and then leave the place is huge and extends all the way along the water past a children is water playground and a hawker center called satay by the bay to the marina barrage with a bridge over the water that separates the bay from the ocean to east coast in the more central area are the cloud forest and flower dome as well as the treetop walk i have done them all multiple times at different times of day and every time it is fun the treetop walk seems a little scary but they even have accommodations for those in a wheelchair there are numerous mini gardens ponds and sculptures throughout i happen to love marc quinn is giant baby and marvel at how the seven ton copper statue seems suspended with very little supporting it and the not as often visited east coast portion of the gardens by the bay is wonderful though without as many attractions as the central area i love riding my bike through this area because it is less congested there are multiple eating options including bringing a picnic and settling down on the grass you can go hawker style at satay by the bay or sit in one of the multiple indoor air conditioned restaurant options in front of the treetop walk or by the cloud forest for a truly special option with  views there is the indochine restaurant atop a treetop i get the sense that those who did not appreciate the gardens by the bay as much just walked in and did not spend much time there that would be like spending  minutes in central park and then writing it off,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,beautiful tips supertree lightshow at  pm and  pm  to go up the tree and walk the skyway must by tickets by pm the view is awesome jonasapproved,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is what every singaporean must have dreamed of at any one point given our hot humid weather beautiful manicured landscapes amidst a cool dry landscape the flower dome is a burst of colour and unusual flowers and plants from all over the world from aussie baobabs plants that look like rocks but are actually plants to the giant ginger looking tree grapes definitely an educational experience there is an event space located in the middle of the flower dome which seems like it will be a pretty popular space for weddings or chichi events in the future the cloud forest next door is like entering jurassic park you are greeted by a  storey tall indoor waterfall and a giant alien looking plant covered mountain take the lift up and stroll your way down do not forget to stare at the plant covered hill and do check out the is ecret garden in the basement it is not secret if there is a giant sign pointing at the door right while i have yet to visit the super tree walk and heritage gardens i will probably head back to gardens by the bay perhaps in the evening this time it is a convenient walk from marina bay sands and a welcome change from strolling the various megamalls that have sprouted up around singapore,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,at night they have light show you can buy the ticket to get on the sky bridge which will be closed at   pm i was on the sky bridge when the light show was going on so pretty at night,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,we had to come here and visit because we were curious about those towering supertrees that we saw in the brochure expect to spend a day wandering around  hours for us you do not want to rush through this place we exited bayfront mrt very convenient with a short walk to the gardens as you walk you will see the towering marina bay sands across the road as well as the singapore flyer and the supertrees the garden is free with the exception of the two domes and the ocbc skyway visit the information center to grab a brochure map so you wo not miss anything visit the heritage gardens malay garden chinese garden indian garden secret life of trees world of palms fruits and flowers and so on in the middle is the supertree grove where you can pay  singapore dollars to walk across the skyway and at the far end you will see these two giant domes flower dome and cloud forest the two conservatories cost  singapore dollars i recommend to see both the  metre man made waterfall is located in the cloud forest so i would recommend seeing that first honestly the flower dome was ok yes it had flowers and cactus and trees but it is all laid out too neatly that it reminded me of a garden center back home it is not like the conservatories that we are probably used to with the humidity associated with certain plants etc anyway just my thoughts as for dining we visited satay by the bay which is quite a walk from the main attractions but worth a visit for inexpensive food it is like their food court but outdoors we had some nice mediterranean food but there are others like satay vietnamese fruit drinks and of course chinese food if you need coffee and pastries visit bakerzin for french cakes etc i reccommend to check out the map and find paths that are not so obvious because there you will find some great spots for picture taking we found a wooden rocking bench and wooden water buffalo to name a few then when you are tired head back towards marina bay sands by walking across the bridge next to the garden for some shopping or more dining options clearly this was a whole day affair we did not get back to our hotel until after  p m reluctantly,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,ugly or pretty i am still undecided but it is certainly interesting ok maybe a little ugly in the day prettier at night but in any case love that the govt has allocated a prime piece of land in the city centre for public use and it is free for the general area of the park and great information on how the park uses biomass as clean energy to self sustain green is great,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,my husband and i had a layover in singapore we definitely made plans to eat a ton here but we also wanted to see something different this place was a perfect place to see some awesome greenhouses and walk the grounds it costs  dollars for admittance to both conservatories for adults both of them are pretty cool but i personally liked the cloud one better because it was super impressive and everywhere i turned i was like whoa that is awesome the waterfall is impressive and all the different vegetation was beautifully arranged and i liked how each floor represented a different height on the mountain the flower conservatory was nice but it was mostly trees some flowers and cactus i think we went at an awkward time because they had a bunch of christmas decorations up in november and those probably replaced a bunch of the flowers that were supposed to be on display it was pretty but i would have preferred to see the flowers if you can handle the heat and humidity definitely walk the grounds because it has the best view of the city you will get to see some pretty cool landscapes and no doubt you will have awesome pics the outdoor grounds does not require a few unless you plan to walk on the skyway and that requires an extra ticket keep in mind that this is open based upon weather conditions oh and i did not have the chance to do this because i did not know at the time but if you fly singapore airlines you can get  percent off your ticket price if you show your boarding pass i read this on the plane as we were flying out of singapore i do not know how long this deal is going on though have a blast,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,amazing and a must see in singapore definitely spring for the  combo ticket allowing access to both the flower dome and tropical rainforest plan to spend an hour minimum in each dome so many great photo opportunities also a great way to escape the heat for a while as both domes are nice and cool,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,singapore is newest attraction despite what everyone says about it being expensive and stuff i found the entrance ticket to be entirely worth it in fact i paid even lesser than the stated s  the perks of being a passion card member a quick note the external grounds of the gardens are free of charge you can stroll through the ethnically themed gardens take beautiful photos with the super trees in the background etc you only have to pay if you want to check out the cloud forest and the flower dome and i highly recommend that you pony up the two gardens under the glass domes are beautifully designed and crafted and you would get to see plants that would otherwise not be able to exist in our country if not for the regulation of climate i did not try to food here as i heard it is too expensive and not worth the price anyway i would rather walk over to marina bay sands where there are more dining choices,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,being the kiasu singaporeans that we both are mom and i just had to check out gardens by the bay during its official opening last month though it was not yet in full bloom with some areas still under construction then we soon discovered that we still could not cover the  hectares garden in a single day we spent hours in the two conservatories alone mesmerized by the spectacular floral displays and learning about plants found in other parts of the world bet you never knew a plant that plays dead it was also the first time i tried floral ice cream i liked the hibiscus flavour but mom said it tasted like flour the intricate african statues around the gardens were one of the highlights to me and i just had to ham it up with the statues i liked this place so much i convinced my friends to take our graduation photos here we arrived to find that other fresh grads had the same idea,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,sometimes being a tourist in the place you live can be an enlightening experience although i have visited gardens by the bay before my exploration was limited to the area around the supertree grove the supertrees look interesting but i was not particularly motivated to pay  to get up to the suspended bridges between the supertrees being a cheap asian i have decided to save my visit to the flower dome and the cloud forest for the future when visitors are in town especially coz i have to pay more than sgd for entry the opportunity to visit the two domes finally came last week with my relatives in town and wow i was very impressed and i will definitely recommend it to other visitors the sgd entry fee is definitely worth every penny we spent almost   hours strolling around the flower domes the dome not only has flowers but it is a huge greenhouse with regulated climate that simulates the cool dry climate of the world is mediterranean regions from my visit i learnt that the mediterranean climate is not limited to the mediterranean but also covers parts of australia mexico california and chile apart from the flowers there were giant cactus baobab trees and curious looking succulents that will fill you with awe the flower beds which i was told change from time to time are showcasing a variety of tulips at the time of my visit it was simply a treat to the senses with the burst of vibrant colors and fragrance if you are into photography whether as the photographer or the model this place is definitely for you so go early there is also a small bar cafe hidden in a corner in the flower dome a perfect spot to enjoy your afternoon tea and scones amidst the sea of blooming colors then we moved on to the cloud forest which is smaller but equally interesting it is structured as a very tall tree that simulates the humid mountain climate with different plants species on varying heights of the mountain after being greeted by a giant waterfall at the entrance you start by going to the very top of the tree and then slowly descending along the suspended bridges that spiral around the tree at times you feel like you are really walking among clouds the plant species here are different from those in the flower domes but perhaps even more exotic i am absolutely in love with the two domes i never knew looking at plants and vegetation can be so much fun the other really great thing about the two domes is that it is very cool inside offering a refuge to the scorching singapore sun it is not a bad idea to spend the afternoon here with visitors and venture out at sunset when it is cooler to explore the city another tip is that if you are planning to spend the whole day at the gardens by the bay there is a decent canteen with local kopitiam food near the supertree grove so you do not need to leave the park for food after we exited the cloud forest we took the path along the water saw a sign about otter activities but failed to see any and reached the marina barrage within  mins a perfect spot to wait for the sunset i did not go back to watch the free led show at the supertree grove though next time i need to remember to work this into the itinerary,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,beautifully landscaped this place really reminds me of a very well done pedicure actually says a lot about the state of my feet i know first thing you see when you get to the entrance is this big bull statue and those majestic avatar ish supertrees i must say they are so much more breathtaking in real life than in photos these trees are very very pretty at night because they are all lighted up against the night sky best part is that they have got solar panels to fuel the lights that is the way it should be i think since it is after all a garden the flora in the main garden grounds are all apparently inspired by the ethnic groups in singapore so you have areas where the flowers are all indian inspired and another area with chinese themes running though so it is actually a good idea to stop and smell the flowers here the other two attractions are the flower dome and the cloud forest one word of advice before you step in here prepare to be blown away stepping into either one of these domes is like stepping into another planet the flower dome is filled with colours and rock like plants and cacti and all sorts of awesome while you walk around in awe much like what i did look out for the sculpture of a hawk that was made entirely out of the roots or was it trunk of the lychee tree the cloud forest is an entire new set of awesomeness firstly there is a huge indoor waterfall right smack in the middle of it take your time to take it all in i stood there for what seemed like eons just staring at that thing you will almost expect to see dinosaurs lurking about there is a basement garden too so make sure you look out for that while you are in here i almost missed it attempting to make sure my eyes landed on every corner of this dome once you are done head back up to the real world by crossing the bridge over the man made river you will be in mbs,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,hands down my favorite place in singapore totally free connected to one of the world is snazziest hotel casinos and freaking beautiful these gardens are amazing for their architecture the blend of modenity with naturalism manmade and natural structures it is all about ecology sustainability and education about nature as a nature enthusiast i adored it but even without loving natural things you have to admire how beautifully done this garden is the supergrove trees giant metal trees with living ivy and flowers growing up them around the park are stunning to look at and even more so to walk on the park even won  building of the year at the world architecture festival there is plenty to soak up and learn about trees the effects of climate change frogs and tadpoles or just a lot of gorgeous stuff to stare at if you want to take a romantic stroll through a beautiful garden great place to take kids mind the heat though in the day time and amazing date place at twilight night i walked in at around pm and by   am i was still mesmerized and wanted to stay longer it felt like a grand adventure to walk around the dark gardens and discover all these hidden gems and alcoves each with their own theme architecture and beauty saw frogs dragonflies geckos and much more a must see if you are in singapore tips  bring your passport to get into the hotel casino foreigners get in free native singaporians pay  singapore dollars  arrive before sunset to walk around and view the park with the sun setting in the background then watch as the lights turn on in the supergrove trees and all the surroundings it is like  parks in one totally different views admissions to the cloud forest and the flower dome are separate but moderate sometimes like around holidays if you book online you get a discount and you can skip the lines  cloud forest and flower dome close around pm gardens close around am i would recommend getting there before sunset again so you can see it all  if you are with a big group if anyone gets bored earlier than others they can wander to the shops or the hotel or casino as it is all very accessible and connected,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,garden of the future this should be an inspiration to any city planner for creating a park such a pleasure to walk through them and while it is hot and humid in singapore the domes are a pleasant change as there are air conditioned initially as a dome conservatory i thought it would be even hotter inside but i was sooooooooo wrong i would definitely recommend both domes though i must admit that the cloud dome is more impressive that is just me and the flower dome is fantastic but super crowded the great thing is that you can go out and go back in if you so choose which is what we did the supergrove trees and the light show it was so pretty seeing the trees all lit up and the show was quite fun it is very informal but i enjoyed it thorough and consider it one of the highlights of singapore i much preferred this light show to the one at marina bay sands which was meh definitely take the time to visit it is well worth it,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i could go on about some things like the price or the location or how it was hard to find the skyway or fancy restaurants along the verdana but dude this place is fantastic kinda like if you took the botanical gardens from the movie tron and planted them in modern day singapore high tech fantastically beautiful green and just stunning take time and see it all,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is a great addition to singapore that will become a world renowned green thumb destination right across from mbs you cannot beat it yes some of the plants have not grown out yet but it add more greenery to the city that was much needed while incorporating interesting architecture with its two domes pollen the restaurant also is not bad i did not care for the malaysian food court though seventh heaven is also nice for artisan ice cream stay clear of the gift shop pretty cheesy stuff the best thing about gardens is the fact that you can run through it they only charge for the dome and tree access and it makes a great jogging trail even in the wee hours of the night,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,cloud forrest is pretty nice with the waterfall feature the flower dome area well i am from california so all of those plants are pretty much native to where i am nothing new to see there for me the outdoor garden was interesting and the canopy walk was fun but not fun enough to go again check out the garden at night to see the light music show,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,this is a photographer is paradise my parents and i came here the morning and early afternoon before i was set to return to the usa and had a great few hours of exploring our main reasons for the visit were the flower dome and cloud forest but we also spent a good amount of time amongst the supertrees and walking on the incredibly tall ocbc skyway that went from one supertree to another the extra  fee to go on the skyway is worth it as it provides you interesting viewpoints of the gardens and also the bay for those who are absolutely terrified of heights even though the skyway is extremely secure you might want to skip it for your own sanity is sake both the flower dome and cloud forest are of perfect temperature which provides a cool refuge from the often suffocating singapore heat there is really no one that you should favor first over the other but once inside the enclosures it is ideal for you to follow the direction of the path that has been designed for example in the cloud forest go up to the top most floor then make your way down in the flower dome follow the numbers of the audio self guided tour even when you are not actually doing the audio tour the entire area is extraordinary futuristic and a testament to the creativity and scientific prowess of modern day botanic engineers and singapore as a nation they might have possibly found a way to recycle almost anything nature has provided and also what humans might waste in their daily lives it is beyond fascinating what is disconcerting is that the fate of our near future might look more and more like this with man made botanical gardens covered in metal and plastic domes surrounded by an endless array of concrete jungles but if they could look this good i suppose it would not be too bad a must visit for both tourists and residents alike,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,love love love the gardens my favourite has to be the cloud forest dome one is acutely aware that the garden is man made however one has to put aside cynicism and arrogance and simply admire how well the architects and designers have translated the idea of a self sustaining garden most of the park remains free and entrance fees to the domes and supertree walkway are really affordable compared to attractions in europe i also appreciate the educational side of the gardens in teaching the younger generation the effects of climate change to our environment i highly recommend a visit to gardens by the bay if you are visiting singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,wow what a beautiful way to end our stay you do not have to purchase tickets ahead of time but it is advisable and a little more inexpensive if you want to go in the flower dome or the cloud forest i recommend going there late in the afternoon because the sun is not as strong when you get there it is totally free to roam the gardens and at   pm they have a light show with music by the supertree grove it cost to get on the ocbc skyway  but you will have a great view of the show and the city lights you will find the ticket booth under the supertrees but they close the skyway during inclement weather get a seat under one of the trees early enough or people just sit on yhe sorrounding grounds show lasts about  minutes if you want to make a day out of it you can go by foot and enjoy the lush greenery and gardens there is also a tram that will take you from the entrance to the  domes  but will not take you around the park what a great way to start or end a visit on singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,before you go to these gardens admire them first from the rooftop of the lofty sands hotel from that vantage to better admire the complexity of these gardens pristinely new and full of hidden surprises like a stepping waterfall we greatly enjoyed strolling through it is an educational journey with several themed gardens chinese colonial thai etc with explanations of how each is formed and comprehended the only negative is we found ourselves here on a sunny day in humid  f heat a bit stifling to us after just coming from our  f summer in chicago,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,a must see when traveling to singapore as there is so much to do and see here we explored the gardens as well as the beautiful flower dome and cloud forest attractions you can easily spend a day walking and exploring these areas as we did great for families and couples,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,flower dome nice place to read a book and listen to music if only they had a reading area too bad there is not a cafe situated inside the enclosure otherwise it would be perfect the temperature inside is about   degrees perfect for escaping the hot singapore heat and to be surrounded by flowers  cloud forest this attraction is kinda pointless other than seeing the enormous man made waterfall also i did not like it that the waterfall made the floors wet and slippery from its residual splashes there were not many unique flora and fauna  the super trees light show it was not really much just some music and glowing lights definitely can be improved however even without the show the trees are gorgeous and make for beautiful picture agst the singapore night sky  best part of gardens by the bay is really the outdoor which is free it has a great view of the mbs beware the hot weather though it can be a put off oh wellz the dangerous of living in singapore haha,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,come one come all welcome to the one the only artificial steel tree in the world to be uniquely singapore you need to visit these steel structure at night where there is a dancing light show at  or  pm daily to see the two domes temperature controleld btw so its basically air conditioned for all you need to know the prices is  for foreigner boo and  for local is it worth it not really but this is only in singapore skip the zoo and sentosa and come,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,omg such a letdown i was so excited to see it because of the pictures of the domes and the tree groves but it was disappointing inside not worth  at all it should be free,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,the meadow was big disappointment as a concert venue my friends and i were there to catch the headlining act jason mraz but left wishing it was held at fort canning instead they say the grass is always greener on the other side but at this meadow the grass was not much greener but also in appalling condition as concert goers we felt like we were meant to trample and level the field which was littered with mounds of soil much of which we could tell was hastily heaped and spread around i hope nparks sorts this out in the near future before hosting any more crowds,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,was there to see jason mraz play at the opening of the gardens and the place was massive loved the layout of the grounds because you can get a pretty decent view from pretty much everywhere and the sound worked well but i guess that is down to the av guys the weather was decent too nothing a frosty beverage could not fix what was not so cool though was the exit plan coming in was a breeze because people were allowed to enter from pm for an pm concert getting out horror everyone moshed towards the main exit point and the flow was so slow that it was a standstill for most of the way out i was part of a crack team to traverse the side of some flower beds hopping over a stream and up a little slope before making it to the side of a walkway and that allowed us to skip a sizeable section of the recommended exit path considering that our exit took us nearly an hour and a half when entering only took us ten minutes form the mrt station this was the one thing i hope they will fix or have a better plan for before the next big event,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is definitely worth seeing and experiencing they did an amazing job on the design of the building and the selection of the trees and plants from around the world it allows you to experience horticulture you may never see with in a life time,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this place was awesome i loved all aspects it was so refreshing to walk into the cloud forest and flower dome and feel a c the super trees were worthy he extra cost,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,so cool and cozy the place is a hip hope type of gardenie like of place flower lovers would adore this surrounding,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,why visit artificial trees when you can see real living breathing trees all around us in our nature reserves gardens by the bay is like visiting a curios shop or ridleys believe it or not museum it is a collection of the weirdest and oddest from around the world like a freak show in itself the structures are a collection of oddities to attract people to visit it hopefully over and over again if you are willing to pay the cloud forest is the preferred conservatory of the two as its probably more familiar and similar to nature the flower dome is just too artificial and landscaped for comfort the place feels like disneyland down to the design of the banners that look like disney designs to the coach bay entrance guides you would almost expect a mascot to jump out from the next corner what is probably worth visiting are the grounds itself which is free there are some pretty interesting restaurants there worth visiting convenient to mrt stations and just a nice walk saw somebody jogging there too educational boards everywhere there was one moment near the colonial heritage garden that made me feel like i am at the botanic gardens but that faded away pretty soon there are even recorded cricket sounds because there probably are not any around sad but probably perfect for singaporeans who want to be close to nature but afraid of it,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,this is very much a modern park with it is own operating micro echo system it is spacious and does not feel crowded even on a sunday it is free to roam around among canals artificial and real trees and plants and sculptures there are however two pay for entry exhibitions that should not be missed one is the domed garden with plants from all around the world it is particularly magical after dark the other and one of my favorite spots in singapore is the domed mountain a high altitude rain forest eco system including a  story waterfall gardens by the bay is a great addition to singapore,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,as one of the newest attractions in singapore i had great expectations for gardens by the bay the website and adverts promise gigantic trees with a variety of flora and fauna as well as two cooled conservatories with exotic plant species it has various segments like the heritage gardens and dragonfly lake each with a different theme i headed to the attraction on the second day after its opening to me it was a real disappointment granted the structures looked pretty impressive from afar but once you get nearer it really is not all that great most of the plants have yet to bloom and are all at its budding stages this results in displays that are more or less empty with nothing much to see despite of the attraction being in its initial phase some exhibits are not well kept and even have dying plants definitely not what you will expect at a garden type attraction some areas around the lake even having missing barricades that can be a potential danger the only highlight of the visit was the cooled conservatory the cloud forest the display was breathtaking with a man made waterfall the towering structure is home to a variety of plant species originating from cool climate countries it allows visitors to learn and admire these plants that are otherwise not available in singapore there is a sky walk in the conservatory where you can see the plants on the structure up close and have a birds eye view of the gardens a video is played at certain time slots that educate the audience about global warming and its effects on man kind with such facilities gardens by the bay may be worth a visit but perhaps you should wait till the flowers bloom to its full glory first,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,a must see in singapore the structure of the domes is so impressive beautiful project for the outdoor garden i thing that the botanical garden is nicer i recommend to have dinner at the restaurant called pollen and then take a walk when it is night time in the flower dome that will be empty it is nice and cold inside,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is my first time here this place is totally fantastic really love this place it is beautiful here i really do not know what to say this place is really big and i got lost within just a quarter of garden by the bay really tiring but is a worth it to be here,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,gardens by the bay is such a cool place very otherworldly and like something from a dream the supertrees are very cool a mix of huge steel structures and live plants they are especially striking at night and during the light show the entire grounds are very pretty with a wide variety of plants and flowers the domes are also awesome and worth a visit the flower dome is pretty and full of unique trees and flowers the cloud forest dome with the huge waterfall is also very cool and with air conditioning perfect to explore on a hot day one of singapore is most unique sites,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,this is a very beautiful place to walk around definitely pay to go into the flower and cloud domes as they are beautiful inside you can take a tram around the park to see the outside portions and hear a bit about each section i recommend going just before sunset and staying to see the light show in the super trees,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i love this place it looks amazing with the tall supertrees and mbs and cbd in the background the garden is quite large and might take up to few hours to walk around and look at everything the least crowded time to go here is probably during noon but you risk sunburn so watch out,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,we say both parts of the garden and loved the cloud forest the best this is a must see,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,after the initial ooh ing and aah ing over the scale and improbability of these artificial structures they eventually remain just that artificial go to the botanic gardens,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,i was going to pollen for dinner and had to walk through gardens by the bay all i have to say is that i am blown away it looks almost like a different world or like a garden on mars it is futuristic beautiful very modern looking yet a good way to present nature i walked from bayfront mrt and i got to see the flower dome and cloud forest above what i love the location is perfect it is breezy it is by the bay right next to the huge space ship looking hotel and you can see the singapore flyer the flower dome is really something else i walked to the food court actually and there were quite a few options so you can just walk by and eat there and chill without spending much the outdoor gardens are free and open from am to am there are other parts which you have to pay for but at least it is accessible to the average person after walking for like  minutes i realised the whole area was huge i managed to see the cloud forest and it is really something else plants from all over the world and in great arrangements it is an amazing concept what i do not love absolutely nothing,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,it is a place to hangout with family over the weekend nice scene and lots of fresh air around,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,place for tourists and first time family visitors once you have seen it you do not have to come back again,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,with the year round heat in singapore i am a big fan of being able to go for a walk through nature in climate control i recommend the season pass the price is reasonable compared to individual entry there is significant effort to produce events flights of fancy and tulips were quite nice the nearby food options are a bit unfortunate though,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,i love gardens by the bay for me to say i love anything is a very big deal i would suggest going at night when the trees and flowers glow the park is free and it is definitely worth wandering around the grounds,Positive
gardens-by-the-bay,concrete jungle full of aimless tourists even the plants were not fully labelled so the only chance of the place redeeming itself by offering interesting knowledge is squandered go to the botanic gardens instead,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,being a huge jason mraz fan i was soooo excited when i heard that he was coming to singapore what made it even more exciting was that it would be held at the newly opened meadows by the bay when you hear meadows you think lush green wide spaces cool breeze and the possibility of even a little stream flowing past unfortunately it was a world apart from what i imagined the meadows if that is what it should be even called was filled with brown soil and big rocks and rubble everywhere upon which i stubbed my toe twice i thought the event was horribly organised free standing outdoor events in singapore should be banned they packed the venue to its absolute maximum capacity i felt like a sardine in a can although a very big can no doubt the organisers made announcements for us to stand up and move towards the stage more than  hours before the event started to make way for the people coming in even though the venue was not even half full at that stage this led to us being squashed without reason for  hours before the event started the fact that all waterbottles had to be disposed when coming into the venue and charging  for a small bottle of water meant lots of dehydrated people what made it worse was that since we were made to squish and surge up to the stage more than  hours before the concert made it almost impossible for us to leave our spots and go get more water it was not a great experience the music being the only redeeming factor and we left even before the concert ended which proved to be the correct decision after hearing how difficult it was to get out after,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,do not forget to drop by the domes when your around especially the cloud dome which brings you to another world,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,amazing top of the must see in singapore list make time for each exhibit the supertree grove the cloud forest and the flower dome do not miss this,Negative
gardens-by-the-bay,anyone who has been to gardens by the bay would agree with me that you would have to be there to truly experience it the architecture and technology behind the super trees are impressive but it was the cloud dome that truly fascinated me i have to honestly say i love the climate control in the cloud dome which sits at about  degrees celsius and it is a huge relieve from the heat if you have been exploring the massive outdoor gardens basically the cloud dome mimics the various altitudes and the vegetation that grow at each altitude respectively the journey down from the top of the dome is absolutely stunning with eye catching flowers and plant species at every bend the flower dome is also another place not to be missed and be sure to get a picture taken at this lord of the rings looking wooden bench you cannot miss it it almost looks as if the bench is coming alive and in its background is a bed of roses picture perfect it also looks like a function room might be on the way inside the flower dome so if you are planning an event or a wedding even that would be an awesome venue,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i think my problem going into this experience were my expectations being extremely high i have heard tons fo good feedback about tian tian is chicken and rice do not kill me for saying it but it was so so and i think that is because i sous vide my chicken at home so i am spoiled with super tender moist poultry that said i totally get for people who do not sous vide regularly how this would be a mind blowing experience super affordable great with a tiger beer but did not finish the plate thinking i needed to come back again,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,what else has not been said about the super popular tian tian chicken and rice stall i am not sure if i can add anything else yes bourdain was here as usual he is right this quintessential singaporean dish of chicken and rice is so perfectly done that you cannot find fault in it incredibly soft chicken fragrant rice and the sauce is deliciously spiced with ginger puree i ordered a large portion s   for a large though so i could get more chicken and got the soy egg for extra protein there was not a wait when i came in at am the crowds came at lunch time when the surrounding office workers were out i am not one to stand in line for a long time and there are other chicken and rice stalls at maxwell is which are probably worth a try too,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,there are  famous chicken rice places at maxwell and they are only a few stalls down from each other tian tian was the original and occupies stalls   the rice plate comes in small medium large the small is only   it is nice to have the option of small so you can try more stuff they also have other dishes but the rice plate is the star order at line a and pickup at line b the chicken rice is chicken breast boneless and skinless which i appreciate it is super tender the rice also has good chicken flavor warning the hot sauce sauce is hot,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian does not make the same hainanese chicken rice dish that your mom used to make sorry mom it is true actually i cannot really say that my mom ever cooked this dish but if she had then it still would not have compared tian tian is chicken rice dish truly lives up to the legend it has become there are enough reviews detailing the deliciousness and tenderness of this dish so i will provide you with a pro tip the line here can get long quickly so plan to stop in at an off time ya know not during the typical lunch dinner rush times i stopped in early on a friday afternoon and walked right up and ordered score shortly after i sat down to wait the brief wait for my order the line grew ten plus long in a snap tian tian is definitely a must try in singapore five stars,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i came here on my first day in singapore and managed to skip any lines as it was about  am score for no lines at a michelin rated hawker stall went ahead and ordered their specialty hainam chicken dish i thought it was good and what snt it apart was the gravy sauce you cannot find this sauce anywhere and it is probably what gives this place the  michelin star rating after much thought i think america has spoiled me in that theres so much options and similar to many of the famous hawker stall flavors here i in singapore i would definitely recommend coming here to try the sauces hainan chicken if there is no ginormous line,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,during my recent trip to singapore i went on a mission to find the best chicken rice tian tian recommended by the concierge at the ritz carlton was the first stop on my quest tian tian is located at the maxwell food centre a short walk from marina bay do not be alarmed at the long line it moves quickly we ordered a medium chicken rice to share but came back again the next day and ordered our own which set us back  singapore dollars   usd a total steal for lunch what makes this place so special is that they do a simple dish really well the chicken is perfectly poached soft juicy the rice is fragrant and tasty not bland like at hawker chan the chili sauce that comes with the dish is super tasty there is chili citrus probably lime a little bit of oil a perfect topping for this chicken rice dish i need to get the recipe for this chili sauce because i want to drizzle it on top of all my chicken rice meals if you are in singapore you must visit tian tian,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,bookmarked this place so many years ago and is pretty much the only thing i know i wanted to check out in singapore haha no long lines solid chicken and flavorful rice they may keep my name,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,born out of frugality and created by servant class immigrants trying to stretch the flavor of the chicken chicken rice dishes are a staple to singaporean cuisine i did the chicken rice challenge between tian tian hainanese chicken rice and liao fan hawker chan the ever so popular michelin guide praised one with a single star and the other was highlighted by a celebrity chef anthony bourdain rip in comparison both prices were similar and they both drew a crowd where the line can get pretty if arriving during peak hours the most significant difference between these two stands was their style one was soy sauce based while the other was a stock based if i had a vote between the two purely based on my opinion i would give my vote to this restaurant i loved the texture and the temperature of the chicken served somewhat cold while trying to beat the humidity along with the meal they served chicken broth and their house version of the hot sauce which complements well when the chicken starts to taste plain i loved this place for the price although it did not fill me up it was enough for me to have the right amount of energy to start my day,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,there is chicken rice and then there is tian tian is chicken rice this is hands down the best chicken rice i have ever eaten the rice is flavorful with a light black sauce and chicken juice gravy over it and the chicken is perfectly moist it pairs really well with the lime based chili sauce that gives it just the right kick the store does lots of takeout orders so you can order ahead if you want to skip the line we got there just before the lunch rush on a weekday at  am or so and ended up waiting  minutes it is a well oiled machine but i would expect a wait of around  to  minutes during peak times on the bright side you can easily spot the store by the long line,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,never eaten so delicious hainanese chicken with rice before the chicken is tender and smooth and the rice is flavoured with ginger scallion and oil it tasted awesome just to be prepared to come early to avoid long line up even so there is a very good system of collecting money on one aide and have the dishes ready on the other side,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,rated to be one of the top places to get chicken rice in singapore so i had to try it this joint has  locations but i wanted to try the popular one that is located in the maxwell food center located on the opposite side of maxwell ave of the hawker center you will put your order in and grab a ticket you will then hand the ticket to the other window and they will serve you your food the line can queue up depending on the time especially during the lunch hour however i showed up a little before   on a tuesday and there was no wait most popular is the medium chicken rice which includes chicken the rice and the chili sauce all on a plate chicken was very moist and tender like what people said but the chili sauce is what makes it really good i highly recommend that you give this place a try although it is not my personal favorite in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,okay so its been  years since i have been here yelp was not in singapore yet but it is still my favorite hainan chicken rice ever braving the long lines can be problematic especially when tempted by so many food stalls at the maxwell food market their chicken achieves that elusive perfect balance between cooked just enough to be tender but not too well done for the meat to be dry texture is spot on gingery sauce and spicy sauce is delicious i miss this place still,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,my friends and i went to singapore recently and planned our days around eating of course tian tian hainanese chicken rice was on our list and luckily we went when there were only a few people in line we ordered  large plates of chicken and rice and  plate of beansprouts and cuttlefish to share the chicken was perfectly poached and tender and the chicken stock rice was fragrant and flavorful the dish was served with a citrus chili sauce which was unique and tasty we lucked out with not having to wait but i have heard a wait of mins mins is standard a must try if ever in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,another michelin rated hawker meal another lineup and another great meal for only sg the chicken was smooth and rice was not oily and tastes good you cannot beat the value taste proposition for sure is this a wow out of this world meal not quite but still worth a try if you are in the area,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,got there  min before it closes the line was not bad for saturd night they cranked out the orders very quickly this place def knows how to handle the long queue which its fame has brought we ordered  medium chicken rice  each  side of vege in oyster sauce  the chicken was solid relatvely tender not too dry skins bone attached most of the chicken were good cuts with minimal unwanted parts when served it already has a layer of light sauce on it but they also privode you with a side of spicy dipping sauce again i wish they have that cantonese style dipping sauce that has more minced ginger slightly saltier the rice was also good cooked in the chicken is own juice the vege was pretty good as well lightly flavored still relatively crunchyoverall the place serves solid food but i could barely distinguish it from the other good hainan chicken rice places,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i can understand why this place is so popular we showed up around  and there already was a line the chicken was very tender and moist though i am confused by why there was no skin included rice was also well flavored if a bit too soft for my taste no aircon in the hawker center so grab a coconut or soursop juice from one of the stalls across and you are good to go,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i love coming to singapore to visit family first stop tian tian hawker stall hawker stalls are the place to eat for some great food in singapore chicken and rice are pretty much a staple in singapore so its easy to find the food here is sooooo amazing and delicious simple cuisine big flavor and so filling good service then you grab a seat and chow down,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,there was a line and they were prepared with lanes set up it moved pretty quickly though i think the other famous spot was closed so this one was extra busy i ordered the thigh and greens on the side the hardest was finding a spot to sit to eat the chicken was top notch flavorful and super juicy and soft the pepper was great i asked for  lol i went back before we left and they were closing and only had breast left they discounted to  each i took  even the breast was super moist i wish i could eat this every day,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i was building this up in my head so much that i was sure i was going to disappointed such a cheap michelin star restaurant there is gotta be a catch right not with tian tian we had to wait in line for about  mins compared to the bay area where it takes  mins to just find you a table this was a breeze the plates bowls on which they actually served the chicken soup while not perfectly clean was cleaner than the others we had at the hawker centers hey that is how it goes right now the actual food the rice was something you can eat just by itself it was flavorful and the aroma was out of this world and it paired wonderfully with the deliciously supple chicken the soup just tied it all together i was disappointed a little bit cause my chicken had bones i was surprised a little bit by that and it did take away something from my experience but overall for that price and quality a must go but do not wait in line too long though the other chicken rice places in the same hawker center and not bad at all,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,okay do bear in mind i have been to singapore  or so times in the last  years still have not made to this place until recently i had one day that i was in singapore before the work week started and i had made a determination to check off the lists on my guidebook botanical garden orchid garden garden by the bay is skywalk chinatown was next so i arrived and it was hot so i was very lost and was happy to be lost lined up to get a milk tea and someone recommended me to this spot all i really wanted was hainanese chicken rice in singapore truth be told it is changed in the last decade or maybe i have changed the first time i had it was in  i thought it was disgusting i did not have any acquired taste for asian food then i barely saw any asians in my life now i must admit i have got a more refined taste for everything asian tian tian has a line on a sunday afternoon at   pm all tourists i gathered anthony bourdain was here the lady in front of me was from london asian british lady on her honeymoon we chatted about this spot and we each ordered a small plate holy cow  usd basically we ate happily with chili on the side we made friends while standing in line the location is called maxwell center or something with maxwell in it you need to walk away from chinatown passing by some super cool buildings that house chinese restaurants into a hawker market space area excellent atmosphere exceptional chicken dish i would definitely take friends and families there not that i have anyone who would visit me in singapore not that i go to singapore that often but this chicken is growing on me and this stall,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken here is sooo tender and at the same time it is flavourful the rice that comes with is chicken oil rice and just like what antony bourdain says it is so good you can eat it itself we enjoyed this place so much that we came back for a second meal the same day and totally do not regret doing it the chili lime sauce that comes as a dip taste delicious too but beware it can be a bit spicy it gives the chicken a bit of kick and a twist it almost taste like a thai lime sauce the boiled bak choy comes with a fried shallot sauce which just makes everything taste better the squid with bean sprouts came with a thai sauce and chili but it was not spicy at all i suggest adding a bit of the chicken dip sauce if you would like a kick,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,great hainan chicken and luckily we did not have much of a wait chicken was moist and rice was flavorful a little more expensive than other options  per chicken rice medium size,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,we were in full on tourist mode and decided to try our luck at the super popular tian tian stall it opens at am and a line begins to form even before opening time we were in line by  am and i was concerned about the wait time the online reported wait times turned out to be quite exaggerated based on our experience it took us about  minutes to get served and that is only because they were running behind and had not opened on time meanwhile a crowd was building if we had arrived at  am the wait would have been at most  minutes with the volume of business that tian tian does they have perfected the service you decide what size you want and pay at the first section then walk over to the second section and pick up your plate of food finally find any seat at the hawker centre and enjoy your meal it is very simple and efficient i have to say that i enjoyed the chicken very much however is it better than other chicken rice in singapore i think not,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian is my default chicken rice place when in singapore located inside the maxwell hawker stall that has been recently refurbished with huge fans ordered a half chicken which came out very smooth doused in some tasty gravy unlike anything in the us their fragrant rice was quite fragrant made using chicken stock their side of vegetables was a tasty way to end off a light lunch too,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,best chicken rice ever cute in shape tastes fabulous i think how they cook and seasons rice is totally different than others,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian hainanese chicken rice at maxwell food center is one of singapore is busiest food stalls with such fans as gordon ramsey and anthony bourdain but what is hainanese chicken rice in short it is seasoned poached chicken with rice served with chilli sauce and garnished with cucumber it was created by immigrants from hainan province in southern china as a cheap and easy meal we hit up the maxwell food center as part of a tour with sneak peek singapore this stall was not part of our tour that sampled foods from other stalls with no wait so i recommend tag teaming with someone the line moves quickly but anticipate a wait of   minutes we barely got our chicken in time before our tour nearly left us behind the stall sells other dishes like vegetables with oyster sauce and cuttlefish but you basically come here for one dish only the famed hainanese chicken rice i recommend ordering the most popular option a medium sized chicken rice priced at  singaporean dollars or about   usd what is the verdict was the wait worth it i think so the rice was perfectly cooked though the chicken tasted pretty similar to other places we tried if you have the time to wait and patience add it to your foodie check list or if you hate waiting like me tag team with another person to wait in line,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i think this was a little overhyped for me unfortunately the chicken was quite bland the rice was a little more fragrant but i was not able to taste why this place was so special it is quite a cheap michelin starred place and i have never had hainanese chicken so i have nothing to compare it to,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the tian tian hawker stall is one of my top recommendations to all my friends who visit sg they have received the michelin bib gourmand recommendation which is right below their star system also i have seen anthony bourdain is raving review for this place as well the menu is really simple the individual orders small medium large or you can buy half or full chicken what makes the chicken special is how overly tender good way the cuts of chicken are typically i order to medium individual sized portion and bean sprouts total  bucks,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,maybe more like   out of  stars if you are in singapore you will most likely check out a few hawkers we actually checked out this maxwell food centre hawker twice in a time span of  hours lol once at night when pretty much everything was closed and once again in the morning to get here before the crowd of people line up at tian tian this place attracts famous chefs and other famous tv personal rip anthony bourdain so i had to check this place out i am giving it  stars since i did not have to wait that long i got here around   and there were a few other people here as well but when we started lining up i did not need to wait more than  mins to get the food and getting the food is very quick we got a medium sized hainan chicken rice bean sprouts and some chicken gizzards the chicken rice is like as everyone else will say bomb however there is a duck restaurant that is adjacent to this place and that even better rice if you can combine that rice with this hainan chicken it would be the perfect meal everything was cheap and filling believe this place is cash only,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this was a must visit destination on our singapore itinerary michelin starred hainanese chicken rice i have watched every youtube video on this dish the likes of anthony bourdain and mike chen youtuber have raved about it having eaten over a hundred hainanese chicken rice dishes i was about to eat the world is best located in a hawker like setting be prepared to sweat bullets we decided to go at night once inside this area with stall after stall of open kitchen you will feel the heat it is hotter than outside the line is long but it moves fast not going to lie i am not used to these conditions as my son and i grab a table with strangers we wait with the large fans above blowing at us with no relief as the dishes are placed in front of me i can tell how juicy and succulent the dark meat looks what i did not quite expect was the strange gelatinous coating all over the chicken i am not sure what that is but i dig in it is beyond tender and the skin on the chicken was very silky again i was a bit bothered by that gelatinous coating as i take each bite it was hard to eat as the large fans kept blowing my hair and getting stuck against my sweaty face i had to make sure i was not eating my hair and the chicken at the same time unfortunately i have had more fragrant chicken rice than this before it is still good but nothing special all in all we did enjoyed the meal the method where they quickly poach their chicken works had i have eaten it in a much cooler environment i might have enjoyed my meal better there are no napkins as singapore has a go green policy you can wash your hands at a sink as you exit out,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian can be found right in the center of hawker center where you see the huge line outside this place is extremely hyped through media and is being recommended on all travel guides and hotels flavor   the chicken is very standard what is special is the rice which was very flavorful as they have adjusted their recipe multiple times per what i have read online wait and line  the wait is  minutes at pm on saturday the wait at ah tai is much shorter and the taste is very similar as it was opened by someone who used to work at tian tian ah tai has a better yelp rating and a better price to value ratio price  generally hawker center is cheap compared to other hainan chicken places there tian tian is considered slightly more expensive at ah tai you pay  for a set chicken rice soup and veggie which is unbeatable and you get the best value of the price for sure comparison to ah tai tian tian is rice tastes better and is more flavorful as they have adjusted the recipe multiple times since opening however the price is slightly more expensive with  if you want the veggies and chicken the portions are slightly smaller and you wait faaar longer overall tian tian is not worth the wait and is recommend ah tai if you crave or want to experience hainan chicken if you do have time and what to taste the best one take a shot and wait in line,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,we had landed in singapore early in the morning and was not able to check in yet so we decided to take the bus to the maxwell hawker center as our first stop to try this spot we got here around am but it did not open until am on the dot a lot of stalls were not open yet so we just got a drink and waited line started forming close to am and the line got long reallly quick the first orders took awhile and we were prob rd or th in line order the large chicken rice to share with  for   chicken was very juicy soft and tender rice was good and goes well dip it in the sauce that they give you i am not sure if i would wait over  mins for this but if it is your first time in singapore like us highly recommend to try this and come early,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,if you want environment this is not the place however if you want local food this is the place to be this is not the only place but this this one of the more popular restaurants that make this dish i would totally recommend that people try it with the home made spicy sauce they provide go light if you cannot handle spicy they will provide two sauce get the rice it really is delicious there is a light ginger and coconut taste to it this is located at the hawker centre center there are many different stalls explore try a bit of everything the drinks are cheap average    usd you have to find your own seats and i would say have one person buy and one hold the seats you wo not regret trying it here you can leave the place without sending too much per person depending how much you can eat i would say an average of  per person including drinks,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,stopped by on a sunday about  minutes before opening and was rd in line the line quickly built up as the time approached opening got a medium chicken and rice the chicken was super tender and a bit gelatinous rice was fragrant overall it was great to try but does not seem like it was that much better than what others would serve was pleased with the experience but i probably would not have been happy if i waited like an hour or more,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this place has gone down in quality since i came here  years ago the rice is lacking in flavor with inconsistency in texture as usual the line is long likely because there is a photo of anthony bourdain the chicken itself is nothing special but okay for a first timer trying hainanese chicken there are better spots at other hawker centers i would recommend this place for people who buy into hype but not for others looking for quality in food,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,absolutely amazing hawker food if you are big on a wide flavour profile or spread of food may not be the place for you,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,one of the most delicious finds during my last trip to singapore hainanese chicken rice can be found on every corner in singapore but tian tian definitely warrant a visit nestled in chinatown is iconic maxwell hawker center this particular stall is easy to spot thanks to the long lines as well as a big poster of anthony bordain next to it their menu is pretty straightforward and all the usual suspects are available steamed roasted chicken and vegetables in oyster sauce for my first visit i cannot decide between the poached or the roasted chicken so when in doubt the rule of thumb is to get both p the chicken was tender and juicy while the rice was flavorful with a mouthwatering aroma altogether there was a good harmony between the chicken rice chili sauce and soy sauce i honestly love both versions but the later added a nice smoky flavor that i like the pricing was dead cheap with each plate costing around   sgd depending on the portions and food was served canteen style simple affordable and utterly delicious cannot help but to fall in love with tian tian hainanese chicken rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i love hainan chicken rice and given that tian tian is the most famous in all of singapore for theirs i had to stop in to give it a try this hawker stall is located inside maxwell food center and can be easily spotted by the epic sized line formed down from their stall the line does move fairly quickly and our wait was about  minutes in total we got the larger plate just because we waited so long unfortunately i was disappointed with the dish it did not even make it to the top  best hainan chicken rice i have had first off the chicken was ice cold i understand that some place do not serve their chicken hot but having chicken that basically just came out of the fridge is quite unappetizing the chicken was also not trimmed off fat and the meat was tough the rice and sauce was decent but average at best they were definitely not enough to redeem the dish from the tough cold chicken meat i would definitely recommend skipping this place,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken was moist tender and tasty i ordered medium chicken and rice with a small vegetables with oyster sauce as a tourist i visited the popular hawker stands hacker chan and tian tian food wise the chicken was better at tian tian so if you only have time to visit one my vote is tian tian however cleaniness wise hawker chan is cleaner i went to tian tian at pm on a sunday and they had not run out of chicken and there were only two people waiting in line tourist tip they do not have napkins at any hawker stands anywhere singapore people carry around a small pack of tissues that serve as napkins if you go bring something to wipe your hands,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,underwhelming i think that is the perfect word to describe my experience eating the infamous anthony bourdain michelin star rated hainan chicken the chicken was cold when we started eating and the only sauce that came with it is the red sauce which is quite spicy so be cautious when drenching the chicken for the first time i also feel like i did not get a lot of meat for what we paid for it was mainly just bone another disappointment the rice was good but i just feel like i expected so much more and that is not what i got i have definitely tried better hainan chicken back home maybe i just had too many expectations but i do not think i will be back nor would i recommend this to visiting friends and family i am sure there is better places out there,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,do yourself a favor and go to ah tai hainan chicken three stalls down instead contrary to popular belief tian tian is not on the michelin bib gourmand list it is actually ah tai that has that honor listed as ah gong in the guide another reason why tian tian always has a longer line is because of anthony bourdain and sadly i have to disagree with him on this one i tried both tian tain and ah tai and i can confidently say tian tian is all hype if you are from los angeles you are probably familiar with savoy is hainan chicken which locals always rave about i have never liked that place and i would rather eat there than the atrocity tian tian serves the meat and rice here is so bad dry and flavorless skip,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,am on a sunday morning i was at the maxwell food centre in singapore we decided to go for tian tian hainanese chicken rice restaurant simply because of the many positive yelp reviews and also the fact that the place was featured by anthony bourdain and gordon ramsay the restaurant opens at am and already there is a very long lineup other places serves similar menu and gets only customers who have no patience for waiting in line service was very fast but do not expect too much except having a chance to taste this famous dish as this a food court and tables are not necessarily spotlessly clean i ordered  hainanese chicken rice the cashier pointed to  vegetable dishes displayed as pictures on the board cuttlefish sprout and bokchoy vegetables i ordered one of each thinking that these came complementary as part of the menu i ordered had i known i would have skipped the vegetables  minutes later i was walking away with my order bill comes to  being  for hainanese chicken and  for the vegetables the chicken is very tender so tender that it just melts in your mouth there are no bones and practically no fat but frankly i am more used to have chicken which has a bit of a bite there is a sauce that you get on the side that would spice the food up but i find the meat to be quite bland without very affordable and worth a try,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,again like my  katong laksa review success has gone to their heads and wallet it is a good thing i went to another hawker the day before so i could compare anthony bourdain and andrew zimmerman have given these places international fame and success now to my review from a pake from hawaii point of view value  star they did not give soup no chicken skin literally on the chicken you had to stand in long line  min flavor wise the chickens taste the same from the different hawker stall i ate at now wait for it the rice was what was advertised light fluffy and flavorful  star worth trying yes,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,queue to this place was crazy i thought it is going to be awesome ended up i got plain tasting chicken with very starchy meh sauce rice was good fragrant but that is about it,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i have heard a lot of hype about this place since it is one of the most famous chicken rice places in singapore i have to say that it definitely lived up to the hype the food was delicious and the wait is not too bad at all i would definitely come back again i ordered the medium size chicken rice the chicken itself had decent flavor though was a bit oily the rice was fragrant and tasty by itself and these tasted even better with some of the chili i did feel that the portion was a bit small so for many it maybe worth going for the large size although for  i really cannot complain beware that the hawker center this place is in can get very crowded i came on saturday for lunch and all of the large round tables were completely full so had to sit on a small table at the edge of the hawker center the queue can be a bit intimidating but the workers are very efficient and i was able to get my food in probably less than  minutes,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,definitely not as flavorful as advertised by many however is definitely good hainan chicken the gravy now is just well gravy it adds nothing and takes away nothing and is just kind of there the rice is still very flavorful and the chicken is definitely very tender however the subtle aromas you get from really really good hainan chicken is just not there unfortunately definitely still a great bang for your buck but if the line is too intense i would try another stand lots of other delicious options to choose from,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,after eating this chicken rice i have realized that other chicken rice are not good anymore i got the medium sized and regretted not ordering large i am going back next time and try the rest in the menu the line was not that long when i went there cause it was just am but during lunch expect the line would be longer i am not done with my reviews i will keep you guys posted for more updates i am giving it  stars cause i am still looking for a better chicken rice that will melt in mouth like tian tian is,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,so many delightful cultures and cuisines in singapore i had to come here after seeing tony is layover show very easy and fast to arrive via uber maxwell hawker centre does not disappoint i had to have the hainanese chicken and rice and side of chinese broccoli and chilli sauce oh man it was the best juicy and so delicious it gets pretty busy during the lunch hours none of the food stalls offer drinks there a plenty of drink vendors in each row to quench your thirst continue on to the buddhist tooth relic shrine,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,famous chicken rice stall in sg is maxwell hawker center the rice is very fragrant strong chicken stock smell the chicken is juicy and tender which makes a good combo to the rice the drawback is the dish was just too oily for my taste and the chicken has a bit too much red meat i personally prefer white meat chicken for chicken rice the accompanying chili sauce helps give a bit of contrast to the oiliness but nonetheless not the best chicken rice in sg for me we also tried the stall next to it which is a spin off from the original restaurant while the taste overall is similar i do find tian tian is rice a little bit more fragrant but if tian tian is line is super long as it sometimes is during peak hours you cannot go wrong with the stall next door,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i got the dish with thigh leg because i wanted my chicken with skin it was well made super tender great sauce and great flavor with the rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i thought i would love this since it was very highly publicized as a must try by almost every vlogger and travel food channel hosts i was excited yet skeptical i was right being a skeptic after all food was ok although very bland and simple for my taste i understand it is a traditional dish although not my cup of tea it was an experience,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,yes tian tian is definitely a tourist destination in the maxwell food center popular tourist destinations tend to be known for being overrated but i thought that tian tian served a decent chicken rice dish you will notice that there is always a long line for this stall but the line moves pretty quickly i ordered a large roasted chicken with rice the portion sizes here are on the smaller size so my large order was much smaller than i expected the roasted chicken was nicely cooked but the rice was what stole the show for me the rice had a very strong chicken aroma and flavor that made it quite delicious the red chili sauce that came on the side added a rather strong spicy kick to each bite it was spicier than i expected i enjoyed the chicken rice that i got here while the portions here were small the chicken was flavorful and the rice was even more delicious all of this for such a cheap price tian tian has my vote,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,order the hainanese chicken many claims to be the original and tries to use similar names at this food court the competition among food vendors are very fierce tian tian hainanese chicken is the only one with the lines the chicken is so tender and silky the place can be very hectic securing a table to eat is another trick look for people almost done eating and then hover next to them look mean so that you will not be pushed out the other day this guy tried to take my table and t told him to back off and he just moved on,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,after trying the chicken rice at ah tai i heard there is a battle between that place and tian tian for the title of best chicken rice in singapore i will stay away from that debate so i do not get banned from the country due to whoever might be working the customs counter that day i will say that this place also had really damn good chicken rice the only thing that i wish tian tian had was a bowl of that awesome soup from ah tai all in all a really good couple of meals at these hawker stands,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this place was good but to me did not live up to all the hype or the long line that i waited in prior to opening i would even argue that the place  stalls down ah fat was more tender and delicious do not get me wrong you can get good chicken and rice at a very reasonable price  sgd for the regular plate but i do not know that i would wait too long for this especially with all the other options available you can tell that this place is used to the popularity modern cash register computer system with an ordering system up front and a pickup in the next stall tip if you come after opening you should not have to wait in too long of a line,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,so good the line was not that bad on the weekend although our grab driver told us it was bad during the week bc of the office workers it was so cheap  for the large it caught me off guard the chicken was cold but it was so good the rice was indeed fragrant as bourdain said definitely get this and come on the weekend it is at the edge so do not get fooled by the other chicken stalls,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,maybe my taste bud for hainanese chicken is much more americanized i hated tian tian is slimey gelatiny texture the chicken was really wet but not moist it had been drown in some kind of soy oil mixture for way too long everything was in a half melted jello consistency the rice was fine but nothing to write home about really turned off by mouthful of gelatinized fat but was later told that part holds the key to every great hainanese chicken rice unfortunately not for me c plus at best in my book,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,best hainam chicken place i have eaten so good that we came back here to eat on the next day during our  days trip in singapore the place is normally pack come early if you can to avoid waiting in line if you have  or  ppl try order half or full chicken and buy rice and veggies separately you get more meat this way,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,so i have honestly had better basically the chicken was soggy and tasteless though the rice has shrimp sauce a nice touch would recommend to try the hainanese stall across from it and the nasi lemak basically do not just come because a bunch of pretentious fat french dudes said it was good right,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,worst example of chicken rice worse than normal food court chicken rice long queues and the auntie will scold you for queueing wrong really not worth the wait or the money,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,chicken and rice was good but lady was so mean better service and same food few stalls down at ah tai chicken over hyped and more expensive for the same amount of food,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,my nd favorite place for hainan chicken rice love their hot sauce as it has the perfect amount of heat to it the chicken is cooked perfectly and melts in your mouth the rice is very fragrant and service is with a smile just because anthony bourdain is picture is in the front does not change my mind on how good this place is for sure will be back when in sg,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i mean it was good but definitely not what i envisioned i would not want to wait in line here for more than  mins we got here before it opened and only  people were in front of us which was not bad at all we waited about  mins in line on a weekday of course we wanted to come here since we all saw this episode on anthony bourdain is show my fiance and i ordered one medium to share since we wanted to try other hawker stalls too we honestly had the same underwhelmed reaction yes the chicken was okay but it was served cold which i am guessing is how it is supposed to be prepared i guess i have been eating hainanese chicken wrong my whole life warm the rice was damn good though with all the chicken fat drippings saturating the warm carb i mean yeah it was good for a few dollars but not something i would go back for i would rather try other hainanese chicken places without lines and just as good ratings maybe i just do not like hainanese chicken after all who knows but overall i am glad i went here and if you watched that episode of anthony bourdain you will want to too to check another box off your bucket list,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,stars for the rice  star for the chicken man that bird is wack i do not see what people are raving about it is so bland and some of my pieces were actually cold to the point i nearly gagged the rice is awesome though that rice with good chicken would be quite the dish,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i do not know why the heck this place is so freaking busy but it is their was a line before they even opened i do not even like this kind of chicken but my kids do so i came for them,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,feels like some kfc guys discovered the existence of real chicken yes it is good it is chicken but nothing special about this one in particular when you already have had well cooked chicken on the other hand the little sauce that goes with it is pretty interesting,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i stood in this crazy long line and it was worth it i have had hainanese chicken at different places in singapore and they all pale in comparison to this place the best,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,if you go to singapore for a few days and you want to eat chicken rice maxwell food centre is the place to go find the corner with the longest queue and that would be tian tian hainanese chicken rice food stall try the green veggies with oyster sauce or the beansprouts with cuttlefish yum comfort food at its best,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,my first time to have chicken rice but it was good its a simple dish chicken breast with no bones over a bed of rice lite and flavorful the maxwell house is outside but covered with fans added a lime drink from the stall across the way,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the first time i had this a few years ago it was amazing this time i felt the hainan chicken was still good but not as good as before,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i came here at  am and they were already serving us yelp says they open at  so i was glad they open early chicken is very delicious and flavorful it was soo good we came back at night for dinner but they were already closed,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,we heard so much about this place it was hyped up by food bloggers yelp trip advisor travel chanel friends colleagues you name it if you mention singapore food to anyone it is almost a guarantee they will mention this place so there you go our expectations were already set high for this place and so we went around   am just when they opened our cab dropped us of directly at the place we got inside and noticed immediately the line to queue up it was not too long yet so we got to the end of it and people were already steadily lining up as well behind me a lot but the line was moving fast enough anyways so did not wait that long maybe  minutes top we got to ordering up and they were quick and efficient probably years and years of experience we both got the chicken rice sat on our tables and began eating it was tasty but the chiken was cold now we do not know if it is supposed to be like this and if it is then disregard my gripe but to me it took down the experience of eating the food down several notches for the hype this place got it was disappointing to us do not get me wrong it was good the flavors were there with a simple but clean presentation but to me the meal itself lost points when it was cold and not hot that is just my honest opinion it is true that sometimes rarely a hyped up place lives to its expectations and i guess to us this was one of those places but do not let my review discourage you from trying it out it is sill one of those travel foods you just got to try out yourself,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,went to singapore and checked out where to eat at hawker centers essentially food courts boom tian tian was apparently a must i waited in a line brief wait for some chicken and it was bomb i was also starving but none the less still a good place to try if you are in the area would not go out of my way though,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,consistently is key and tian tian nails it i was here a last year and it tastes exactly how it did then love how the chicken is so damn tender and juicy i worship we had something close to it here in the bay area it is my go to spot when i am in the mood for something simple but satisfying price is very reasonable which makes it even more appealing grab a beer from the drink stall across the way and you are golden,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tourist crap msg laden rice chicken stock dried flesh due to high business volume tasteless stock laden with starch pls go a few stall down and try ah tai,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,anointed by the travel channel giants as the best chicken rice in singapore recognized by the michelin guide as a bib gourmand eatery all that translates into long lines sterile service and a mass produced product that while good does not live up to the hype  stand in the long line that disappears around the corner  place your entire order at the first window a modern pos spits out a payment receipt and an order tag  grab a tray and spoons  hand your order tag not your payment receipt to the person at the second window where already assembled plates of chicken rice and hot sauce sit  the number and type of plate will be placed on the tray  done the chicken ordered large drum that includes thigh meat tender juicy and impregnated with a lemon grass kefir lime leaf flavor the rice clearly cooked in the chicken stock but flavor not as deep as expected adding the more herbaceous chili sauce adds a good clean chili flavor that does elevate the dish note no bowl of cooking broth as given by most otther stalls a bargain at   sgd regular   sgd large choice of breast or drum theigh meat half or whole chicken side plate of veg also available outstanding for sure just not the best,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this has probably the best white breast chicken meat anywhere in singapore moist succulent and tasty usually i would only go for dark meats but here no issue also if you are not squeamish they have the most tender gizzards e v e r,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,knowing fully well the caliber of this hawker stand among singapore is finest i came in with sky high expectations which is ironic because chickens cannot fly the chicken rice is great but not because of the typical reasons the chicken is extremely fresh and has a very clean taste it is not bogged down by a lot of flavors attacking your mouth from all directions its just a simple clean and honest serving of chicken atop a bed of faintly flavored rice the ginger sauce poured on top ties the dish together in a simple and effective way i like this dish a lot because it is done right but it might not be what you think,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,for some reason i think of this place when i missed asia the chicken and rice is so guud here i think i will come back to singapore just for this lolmaybe it is time to go back to asia soon,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i mean it was okay i was surprised a large was not very large it was drenched in whatever sauce contains peanuts a little is okay but i thought it was kind of overpowering but i also do not like peanuts that much so take my opinion on that with a grain of salt vegetables and broth did not come with it like most sets in singapore the broth is my favorite part so i was bummed about this the sauce was also super fucking spicy i like the ginger garlic sauce more than the spicy red stuff so maybe this will be good to other people but i personally would not wait in line for it again when literally a million other places serve the same thing with broth,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,always crowded in chinatown maxwell food court came here with friends and family cause this is a must eat in the travel book portion was small chicken is juicy but not that fancy i can find better place and less crowd chicken rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this is the best hainan chicken i have ever had in my life the first time i came they were sold out as well as the other famous hainan chicken made by a former chef the only ones open were the maxwell is hainan and some other one those were good but nothing special compared to what i can find at home or just make myself tian tian is ridiculously tender juicy flavorful the rice could be eaten all by itself you can taste the flavor and texture of every granule of rice i dream of this place and their hainan chicken by far the best place i ate in singapore i would definitely come back i actually went twice during my trip,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,years ago you could call in advance to order your chicken rice it would wait for you by the time you reach the now closed car park forget that now and be prepared to queue it is pretty efficient but still takes anywhere between  minutes at opening at am or mid afternoon and  minutes meal times the prices are the highest among all the hainanese chicken rice stalls at maxwell although that is still most reasonable they only give out the chilli and dark soy sauces upon request although that is very much part of the dish so is it worth it if you are not a foodie the answer is hell no on the other hand if you can tell subtle differences in the texture of the chicken the fragrance of the rice or the degree of kick in the chilli sauce or if you just line up servings from the various chicken rice stalls at maxwell tian tian ah tai heng heng you would have to say this is the best lah,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,delish hainanese chicken first time i attempted to try out this place was on a thursday at around   pm about  or  people ahead of me by the time they completely sold out sad ended up going to ah tai which was delish tried again on a friday around   am the line was super long but it moved quickly we got a medium sized portion for  sgd the rice was delish and the chicken was tender the spicy sauce was really spicy and so good i will say that after trying ah tai i felt like ah tai was a better value and just as delish if you are not feeling the wait for tian tian def try out ah tai otherwise tian tian is worth a try,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,my biggest regret is that i did not get the larger size i love rice in general but this rice has been one of the tastiest rices i have had in my life i could eat this for days the hot sauce is also pretty good with it and the chicken is moist and delicious i tried the same dish from a few stalls down but this was so much better,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,great chicken rice worth waiting in line that is about all i can say about that a must visit place especially for singapore visitors,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,overall    came here on a weekday and luckily there was no line up i passed by this joint on a weekend a couple days later and saw the line running all the way out to the streets before you even get into the hawker centre the chicken and rice dish definitely hit the spot the skin was full of oil that was naturally coming out from the chicken and melts right in your mouth as well the chicken meat was super tender and juicy it is always a pleasure eating chicken in asia as it is much more naturally flavourful than the ones in america the rice itself was decent but was expecting it to be more aromatic highly recommend folks to come here and give them a try as it is one of the top spots in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,delicious hainanese chicken and rice the menu appears simple but quite delicious coming from the us we are used to large portions so you may have to order two plates to get your fill it comes with ginger sauce and soy sauce for dipping a must try while you are here,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,overall it is still good chicken rice however the texture of the rice is not what i like does not have that fragrance chicken breast meat my meat of choice was nice and tender liver runs out fast too so most times it is hard to get unless you go early chilli is good they do not give black sauce unless you ask they no longer give soup not sure if they will if asked be prepared to queue just look at the photo i posted most times the queue is a lot longer think they send the china tourists here by the busloads so partly it is the queue and partly the rice and partly the lack of ginger i still prefer ah tai hainanese chicken rice a few doors down from tian tian i guess tian tian will always be famous because of anthony bourdain,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,what can i really say that has not been already said this place has the allure of a  michelin star and visits from us celebrity chefs reviewers like bourdain in the one of many hawker courts across sg this one stands out with multiple chicken rice joints with this one being the most famous and the lines prove it for any hainanese chicken to stand out it is not just the silky smooth mead cut the ginger and spicy sauces that accompany you have got to get the oily chicken flavored rice to be fragrant as well and this place honors all the check off boxes well there are plenty of chicken rice options in this incredible city country this particular one found a way to get famous is all,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i was not expecting my taste buds to react the way that they did when i tried this place i have had hainanese chicken before but most definitely none like this this stall was located in maxwell is hawker center and was really easy to spot it had a line but it moved quickly like i said i was not expecting much cause how different can steamed chicken taste but after one bite i realized how juicy and flavorful it was even the rice was really good i wish i could find a place this good in so cal but for the time being i will be drooling over this picture till then,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,who would have thought chicken and rice could be so yummy highly suggest this michelin star eats chicken is moist and the rice is tasty cannot miss when in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken rice here is overrated in my opinions i do not understand why people are raving about this place the chicken are soft but normal the rice are fragrant bit normal too there are many other chicken rice gems around singapore that have better chicken rice than this place the service here might not be up to most expectation at times the staff could be impatient and rude overall i would not recommend this place,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the rice was great but i want a fan of the chicken on top it needed some seasoning in my opinion,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,mmmm chicken rice since my visit at tian tian nothing has really compared to give there chicken rice real competition located in the maxwell food centre hawkers is where i found tian tian i knew to come here because i researched beforehand best chicken rice in singapore tian tian got voted such by local foodies and celebrity chef anthony bourdain if that was not reason enough a helpful hint i always go by is that you always eat where the locals flock to there is a good reason for that line you are about to stand in service did not take long at all and this line was only  people deep you get served on the spot we ordered two servings of chicken rice that is the reason we came here the rice was fragrant with chicken was so tender and smooth the skin did not bother me it was thin and not chewy like eating a fatty piece on meat the broth complimented it all with chili and soy sauce it was perfect,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this place lives up to its hype i had the traditional chicken rice which came with some chili and sliced cucumbers a small was perfect for lunch in hindsight i wish i had the next size up i can still taste the aromatic rice and the tender chicken the chili has the perfect amount of kick all in all this is a must have while in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,overrated good chicken tender but not as special as you think the service is not so friendly also not worth waiting in line i am pretty sure there are places where they make it better,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this is the best chicken rice in my mind reasonable price and perfect portion for a girl definitely the number one on my must try list to recommend for every of my visitor,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,overhype firstly guys this is michelin bib gourmand not michelin star not the same now that that is out of the way actual food review chicken rice is decent it is not out of this world or legendary there are many chicken rice stores that are comparable or better the overhyped fluffy rice is flavorful yes of course it is because it is coated in grease it is so greasy you may use the plate to fry french fries when you are done in conclusion decent chicken rice there are better this ones overhyped,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,terrific is pretty much all i can say incredibly aromatic rice and super juicy tender chicken first bite is not enough and i ordered medium should have gone large but wanted to leave room for the other hawker stalls they definitely earned that superb reputation the service was fast and nothing beats this hands down,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the best ever though my hunger for any good food coming from the states made it hard for me to be a very critical of much of amazing food that singapore offers but out of  hainanese chicken dishes i tried elsewhere during my stay there i liked this one a lot along with its affordable price,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,came here twice during my singapore vacation that is how good it is it was not super awesome or anything but just enough for me to crave for it a second time around and it is not the most super clean stalls but the workers make a real good attempt of cleaning throughout the day it is cash only here,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this spot is famous for their hainan chicken so i made it a must stop on my trip to singapore we got there right when they opened so there was not a long wait as we were waiting for our food the line started to form we got a half order which was around  the portion is huge my bf and i shared and still had leftovers the chicken is moist but nothing special i feel like i can get better chicken back home sadly this place was all hype for me,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,we went to the maxwell road hawker centre specifically for the tian tian hainanese chicken rice luckily the line was not long so we did not have to wait much i would not say the chicken was all that great it looked a bit raw so there were parts we decided not to eat however the rice was so good it was so flavorful i think i could have eaten a whole plate of just the rice itself,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian is chicken are amazing i prefer the rice in another establishment but in my opinion they serve the best chicken in the country they are tender and full of flavor love it,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,good to bring your overseas friends to experience real singaporean style chicken rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,what can be said that has not already been said damn good chicken rice there are a lot of great chicken rice places and being a westerner i will be honest i cannot really tell the small difference between them but what i can tell you is what tastes good and this dish is one of those damn good ones maxwell hawker center itself is a little smaller and easier to navigate it is a good introduction if you are new the hawker area get you some,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,located within maxwell hawker centre is probably the best hainanese chicken rice you can find in singapore this place is really worth the hype it has won multiple awards and beat gordon ramsey in a hawker food challenge and the prices are very reasonable go at an off peak hour to avoid the lines and the wait should not be more than  minutes we ordered a whole chicken a vegetable with oyster sauce and three rice for the three of us and were able to finish everything unlike other places that just serves their chicken plain at tian tian they dress up their chicken with an awesome sauce that makes it taste velvety smooth they also do not offer the typical chicken broth or ginger sauce but those are not really necessary the rice itself was fragrant and full of flavor and the garlic chili sauce was just perfect with the right amount of heat the vegetable with oyster sauce is just your typical baby bok choy blanched in water so nothing to rave about but we always order some veggies with every meal definitely stop by here to try singapore is national dish and eat like a local,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,when we showed up to the maxwell centre yesterday afternoon we saw a long line and worried that it might be for tian tian and we were right that said the line itself while looking a bit daunting moves along relatively quickly after all how long can it take to serve a bunch of chicken rice we ended up getting to the front of the line in about  minutes time not too bad and we were served shortly thereafter unless you are really full already i would go with a large which in all honesty is not that large to begin with once we found ourselves a table we chowed into the famous chicken rice and in all honesty it is pretty good but it was not quite as amazing as waiting in line might make you expect the chicken is flavored well although the sauce is a bit on the light side i really do enjoy the cilantro here but the quantity of leaves is pretty small speaking of quantity the amount of chicken is also a bit less than i would expect and with the pieces served with bones in them you do have to work your way around it to get the meat off no small feat when you have no napkins and no knives to help with the rice is really well flavored on its own i could probably just eat that as a standalone and the combination of the marinated chicken with the rice makes it easy to understand why it is so popular so why the average rating as i mentioned the quantity of food was a bit low for s   it is not a bad deal but consider when we decided to give tong fong fatt a few stalls down a whirl it is no contest their chicken is better you get more of it as well as soup it is cheaper to boot and perhaps best there is no line so despite the accolades that anthony bourdain and all the other testimonials say the food here is certainly good but it is not even the best version that is available amongst the rest of the hawker stalls,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i do not know that tian tian is so radically different from other chicken rice places to warrant the line that starts winding around the corned even before opening time but it is well executed a tiny plate filled with two ways to mainline chicken flavor  the chicken which somehow tastes less like chicken than  the rice which tastes like ten chickens the chicken pillowy and soft like a baby is skin needs the accompanying spicy sauce and is mostly enjoyable for its texture the rice needs nothing,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,whenever you have something so hyped up whatever it is it rarely meets the expectation for most i always take that into consideration and so i actually avoid reading a lot of reviews in depth and just let my own taste buds decide and if your taste buds are like lily f is then you will be very happy with tian tian is chicken the line is not that long you guys i mean it looks long but when you have a team of  no non sense chinese people trying to bust out as many chicken meals as possible to take your money you wo not wait more than  mins and i was completely outside the line wrapped around the building i ordered the half chicken because i wanted to gorge myself on this dish i liked it a lot the chicken was cold very smooth and velvety if that makes sense i actually liked the sauce but thought that there was too much of it and would have been very content with just the ginger chili sauce which was the best i have had in sing they poured a lot of the soy based sauce on my dish and i ended up tasting that more than the chicken rice was good but not as memorable for me like most i wanted to complain about the rice and the vegetables costing extra and i miss my clear broth soup it helps wash everything down but it was  sin so yeah it was awesome come here if you have the chance it is definitely worth the visit and judge for yourself,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i was in singapore for  hours it was an amazing layover when i was in singapore i made it a goal to try singapore is most famous and iconic dish hainanese chicken and rice every guide book and every local has told me that this is definitely the spot to try it now i am an exchange student in thailand right now in bangkok to be exact hainanese chicken and rice is also very popular here and it is the place where i tried it for the first time it is very delicious and very cheap in thailand it costs less than  us dollars with that being said i was really looking forward to trying it in singapore the home of this iconic dish when i arrived i was happy and sad to see a line happy because it means the food is great and sad because it means i will have to wait i eventually got it and i have to say it is very good but i will be honest the hainanese chicken and rice i have had in bangkok tastes better but the hainanese chicken and rice in this restaurant is still great and it is definitely worth a visit when you are in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this chicken rice stall is famous because anthony bourdain featured it on his show it is also how i came about finding this stall though i have to say there were about  people ahead of me in the queue and majority of them where singaporeans so it cannot be that bad right it is boiled chicken honestly i think it is a cooking style that wo not suit a lot of westerners it is more about textures rather than flavors i ordered a large and it came with its own plate of rice the chicken was lean with a bit of fat and the meat overall was soft and juicy the skin was very silky and went well with the rice under was a layer of cucumbers which to me was pointless the highlight was the rice superbly fragrant a little oily and i could taste the ginger and garlic chicken rice is singapore is national dish so it is worth trying at least once even if it is not tian tian is version,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,visited singapore in june and had to try this place since anthony bourdain had given such a high praise i proceed to grab a tray after i ordered my dish and was told not to since i only ordered one thing  point goes to the customer service the chicken was dry and bland rice was so so i think they have been riding on bordain for too long it was really mediocre in comparison to sergeant hainanese chicken rice in the vivo city food court on the way to santosa island,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this is my favourites of local singaporean delicacies the chicken is the most tender and soft compared to othee restaurants and stalls just like how anthony bourdain said the rice is fragrant and has a delicious taste to it the rice is so good it could be eaten on it is own anthony bourdain i am not joking it is really that good please try it for yourself and you will surely come back again,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the hawker stands here were incredible but the chicken rice was definitely the star it just looks like a pile of normal rice but it has such a rich flavor and pairs really well with the pretty unassuming chicken the drink stands are separate from the rest of the food stands so be sure to grab a beer to pair with it like a tiger the bok choy was also delicious it was super rich and very oily so be aware of that we went to the stands at around pm so most of them were closed or closing but this was still open and the line was in and out be sure to bring a pack of tissues as the eating area was not particularly clean looking by western standards but that totally was not a problem at all definitely come here for the chicken rice and check out the rest of the stands,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,food    service    value    decor    overall    sgd for a chicken rice is on the higher side for this center and the shop definitely struck me as perhaps a bit over rated given how not mind blowing the food was if you are a local for sure go for a line less slightly cheaper alternative if you are visiting do tian tian at least once there is not always a long line and as others have stated the line moves quickly,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,hainese chicken was delicious they only give the chili sauce now we were looking forward to trying the entire experience with all  traditional sauces pricy for quarter chicken dinner,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,located in maxwell food center this hawker stall had a small and quick line i got the  singapore dollar size place which was a nice portion the rice was super flavorful i could even just eat the rice itself and my tastebuds and tummy would be happy the chicken breast was also super juicy and tender was very happy with my choice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,what this place has going for it is that it has been featured by anthony bourdain and gordon ramsay so it is going to get a crowd on any given day just on that reputation so while this place is very good you should just ignore the other options at the maxwell hawker food center because i ate at other places that we are just as good if not better see my other reviews as for tian tian i did come here to try the chicken rice which is the signature dish there was a line when i showed up and while the prices was definitely ridiculously low customer service is not what this place is known for but rather getting you in getting your cash and getting you out which is fine because this is essentially a fast food joint that just happens to make really good food as for the food itself it is very good and tastes fresh i was expecting an assault on my taste buds but that never happened until i used some of the hot spicy sauce and poured it over my food then it got some serious kick remember the chicken is essentially poached and the rice it just has subtle flavoring so you do need to kick it up a notch my first bite of the chicken was a bit disappointing because it was half cartilage but the rest of the chicken on my plate was pure meat so it made up for the nasty first bite of crunchiness all in all i am glad i experienced this spot but as i said do not sleep on the other options at maxwell because they are a plenty,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,drop by maxwell market on a saturday afternoon and saw the stall has almost no queue told the cashier that i wanted a plate of chicken rice and was told  as a plate of drumstick plus rice was   i asked what else is included immediately she said no drumstick and i said your menu said so immediately she printed another receipt for a plate of chicken rice at   this is the going price for a hawker stall elsewhere i wondered how much the tourists in front of me paid for the similar looking plate of chicken rice the cashier obviously know what she was doing the chicken rice was in clumps made worst by the thick sauce they pour on the chicken possibly to flavour it chicken was not flavourful as they need to poured the thick sauce over it good steamed chicken does not need any condiments enough said the old swee kee chicken rice wins hands down compared to this,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the food is superb chicken was tender and juicy accompanied by the fragrant and fluffy rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,is it worth the hype i would say it met expectations i was pleasantly surprised to not be disappointed the chicken was tender the sauce was the perfect amount of spicy the rice was oh so fragrant and brothy it helped that we did not have to wait long for the food the short line at  am on a saturday moved very quickly to get the most popular dish ask for chicken rice only comes in medium size all for only  sgd loved the dish travel channel did not disappoint and now i miss singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,truth be told i never tried the hainanese chicken rice before and was not sure what the hype was about other than the famous anthony bourdain visiting this stall came here with a couple of friends and we went super early before opening time to avoid the long lines place opened roughly around am but do be prepared to wait in a line since this place is pretty popular among the locals and tourists wait time for the food was not too long and the portion amount was decent overall the chicken rice was not mind blowing but rather it was a tasty dish the rice was quite flavorful and fragrant and the chicken was soft and tender i definitely like the house made chili that definitely had a lot of zing and spicy to it still have not figured out why there is such a craze for this dish but it is worth the try if you like chicken rice also i noticed that a lot of other competing chicken rice stalls have a similar look to tian tian so do check the names before waiting in line if you are looking for the famous chicken rice place aka tian tian another recommendation i have is if you are in a group have one person make the order for everyone saves time and it does make the line shorter,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this place is so freaking good best chicken and rice i have had in singapore and let me tell you i ate chicken and rice for  days straight at different places but nothing compares meat is juicy soy sauce is sweet salty rice is perfectly flavored and the chili sauce is spicy my friend and i came before the lunch rush so there was only a  min wait but when we left it was outside the stand only downside would be that in comparison to other places they do not give you as much food for the same price   sgd i know other places i went to it was the same price but it was included with soup and veggies as well this place just serves chicken rice and cucumbers nice and simple but i would have liked some soup on the side for a complete meal definitely worth the wait and the hype give it a try if you are ever in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,one of my favorite chicken rice in singapore taste so good during lunch time or weekend the queue can be disastrous last time i queue for  minutes but its worth to tryconclusion recommended must try,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,chicken rice is the official unofficial dish of singapore everyone says you have to try it when you go to singapore so we decided to try out the most famous place in the city of course there was a line here but the service is really fast i got the chicken rice for   sgd the chicken is almost like a sou vide preparation where it is barely cooked with a savory sauce poured on top of it and the rice it was not my favorite dish but it was tasty i think the popularity has more to do with it being a traditional comfort food for locals the one thing that locals really like but others do not really understand why they love it so much maybe my tastes are the weird one and everyone else likes it i suggest you try it for yourself,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this may be a case of ymmv but i found this place to be overrated mayb it is because of the constant demand countless bowls of chicken rice are served continuously there was a line that wraps around the corner when i first came and there still was a line after i finished eating the chicken rice hmmmm it was not fragrant at all it was cold and hard not what i would expect thumbs down on the rice for me the chicken hmmm i found it to be course and dry in the breast area and the leg was nice and silky i did not mind it actually but to claim as the best i doubt it i have had so much better in shenzhen and also in melbourne this is my experience only give it a go still it may be different for you at least it is one to cross off the list,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,delicious chicken rice line is long but goes so quick take a picture of the menu and pick out what you want while you wait go early before they run out in the evening ordering tip comes in  sizes small medium and large small is rice chicken sauce all on one plate if you want the chicken and sauce separate from the rice order the medium or large,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,wow so sad to find out this place was such a huge disappointment cold pieces of chicken that were questionably cooked on bland rice no lines no wonder i agree with another review stating that with increased popularly and demand must come increased responsibility to keep up the quality this was so bad i did not finish it and had to drink beer to wash it down carry on to duck noodle oriental stall their braised duck noodle was amazing and washed out the bland from my palate,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,do not get me wrong it is very good hainan chicken and rice but is it worth the wait maybe if you are waiting for less than  min luckily when i was here i arrived as it opened at am and there was no wait it seemed they have a pretty good speedy efficient system down pat too of course i got the small chicken and rice plate as someone that grew up eating chicken and rice very frequently as a quick meal my grandmother or father would throw together i thought it was too overhyped for me i can imagine as someone who does not eat it frequently at home it is pretty darn good still fragrant fluffy rice packed with umami and juicy well cooked chicken definitely delicious but my preference is still grandma is chicken and rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,there is no better way to describe this place than overratedi know there are a significant number of rave reviews but to me this is just another stall that does not meet the hype and is exaggerated by the anthony bourdain visit during my very first time here the queue extended all the way around the corner of maxwell but luckily moved at a fairly decent pace waited about  mins i ordered the smallest portion at  just to get a taste while the rice is definitely soft and fragrant the chicken was flavorless and cold i have never received chicken and rice in singapore with cold chicken so assumed this was the specialty of tian tian but aside from just being tender there was nothing about the way this dish was served that marked it as something i would come out of the way for the second time i came here was out of my boyfriend is interest to try and had the exact same experience personally definitely not worth the wait in the queue although give it a try if you are lucky enough to not have to wait i would say you can very easily have a much better meal at another stall at maxwell,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,love it worth the queue   one of the best chicken rice vendors in singapore and perhaps the world the rice is fragrant and fluffy not overcooked you can taste and feel the individual grains as you shove each spoonful into your mouth no kidding the steamed chicken is flavourful tender and melts in your mouth the chilli sauce with ginger complements both chicken and rice perfectly adding a tantalising kick to every bite and you have the option to order some steamed oyster sauce veggies as a side if you feel the need to be healthy amidst the amazing hawker fare in singapore all round satisfying dish pair your chicken rice with is ugar cane juice with lemon from any stall in maxwell market to make this the quintessential singaporean meal side note drooling as i type this review need to planning my next visit to tian tian,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,overrated and rude i would say they are a victim of their popularity but this feels like a self inflicted wound you will find just as good chicken and rice at some of the smaller more gracious stalls with shorter queues,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,wow i will fly back to singapore just for the chicken rice dish from tian tian there is so many great food in singapore but this was the only place i made every effort to come back twice before heading back to the us the rice the chicken the sauce it is perfection come early to avoid the queue i got here at around am and both times had less than  people in front of me,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,stars can not even describe this place i was afraid that it was overhyped since there are plenty of reviews on it and even anthony bourdain has eaten here but its all true there is no overhype tian tian definitely lives up to all the hype the chicken plate for  is amazing i have never had chicken so juicy and tender and flavorful just from looking at it you can see the plumpness of the chicken meat you can actually taste the flavor of chicken i did not even use the sauces as the chicken itself is the star i did not want any sauce to takeaway from the star of the show i really wish la could get their hainan chicken act together even something half as good as tian tian would be nice to have and the rice is just heavenly rice itself is perfectly cooked light and fluffy the flavors of chicken have immersed itself into each grain of rice eaten together with the chicken its like a party in your mouth i went on a weekday around pm so the line definitely died down waited about  minutes before i ordered and another couple minutes to grab the plate of food after you get your chicken you can grab a drink at one of the juice stalls in the area there is one directly across from tian tian i am salivating just writing this review i want some tian tian hainan chicken rice,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,thanks to bourdain tian tian has achieved celebrity status yes it is good but definitely not the best chicken rice in singapore still if you are in maxwell road market during off peak hours it is worth trying tian tian if the line is not long i jumped into the line when i noticed it was just a couple of folks on a weekday at around pm that is when i noticed they had receipts with them i obviously missed something it did indeed turn out to be too good to be true tian tian is recent notoriety has enabled them to take over the stall next door solely for taking orders and handling payment so customers move assembly line style down to the next stall to receive their order it is efficient but not very friendly the rice is the star fragrant and flavorful the chicken is really moist and works well with the chili sauce thick soy sauce is available too but you have to request it which you should all in all pretty stellar chicken rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i am not very often angry when receiving bad food disappointed yes upset maybe but never angry while i know that food review sites and awards are always subjected to the reviewer is tastebuds i never really thought that i would get so angry over a stall that does not deserve its award until today for years i have been wanting to give tian tian chicken rice a try but could never bring myself to join the crazy queue than came singapore is edition of the michelin guide and with a bib gourmand recommendation the queues became even longer and after tasting it for the first time today i cannot help but think why tian tian chicken rice lacks just about everything i would consider as a good chicken rice the rice while the texture of the rice was fine it was neither fragrant or tasty it lacked the depth that a lot of better chicken rice places have it did not have that pungent garlic or ginger taste or the umami ness of the chicken stock used to cook the rice while the colour looked on point the flavours were severely lacking the chickenseeing that it was our first time trying we ordered a portion of white boiled chicken and a portion of the roasted portions were generous but the meat was overcooked and stringy the white chicken did not have the smooth moist juicy texture that help make chicken rice so famous instead it was overcooked and stringy the roast chicken did not fair any better overcooked stringy and the skin did not offer any flavours to the protein the only plus point was the sauce that was drizzled over the chicken which was fragrant and tasty but even that could not offer any redemption to the overall disappointment to the dish to the tourists that have tried it because of the bib gourmand my sincerest apologies for not offering you the best chicken rice experience in singapore and for those you are thinking about trying please do not there are better options out there michelin recommended better to rip that page out of the book,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,there is a reason why the lines are long at tian some of the best chicken and rice i have ever had do not miss out on this singapore must have it is a super fun area and very economical,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the good flavor aroma of the rice price friendliness given how busy they are it is street food not so good lineup mine was  mins which is ok i guess but that was at  pm verdict no reason to suffer from fomo if you cannot make it there is plenty good chicken rice around singapore though the rice might not be as flavourful almost as good that deliver a great overall taste of the entire dish experience,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,awesome chicken and rice the rice is delicious deep fried prawn was also very good i highly recommend,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,sooooo this was my first time in singapore and my first time at a hawker center tian tian was recommended to me by a singaporean malaysian chinese friend from the states who had visited before this was also my first time trying hainanese chicken rice i was impressed to say the least lemme just say this place is hyped up but it is for a reason this is a no frills order at the counter sit down in the singapore humidity and eat type of establishment when we approached the stall there was already a small line formed first you pay for your order then you wait as it is assembled i waited for about  minutes before receiving my food i ordered a medium sized chicken rice with the soy sauce and the spicy sauce it was incredible the chicken was perfect i am a big fan of big flavor and i was a little surprised that boiled chicken would be so good i mixed with the thickened soya sauce and it was heaven the rice was fluffy and in the words of anthony bourdain absolutely fragrant and the cucumbers added perfect refreshing crunch i was starving on this day and i just had to go back for seconds i ordered myself a small size chicken rice this time the cooks at the counter chuckled and said back for more i said its so good cannot stay away they had a hoot and i left absolutely satisfied as a tip the small and medium sized are pretty much exactly the same so save yourself a couple of sgd and order a small you will get the same amount this place is delicious an absolute cannot miss in singapore boy wish we had this back in the states,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,you can easily spot where tian tian is in maxwell as soon as you see a quick moving line staff are brusque but efficient  for chicken rice although my friend who wanted to opt for vegetables instead of rice got charged  even without rice not sure if that was a result of miscommunication or being ripped off since she was obviously foreign lol the chicken rice is worth the hype in my opinion and the chili is amazing besides the chicken and fragrant rice the chili that comes with hainanese chicken rice is really able to make it or break it for me in tian tian is case it definitely made it i will be back,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,a phenomenal plate of fragrant rice and succulent chicken do not be tricked by the knock off stalls with similar branding and do not fear the very fast moving queue one of singapore is iconic dishes and for a reason,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,no frill no gimmick just good ol hainanese chicken rice service can be spoty some people pay for different price   vs  sgd with no size difference but oh well they have good food chicken rice is fragrant pillowy and fluffy chicken was soft perfectly cooked and the chilli sauce complement the dish very well,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,honestly i came here because of the reviews but really i could not see how this place tasted any different than a regular hainanese chicken spot not sure what the big deal was but for waiting in line for  mins i expected it to be awesome which it was not,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,we wondered to the maxwell hawker enter because it was across the street from our hotel it was early a bit past am and we were hungry looking through the stalls we saw this one that was first of all open and operating at this hour also had a few people lined up we ordered medium size chicken and rice the rice was so tasty loved it steamed chicken was okay then we read that this place was recommended by antony bordain hence group of european looking tourists in the que for  sgd it was perfect the maxwell center has a lot to offer too so we ended up trying the oyster cake and a sugar cane drink coming back tonight to try the ramen from one of the stalls,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,yikes the hype from this place is overwhelmingly high but the chicken unfortunately does not live up to my standards chicken is my favorite meat and this place i did not even want to finish my small order i did not taste much chicken flavor in the rice the chicken meat was mushy and i had to wait in line for this plate of sadness is this what chicken rice is supposed to taste like,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian is in a food court so we took full opportunity and buffed up our chicken rice meal with giant coconuts and popiah from the other stalls back to the main event the line for tian tian was really insane at the time i was told that some stalls in singapore recently gotten themselves a michelin star and i was wondering if this was one of them i checked they do not have one yet i am pretty sure that when we arrived at pm we had at least  people in front of us however i must give them props for efficiency it was far quicker than expected we ordered hainanese chicken rice beansprouts taugeh and vegetables with oyster sauce i think the reason why it is so famous is their absurdly fragrant rice the sauce on the hainanese chicken is really good too on top of that the hainanese chili sauce is really very good if you have time want a decent hainanese chicken rice come here however please do not be too overdressed it gets kind of hot in this food court,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tip avoid the long lines by going early they open at am so what is the verdict is it worth the hype i would say it met expectations i love me some hainan chicken rice i only have savoy from monterey park to compare it to i was pleasantly surprised to not be disappointed the chicken was tender the sauce was the perfect amount of spicy the rice was oh so fragrant and brothy it helped that we did not have to wait long for the food the short line at  am on a saturday moved very quickly my only gripe is that i wish the portions were bigger i want more wahhh to get the most popular dish ask for chicken rice only comes in medium size for only  sgd,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i am no expert regarding hainanese chicken rice i just know that this chicken rice was really good good enough to want to eat every day but i do not because i need to try other stuff before i leave the chicken itself is simple tender and provided with a tasty chili sauce on the side simply good go during off hours so that you do not have to cue both times i have been there in the mid afternoon hours pm pm there have not been lines maybe i just got lucky,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i got there early just right after the opening time and able to avoid any line  minutes into my meal the queue was quite long quick and efficient service nothing fancy have to say i enjoyed my meal a lot the rice is soft and fragrant tender chicken meat though mine was a bit cold and the vegetables were crunchy and sweet i ordered medium chicken rice and struggled to finish it all big portion for   people i recommend order half chicken and add some rice great portion and affordable,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,hainanese chicken ricei came here following many recommendation from tourist books guides but sometime i do wonder whether is true however now that i have tried this i can see why this is a must place to try this is so delicious i could eat several boxes the chicken was succulent and what chinese people would say  meat is so juicy the rice is full of chicken flavour and nor too greasy either this is a large box for under  sd very value for money,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i was told tian tian has the best hainan chicken in singapore that is why even though it was closed the first day i went on a thursday evening i decided to go again the next day well first things first the price was unbeatable only  for a chicken rice plate although the portion was not that big it was pretty filling and i felt kind of full with just one plate it was probably the rice which had a fantastic smell of chicken oil coconut the chicken however was just okay it was not very tender and a bit on the dry side but again the experience of eating the rice itself was so enjoyable that it added points to the chicken as well i give  stars mostly because of the price and the rice quality of the chicken and the long line does not really justify it to be a  star restaurant if i could go to singapore again this would not be on my list of must go restaurants but i would not mind dropping by and grabbing a plate,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this place has the best hainanese chicken rice i have ever had i order this dish anywhere it is available so i have had my fair share of hainanese chicken rice but this place has the best this unassuming food stand that seems to always have a line wrapping around the corner at maxwell is it the rice is so flavorful that i can eat two bowls and still want more i am not a fan of white meat due to typical dryness but when they ran out of chicken drumstick leg i had to settle for breast and to my surprise the white breast meat was tender and juicy the chicken skin is super smooth and silky i usually do not eat chicken skin but i just could not help myself during my short two days visit this is the only thing i ate more than once so this place is legit,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,overhyped hainanese chicken and rice seriously why the mad hype thanks anthony bourdain ambiance hawker style there will be a line but it moves quickly food ordered the   small order which comes with rice and steamed chicken chicken and rice were decent nothing mind blowing rice was not that fragrant the chicken was not that flavorful rating  overall it is ai right had better but for a few bucks it is not bad for lunch,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i do not know they take bland looking chicken and rice and turn it into a masterpiece i wo not lie i took some convincing once i saw the picture that let is say not appetizing but after seeing the line of the locals we decided to join in suit the wait is most definitely worth it as it is the most flavorful chicken and rice and the hot sauce sets it over the top the chicken is well seasoned and cooked stewed and the rice compliments it with a salty chicken taste do not make the mistake i almost did and try this place it is rated by anthony bourdain,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,visited this place for late lunch and had the half chicken with chicken rice it was very delicious probably the best chicken rice i have eaten during my visit the chicken was steamed nicely soft and succulent and the rice was fragrant and tasty because it is in a hawker centre be prepared for the hawker ambiance no air condition crowded share tables and long queues but worth it to try the chicken rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i did not think the menu would be that complicated so i said uhhhh  order please expecting a little help somehow i ended up with skinless chicken breast they pour a thin gravy over it and that is all you get over rice everything was bland very disappointed they are probably resting on their laurels at this point although i am not sure if it was ever deserved just press from bourdain tong fong fatt in this same maxwell food center was better at least it came with soy and chili sauce rooster rice in sf is the best haha,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,first time in singapore but steamed chicken is something i have always loved this is delicious yes it is a simple dish but it is cooked to perfection and the tender chicken was the bomb i enjoyed it without much of the orange sauce they serve on the side the rice is delicious and addictive cooked in broth with garlic and maybe a hint if ginger we also got bean sprouts and bok choy both were good i literally could eat this everyday want some right now,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,no queue the whole maxwell food centre was just so quiet at around   pm but i was not complaining since i hate queueing up for anything or was that my yelp friend tian tian hainanese chicken rice was good really good tender chicken with fragrant rice it might not be the best in singapore but i felt like i was in one of anthony bourdain is show and got to travel around the world and eat but i really here travelling the world just to eat i will remember this chicken rice whenever i have the chicken rice at home the tasteless chicken that were dry and tough even the soy sauce here tasted much better,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,as many others that travel to singapore tian tian is probably on the top of their list of must try restaurants food stalls a local friend recommended tian tian or ah tai if the line was too long here so naturally i knew i would be stopping by we had originally planned on stopping by for either lunch or dinner on monday but after checking their business hours we noticed they were closed that day seeing how we were leaving on wednesday morning we made the trek over to tian tian do not utilize the map location on yelp as it takes you to the wrong place as this is hawker stand is inside the maxwell food center for an early dinner it was a super muggy hot evening so we opted to take the food back to the hotel to enjoy in an air conditioned room we were lucky to find a short line and were in and out within  minutes we ended up ordering their half chicken along with two orders of rice and an order of their bean sprouts to our surprise the portions were huge we only ended up eating   of the chicken and maybe about   of the rice one draw back about taking the food to go is that they did not include the ginger oil and also some sweet soy sauce which is what we are accustomed to having along with our hainan chicken rice though the chicken was super tender i did not think the rice was that aromatic or flavorful despite being disappointed with the rice tian tian was   the cost of our dinner at chatterbox i think the perfect hainan chicken dinner would be the chicken at tian tian and the rice from chatterbox tian tian is still a must try when visiting singapore but i think i will try other places before coming back again,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,it was our first time at maxwell food center and from our research ahead of time we knew we wanted to try the tian tian hainanese chicken rice and we were very glad we did because it was delicious,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,location tian tian hainanese chicken rice hawker center date may  time after seeing one of my idols anthony bourdain visit this spot and knowing that we were going to be in the same area i had to go one you enter the hawker center large covered area that houses many food stalls carts you will immediately see the longest line originating from this spot is it the best food under the roof or just the spot a someone made famous get in there and find out for yourself i personally loved the dish it was quickly prepared very affordable cheap and most importantly delicious we got the simple chicken rice it comes with fresh cut chicken atop well cooked rice with some cucumber slices and a spicy side of sauce and i do mean spicy the dish was simple and the flavors were not over the top save that sauce but it really appeals to the palate add the sauce for a fiery kick if you find yourself in singapore make the hike to this spot to try the dish of the country,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,came to maxwell road hawker centre right before lunch time to stand in line for tian tian hainanese chicken rice honestly the queue was about  min max as it moves very very quickly even though the line wrapped around the stall sorry i cannot remember the price in usd but i am sure it is under  i kinda knew what i was going to get into fragrant oily rice and soft boiled chicken with skin garlic ginger spicy sauce and dark soy sauce to mix together what can i say i am not a huge fan of boiled room temp chicken now deep fry that bad boy and we talkin about a real good meal lol j k one persons opinion does not really mean much my palate is not the same as anyone else is so we all have to try out dishes for ourselves right how about i share some pics,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,it was good but i just cannot give  until i refine my ability to critique cold chicken and rice i am still working on this and will update as necessary i did however find many other dishes at other stand that i will be glad to offer more fine tuned reactions,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian is chicken rice lives up to the reputation cold tender if not a tad gelatinous chicken is a little challenging for my western pallet but i dig it the rice is worthy of a dish on its own however everything on the dish is ancillary to the chili sauce whatever you do ask for more chili sauce,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,there was little line when i came at pm the chicken rice was good but not great the chicken was mostly tender but a bit on the dry side,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,amid the sea of hawker stalls that make up the maxwell road food center one stands out to even the casual observer it alone has a line queue apparantely tian tian has people waiting for its food virtually all the time i visited during what i thought would be a between meal lull in foot traffic around pm and sure enough there were still about  people waiting ahead of me no other stall in the center had a queue the reason is obvious after you taste their chicken rice how they infuse so much flavor into the chicken meat from a boiling steaming cooking process is remarkable the bowl of clear broth that comes with it has a similar flavor and is quite nice the vegetable with oyster sauce dish that i also ordered was surprising delicious baby bok choy infused with thse same wonderful flavors found in the chicken and all of it came to a little over s   us   for food quality that many much more expensive asian restuarants cannot match a hint for fellow tourists hawker stalls like this do not provide napkins and to use the wash rooms to clean up will cost you ten cents exact change helps also tian tian does not sell beverages for something with an asian flair that is easily accessible to everyone is palate i recommend the sugar cane juice from the stall directly across from tian tian,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,if you choose to come here for their hainan chicken be prepared to queue up for a little while when we visited maxwell center there were numerous hainan chicken joints inside but none of them had nearly as long of a line as tian tian did though it is a typical small sized stall that you would expect at any hawker centre in singapore they have got enough manpower that the division of labor with such little space is impressive order after order is rolled out so efficiently that your mouth just waters as the queue gets shorter if it is   of you i highly suggest grabbing half a chicken and  rice bowls soup is included along with all the condiments it is not hainan chicken without all the sauces the chicken is so damn succulent that you will want to eat it until the very last bit of meat and veins that you are nearly close to the bone marrow if you know some chinese or getting a bit rusty this is your chance to speak it as some of the ladies passing you the food do not know too much english maybe some singlish though haha and do not forget to snap a picture of the food porn before you start digging in,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,review for nov touted as one of the best places for chicken rice i would say i was a little disappointed and unfortunately they also ran out of dark meat however was a good first spot for chicken and rice in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,first the hainanese chicken is wonderful however the time waiting in line is not worth the differential to other hainanese chicken you can get elsewhere put another way it is good but you can get something pretty comparable elsewhere with no wait at the same price or cheaper very good food but seems a bit overhyped in my opinion,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,large hainanese chicken rice is not much larger than the medium chicken was a little cold and was pretty bland even with the chili sauce overrated do not listen to anthony bourdain in this case,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,at the maxwell food center this is definitely the most popular stall to get lunch at it is really good taste wise and price wise given how delicious and aromatic the chicken and rice is definitely worth the stop,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian seemed to be made popular by anthony bourdain so i had to try it overall i would say it was good would i return likely if i were showing guests around since this restaurant has gained popularity because of bourdain and that is why people want to try it out chicken was moist and flavorful as people say rice had good flavor as well the sauce provided was good but i like the chicken rice meal on its own   for a small if you are with a group order a whole or half and share i would say that other places are just as good without the hype also then you do not have a wait even though this line at tian tian moves give or take quickly tip have your ready because they try to hurry you along tip expect a line and to wait at least a little,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken rice is ok but the  year old man in cap is a total trash ask me to bring the chilli plate back when i bought another extra chicken rice this is real,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,yep i am a fan of there delicious haninanese chicken rice lines can get long go in off peek times if you can,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i am definitely not surprised that this place has more yelp reviews than any other place in singapore this place is heaven no joke i came to singapore to eat i wanted to try all the hainan chicken rice out there before coming to tian tian i had about   different hainan chicken rice from places all over singapore honestly they were good but not amazing i got to the stall at around am there were only a few people in front of me for two people we shared half a chicken and rice the chicken was so tender and flavorful and the rice omg you can literally just eat the rice by itself it was so fragrant all the other chicken rice we ate we ad leftover rice but this place we cleaned the plate in less than  minutes also the spicy sauce is sooooo amazing i love spicy food and it had the perfect kick it was so good that we took two more orders to go with us to sentosa to eat on the beach do not judge me my only complaint is that the chicken had a lot of bones other places made it with chicken breast and no bones so it was a lot easier to eat and less fatty if i ever come back to singapore it would be for tian tian nothing else i miss it already,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,came here straight after trying the now infamous soya sauce chicken and rice hawker stand and i prefer this one i know they are completely different in taste but the wait here is much much shorter it was also past lunch time when i came and i think the chicken is equally as tender the dish here also is not swimming in oil like the other place and just had clean simple flavors i have been here  years ago and it was just as good then as it is now just a word of advice ask them if you want to get more sauces because they do not like it when you go and try to serve yourself another dish of it,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,queue goes pretty fast even with the long lines b c he is like the soup nazi you get what you get no extra toppings sauces unless you specifically ask for it ginger hot sauce cilantro ect or buy the whole chicken the neighboring stalls that serves chicken and rice gives you the all condiment spices w out any attitude not a fan of chicken and rice but have to admit tian tian chicken is pretty good,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,was not that impressed especially after the hype in a matter of just a few days i had sampled  different hainenese chicken rice places some reputable like this and others just random and was not impressed at all some of the random places had much more flavorful rice but wonder is this place is just riding off the reputation now a friend from singapore agreed that it is nothing special i was pretty disappointed but oh well,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,overall the longest lines are reserved for tian tian and overall the food was good i waited about  minutes in line in order to order and get my food they have it down to a science i e efficient so make sure you take a look at the menu before you get to the woman who takes your order pay in one place move down the line to another place to pick up your food i ordered chicken and rice while the chicken was moist i think that i like the rice even more very very fragrant chicken smell and tastebok choy in oyster sauce while this was good it was actually more expensive than the chicken and rice itself next time i would skip the veggies and fill up with other good food in this centre overall tian tian met my expectations but i would not say that i was blown away still it is probably a must eat while in singapore for tourists,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i may not be in the majority but while i liked the chicken rice i was not falling out of my seat eating it either it is a ok though simple warm a slightly sweet sauce this chicken and rice has a home cooked taste that makes it great to eat when you are looking to fill up on a staple without much fuss i liked it but did not love it,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i am hoping this is the one located at maxwell center in chinatown this spot is especially popular because their chicken and rice beat gordan ramsay at a competition rightfully so because the chicken non broiled was tasty requiring no sauce or ketchup for that matter it did come with an orangey chili sauce for additional dipping if you choose the rice was fragrant and went well with the chicken wait was not long at all most likely because i went in the afternoon after the lunch rush,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken and rice here was delicious and at only  for a medium plate very satisfying the line was not bad during lunch time at only about  minutes,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the best chicken rice in the whole world it is even worth to come here when you have just an stopover at singapore airport it takes about  minutes taking the mrt from changi to get here just hop of at stop  and go down maxwell road what you see is what you get chicken and rice this dish is so tender and flavored you will love it,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this place is overhyped the chicken rice is average the line was pretty long when i arrived at around  on a weekday but the stall uncles were very efficient and the line moved very fast chicken meat abit dry texture is not great rice fragrant and moistchilli sauce good typical chicken rice chilli sauce the chicken rice is drizzled with some sauce and the sauce is too salty you can probably request to not have the sauce also the soup was not provided till asked soup is very bland the stall owner also requested for us to hold the plates in our hands instead of using the trays to hold the plates i went with a friend and we had bought  plates,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,it was as if clouds took rice form and were cooked in an amazing broth of just right seasoning that is what the rice is like from tiantian having first tried the chicken rice in chinatown i had an okay benchmark of what it could be compared to this little hawker stall or rather two hawker stalls lived up to the hype the rice was flavorful fragrant and indeed was eaten by itself for a few moments before realizing there was a half chicken waiting to be consumed also paired with the soy and chili sauce the chicken and the rice worked together wonderfully and left me to wonder if this was better than rd and th is own chicken and rice my conclusion it holds its weight a must try if visiting singapore not just because a celebrity chef said so but because food should be considered a way to get to know a new culture intimately and with this simple dish you definitely feel at home even thousands of miles away,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,forget what anthony bourdain said all he did was overhype the chicken and rice and create a crazy long line out the door i stupidly waited like a gullible fool for an ordinary dish that i could have gotten anywhere at least it was cheap only   sgd for a plate of mediocrity,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken rice was good however one star off for not having visceral and another star off because it does not compare to ah tai chicken rice which is the stall next door we found the rice at tian tian to be too salty and the chicken was not as tender and juicy as ah tais ah tai is is also cheaper and he used to be the chef at tian tian,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,had to try this because it is so famous but i much prefer kiat ocha hainanese chicken rice in chiang mai thailand,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,came for lunch got the chicken and rice plate it was okay very simple flavors the orange sauce that cane with had a nice spicy kick to it would come back and eat again,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,just another hawker stall nope this one has been knighted by anthony bourdain the  minute lines will tip you off that this chicken and rice joint is something special but how is the food the hainanese chicken is just ok but nearly all of this type of chicken is just ok because it is all about the rice and sauce the meat is smooth evenly cooked relatively clean devoid of fatty sinews and bone spurs for this type of chicken the rice is very good but not bursting with flavor as the pro chef is review suggests still its soft juicy and fragrant this stall is orange colored sauce is legitimately hot not as hot as something like say a halal guys red sauce in manhattan but still quite heated fyi the singaporeans do not seem to rock the ginger green onion sauces that them cantonese folks like overall it is about average and it makes wonder if i should be letting a gwai lo in cantonese tell me what is good chinese food,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i am going to say this is the best chicken rice i have ever had ever on a recent trip to singapore i visited twice in a  hour period and now compare every other chicken rice meal to tian tian the lines may be daunting but they move quickly and the staff here move swiftly to fulfil orders and have you on your way with mounds of steaming rice silky chicken perfectly balances chili sauce and broth in moments put a member of your group in line while the others hunt down drinks and a table,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,such a simple concept but it is so darn delicious i had to try chicken rice after my boyfriend continuously talked about it we made our way to the hawker center that anthony bourdain visited as well evident by the huge photo of him by tian tian is stand it was around  pieces of tender chicken with chicken fat poured over it served with white rice and hot sauce they give you a choice between the small large place but by the looks of my large plate the small one must be meant for a mouse overall great local food even if it does not really constitute singaporean food and great taste i wish i could have another and another and another plate,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,checked out this joint on a long layover in singapore and boy one of the best chicken rice amazing rice so delicious,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,ok so this is the famous place at maxwell food center and it turns out this is pretty delicious cheap eats in sg better yet have it with some ice cold large bottles of tiger beer from the place facing it delicious,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,stars to this bourdain recommended michelin bib gourmand winning food stall the star of the show is definitely the rice which is fragrant and teeming with flavor and that complements the chicken very well there is a huge huge line but i guess thats what comes with fame,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i mean it is a legend for a reason this was my first chicken and rice experience but not my last and i will remember it fondly the chicken itself was moist and tender not the highest of quality i feel heng ji at chinatown is higher quality but not poor by any means the rice certainly shines and was delicious was here on a saturday evening and the line was not too long the food centre was not too busy either and i got a table no problem,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,located inside the maxwell food court just a short walk from the chinatown mrt station long line so the best time to go is before lunch or after the lunch hour crowd the line moves very fast and the service very efficient and organized the chicken is very moist tendet and juicy the rice fluffy and perfectly seasoned the bean sprout was cooked just right must definitely try the tian tian chicken rice is you are in the area or when visiting singapore simple dish but so good great to have a good quality meal at a very affordable price highly recommended,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,simply delicious  must try place to eat if ever in singapore cheapest michelin star restaurant i have ever ate at probably the cheapest,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i went there very early at   on sat and the queue was not so long which was just  min for my turn to order the chicken rice is the popular one on their list esp for single tourist i love the rice very much but the chicken is normal not too much diffence against others that is why one star missing,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i was told that i absolutely had to try this place in singapore so my friend and i stopped by the hawker center to give it a try yes the line is long but do not worry it moves pretty quickly before you get in line to order it is good to walk around the hawker center and browse at what other folks are eating look at the plates to identify which stall the food comes from this will give you a better understanding about the food options they have whole chicken half chicken single serving with rice veggies etc since my friend and i were trying lots of different stalls for lunch we ordered a single serving for each of us the chicken is super soft and smooth definitely not something you can find in the states who can complain about   for chicken rice and soup,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,not sure what the hype is about i found it a ok the rice was not the best and most fragrant i have tasted and neither was the chicken which i honestly found too oily they sell out towards the tail end of the evening so come early if you want your fix,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i was all about chicken rice tian tian the entire time i was in singapore when i finally had the chance to try it out it just turned out to be a ok the chicken was fine but the rice was a bit hard one notch away from the uncooked categorization i ended up getting chicken rice three stalls down at ah tai which i liked so much better it was what i thought the experience would have been like and oh maybe it is just me but i thought it was weird being forced to stare at anthony bourdain is picture while i was standing in line the hype train is strong,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the best thing about this place was the flavorful rice but other than that i feel like i have had better chicken and for much less the locals must know of a tastier hidden treasure because i did not see any locals in line a majority of the people were visitors who knew of this stall is existence because it was approved by anthony bourdain,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,overrated we came here cause a lot of social media is recommending this place but the reality is much different long lines and the chicken came out a bit cold the taste was not any different than most chicken rice places,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,my favorite place for chicken rice we totally lucked out because we never waited the two times we ate here must be because we eat during off peak times but better for us because it made me love this place even more they give a generous portion of chicken which is way it wins in the chicken rice war love the ginger sauce as well i add the thick soy sauce to the rice and mix it together yum one of my favorite meals in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,after hearing all the hype abut this place award winning chef when they sell out they just close shop the line is always a mile long etc just sets up this joint for a harder fall situated in the famous maxwell hawker market it was not too hard to find yes just look for the stall with the longest line with about  people in front of me i decided to just take a number and fall into line when it was time to order the register lady was soup nazi like and there were signs instructing how to order and to get your cash ready puleeze i got the half chicken and chicken rice first mistake i had to ask for soy sauce second mistake they did not provide a fresh ground ginger oil condiment third the chicken and rice tasted just okay not mind blowing,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,yum we went during an offtime and there was still along line the chicken is cooked to perfection it literally melts in your mouth the rice is very fragrant and well prepared as well this is a must try if you are visiting singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,very good chicken rice here try the half chicken and rice be sure not to let the cool chicken broth with the half chicken go to waste i think it tastes best poured onto the rice love the garlic chili sauce i am learning that there really is not a best chicken rice in singapore there is either chicken rice made properly or chicken rice not made properly it is made very properly here comfort food at its finest,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,they occupy two stalls first stall the corner one is to take order and make payment then you proceed to the nd stall to pass them your receipt verdict there are better ones out there this is too overrated chicken is dry but generous amount rice is so so but chilli tasted pretty fresh tangy and spicy on the whole did not expect this much hyped chicken rice to taste so less than mediocre,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,since hearing the tale of how the hawkers at this restaurant famously defeated gordon ramsay in a cook off battle i have been clamouring to try this stall chicken rice is my favourite singaporean dish so i badly wanted this one to blow me away the queue was pretty intimidating around lunch time but it moved quickly enough the ordering process itself was bit of a nightmare the woman at the till was very brusque and seemed more intent with moving me along understandable but in her haste she ended up getting my order wrong and pointing me to the wrong collection queue and then scolding me later for not being at the right one all the logistics aside the chicken rice was good but not amazing my chicken was tender but there were way too many bones the rice was fragrant but again not unexpected with a chicken rice dish at most other stalls you also have to order your vegetables separately  for a plate that can be shared between  which was slightly annoying since most places do everything together for a cheaper price most of the people queuing up were also tourists which can sometimes be a telling sign as to whether a restaurant is more hype than substance in this case i am afraid it is,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,located inside maxwell is food court is a gem there are so many hawker stands it is hard to figure out which one to visit a must visit if you want authentic hainan chicken rice the staff is super nice they are very honest and helpful we asked for a whole chicken thinking it would be small portions but the lady asked how many people will be eating when we said two she said half chicken is more than enough the rice is super flavorful we ordered to go and the one complaint i had is they did not pack any ginger sauce when i think of hainan chicken rice i think ginger sauce and yummy rice for me the star of the dish is the rice need to add the ginger sauce the chicken was juicy and tender we ordered bean sprouts ans that was delicious it tasted very much like home cooked meal amazing cannot wait to go back this time i will make sure i get the ginger sauce,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,when i reached maxwell food center at around   am there were at least   people in front of me there are two sections of the store one for paying and order bigger plates the other one collection all i could say is yum the rice has interesting flavours and the chicken was tender well cooked i was impressed by the overall deliciousness of the chicken rice this is a must try place especially for tourist,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this is definitely the best hainan chicken i have ever had i ordered  drum stick chicken with rice i like the dark meat and a plate of veggies the chilli sauce really gives it an extra pizzazz queue was long but it moved quickly i liked it so much i came back for another meal the day i was leaving,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,very popular place with long line this place has pretty solid chicken rice but definitely not the best i have ever had rice had good flavor chicken could have been juicer and more flavorful do not really understand what the hype is about,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,it really was awfully good i would go more for the roast chicken and not lukewarm but when in rome or here singapore do as they do using that criterion this was near perfection,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken was really soft and the rice was flavorful came on a awkward time so the line was only  min i will make a trip here no matter where i am in singapore worth the visit when your here,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,anthony bourdain made it a must go place to eat it is always long queue in the morning then closed so early when the chicken are sold out i lived in oasia hotel which is  min walk to maxwell food court,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i can literally eat this everyday there may be better chicken rices out there but if you are risk adverse then come here and take a seat you will not be disappointed this is a tried and true spot even by the locals i got a medium order and wished i had ordered a large be adventurous and try the orange ginger sauce,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,my cousin who lived in singapore for a while highly recommended tian tian is chicken rice so took our hungry selves for a late lunch was shocked to see a long line to the counter and from what i heard from my cousin that was quite typical of singapore especially the good ones we waited in line and really hoped that the chicken rice would be worth the long wait i saw a number of people walking with their chicken rice plates and quite honestly they did not look appetizing at all finally got the counter and ordered their much famed chicken rice they drop a bowl of rice on the plate some sauce in it and chicken breast slices on the top and a few slices on cucumber on the side would never imagine that something that looks so simple cab taste so good wow wow wow i cannot stop raving about this dish it is so flavorful worth it the long wait was totally worth it,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tasted the chicken from this stall a few times before it was recently awarded a michelin bib gourmand the chicken was succulent tender and juicy in addition the layer of fat from the skin gave this really lovely richness that complemented the meat really well the rice was flaky and smooth enough to eat on its own a solid experience no wonder it defeated gordon ramsay,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,no doubts this will have your bucket list of singapore chicken rice checked while this or chatterbox chicken rice might be a representative of the chicken rice in singapore it really is not personally feel that even within maxwell market there is so many other chicken rice stalls to go to minus the long waiting time minus the expensive prices for a plate of chicken rice minus the inconsistent portions and tastes minus the hype worth it or not if your singaporean you know where to eat lah two doors down and a similar branding appears with more value for money chicken rice consistently good and tastes almost  similar no queue if your not singaporean and desperately want some instagram worthy looking food well here it is,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,who would have thought that a dish so simple could be so delicious and comforting had to try some hainan chicken rice after watching anthony bourdain on no reservations rave about tian tian luckily our hotel was literally walking distance right across from the maxwell food court so i was ready to eat this every single day it was that delicious for   singapore dollars which was basically equivalent to  us you get a pretty decent portion of chicken and rice plus a bowl of the chicken broth the rice smells heavenly the chicken is moist but pretty bland by itself however it is all about mixing the chili sauce and brown sauce with your chicken my goodness there is usually a line so be prepared for a wait but there at tian tian the service is pretty fast definitely a must have while visiting singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,chicken rice and veg is my very favorite combo so i loved this was not thrilled that the chicken was cold or that they ran out of chinese broccoli but loved the dish regardless id eat here often if it was not across the world from me,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,some of my local friends recommended me to try on a weekend instead of the weekdays to avoid the crowd so was here on a weekend but the queue was snaking long oh well it was worth the wait authentic local the rice and steamed chicken was flavourful gotta try the chili sauce with it only found the chicken soup to be a tad too oily try it,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,dear anthony bourdain with no reservations i am writing due to my fair lady who has been one of your many fans for the longest time for your video highlighting the chicken rice experience in singapore before her visit to singapore she sent me a link to your video i am sorry i have never cared enough to watch any of your shows even though i am practically always on food network and made me watch it so that i could bring her there well that is the thing that video and your stupid picture on the stall makes people think that the stall is freaking good because you approved it oh please it is quite obvious in the video that you would have never tried chicken rice if the crowd did not boo the living crap out of you which i have done since i first watched one of your shows so i must say as i did to my fair lady that i knew of tian tian way before you even highlighted it in your story singaporeans know their food and will never need your picture or approval to seal in the awesomeness of a particular stall for example i just look for a freaking line that is longer than your achievements and know that the food will be great just like on the day that i binged on two orders of chicken rice to try both the roast and the standard steamed version i tried the porridge with a line that took nearly  minutes before i got to order that did not have your face on their stall for the record do us all non fans of yours a favor before we bash you even more and tell the truth to your fans such as my fair lady that your approval of this stall is worthless because your opinion on asian food or all other local food just does not count not to mention if the crowd did not boo you i am  sure you would not have tried chicken rice you fail tian tian just wins enough to grace you with their attention so you can make a buck by featuring it get a real chef job sincerely chickenrice fanyelp,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this is my absolute favorite place for hainan chicken and rice i dream about this place i had this a few years ago and i live to far to be able to eat it all the time i remembered that the first day when we arrived in singapore we ate here i was so glad this place was literally right across the street from where we stayed i think i ate here  times before we left the chicken is perfectly cooked and the sauce that you use to dip your chicken is amazing the rice is not oily at all either tian tian see you in a few weeks,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken rice here is quite good but so are most of the other stalls nearby if you are not in a hurry and like lines go ahead and wait but plenty other great chicken rice options in maxwell if you are in a hurry first time i tried to go here i was new to singapore and tricked by a very similar named stall wtih a similar sign that chicken rice was great too ha,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this was the only steamed chicken rice i tried in singapore so i cannot say for sure that it is the best chicken rice in sg but it was definitely quite amazing the chicken is juicy and flavorful and i really loved the light sauce on it which had an amazing taste the rice is fluffy and lightly tasty i did not really love the soy sauce chili sauce to add on top so adding those did mess up the dish a little for me but didnt change how amazing the chicken was it is simple and lovely and perfectly cooked a must have dish when you are in sg,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,in los angeles there is only  restaurant that serves a respectable hainan chicken so that is really all i know about hainan chicken on my trip to singapore i was determined to find one that is clearly better after   restaurants and stands at hawker markets and food courts i was starting to think that my go to hainan chicken rice restaurant in los angeles is as good as it was going to get other than the fact that the price in la is higher than that in singapore luckily i marked up tian tian which is highly regarded by anthony bourdain and gordon ramsay and made a point to come try this wow the chicken was silky clean tasting yet flavorful the rice smelled amazing and tasted even better the red sauce added a special kick my girlfriend and i devoured half of a chicken and took  chicken rice plates to go this is what singapore is all about and i can finally return home happy knowing that the hainan chicken in se asia is not an unfortunate hype,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,holy cow thank you anthony bourdain for telling the world about this place the line is never ending but damnnnn this place is the bomb once you finally get to the front order that chicken with rice the chicken is good but the chicken flavored rice is the star of the show i can eat that rice all day long,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,do not be deterred by the line it moves fast absolutely worth the wait there were about  ppl in line ahead of us and we still had our food in  minutes do not miss out on the vegetables in oyster sauce in addition to the chicken and rice delish there is also this coconut milk shake place across the way thai tea shake was perfect to sip on while standing in line for our food,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,super flavorful chicken rice as recommended by many locals and other visitors very simple yet tasty the garlic chili dipping sauce was a great accompaniment and i asked for the thick black soy sauce which apparently is for those in the know luckily i have friends in the know long line was intimidating but it went super fast so it did not feel long at all definitely recommended,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,if you are a fan of anthony bourdain and his show no reservations then you have probably heard of tian tian and their famous chicken rice when i first came to singapore my  to do was to eat chicken rice from tian tian and their stall in maxwell food centre i popped in real early as i wanted to beat the queue as soon as the stall opened i was first in line i ordered the standard chicken rice set and after  minute of waiting a serving of chicken rice soup and garlic chili sauce was waiting for me after i found an empty table i threw some garlic chili on top of my dish and dug in the moment the mix of chili rice and chicken hit my tongue was like ecstasy it was as if i had lost my virginity all over again okay maybe not quite the same plenty of time has passed after my first time there and i can proudly admit that i have eaten the chicken rice there at least  more times after that whenever i have visitors i always make sure to take them to tian and tian and have them experience it for themselves it is a must,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,we came only once but boy was it worth it got here early around am and there was a short line already and it only grew as the time went by i would order half a chicken and separate rice if you can for a better value but the chicken are deboned and with a drizzle of soy sauce to perfect the rice is amazing as well but it could use some ginger but that is just me,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,amazing after hearing about it from a friend bc of anthony bourdain i had to try it it is a no frills hawker stand in a food court of hawker stalls so do not go for the ambiance or environment but if you want one of the best chicken plates you will ever have this is your spot i ate two and contemplated a third most delicious chicken with aromatic rice so good combine it with a juice from the stall across the hall and it will be one of your best meals in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,located at the maxwell hawker center this chicken rice stall may just be all hype due to anthony bourdain is episode in singapore the line for this stall is usually very long on the weekends but i was able to go on a weekday with no wait yes the chicken rice was great juicy and plump however any other chicken rice stall around singapore has similar chicken rice that tastes just as great it was   sgd at tian tian for the white chicken rice no soup given however i am able to find some places around singapore that sells chicken rice that is just as great for   sgd and they give you soup give this place a try if you like but if the line is extremely long i say you should try chicken rice at another stall,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,since long time ago very famous hainan chicken rice restaurant not only local many tourists visit here,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,had the  chicken rice asked for coriander leaves and guess what the owner said  one does not come with it really all chicken rice must have it no matter what too bad oh and no soup too anyway the chicken meat was not as tender or smooth as my expectation although their chilli sauce is good,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the hype did not live up to the expectation in terms of ice bath chickens i have definitely had better such as at nong is khao man gai in portland or i got half a chicken for  and the dark meat was fine and dandy the white meat was a bit on the drier and tasteless side the chicken rice and hot sauce were delicious though but not enough to carry this dish to a  stars and up,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i was expecting so much from this place maybe because my preference is skewed and the singapore style is different maybe because it was so over hyped best hainan chicken in singapore and considering this is the must try place i got the hainan chicken and rice the rice was okay i the chicken was okay too when it came out it was like warm at most the chicken was not juicy and flavorful as what i expected,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,famous for its chicken rice that some people call the best in singapore it is indeed a great place to enjoy this delicious and typical singaporean dish all the more so as the price is very affordable price less than sgd however i was a bit disappointed after the excellent reviews i read about it the chicken was indeed not bad but there were little pieces of bones inside of it i never had them in other chicken rice stalls i tried in singapore and the rice was not exceptional i guess it was okay but i had better rice in other stalls and it is still a big thing in that dish so overall it is a good place to eat but maybe not worth the long queue,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,sticky but it is not glutinous rice tender soft chicken meat and speciality sauce tiantianchickenrice chickenrice foodporn sg,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this was this was the only stall that had a line a long long line i imagine that this is partly because of the celebrity hype and advertising nevertheless i waited it was good the chicken was tender and the rice was flavorful was it worth the wait not really sure there were other stalls selling chicken rice that looked the same however there were locals waiting for the tiantian i asked one guy in line and he assured me this was better than the others for s  i got a huge plate of rice and chicken with a few slices of cucumber and sauces plus a bowl of broth all in all a really good filling meal for a small amount of money try the fried bananas at stall next row over delicious,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,hawker stalls are sort of the thing in singapore and this is the place to be since anthony bourdain gordon ramsay etc have been here chicken rice was amazing full of flavor rich and creamy from the chicken broth but the chicken itself was not spectacular sort of slimy and not a ton of meat mostly bones boo my best rec get the chicken rice from tian tian then meander a few stalls down to add some soy sauce chicken to your rice awwesome mix,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,so i am joining this long list of reviews to comment on the fare here after gordon ramsey is tour of singapore this place is more popular than ever i used to remember coming on particular days of the week is it monday and the stall is not even open at all seems like they dictate the terms where you guys can or cannot taste their chicken rice seems over rated to me after all i came down on a weekday evening and was pleasantly surprised that they were still open at around  proceeded to order a plate and it did not come with soup the chicken is a little tough as compared to those i have eaten at other places the chili however is absolutely delicious not to hot and sweet enough for my liking i went back to take another helping of it oh i did not see them providing dark soy sauce too the rice is absolutely normal there were some cucumber hidden beneath the chicken the experience was underwhelming and i am sure the other stalls around like ah tai are already biting at their heels in contending for chicken rice hegemony,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,yes long cue about  people in front of me waited about   minutes a got the famous chicken with rice ok it is very tender but is it the best as people say someone told me that their quality has gone down after being on many magazines i am afraid i would rather go to boon tong kee,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,comment very good very affordable look at the long line to prove itfood good quality ingredients good portion size tasty chicken tasty saucesservice great service fast friendly super nicecleanliness the food is clean the eating area around it not so much recommendations chicken rice extra ginger saucessuggestions bigger operation,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,do expect a long line as the singaporeans all some to gather to what is supposedly the best this is a perfect example of things not living up to the hype the wait can be fairly long even though they work fairly fast and be prepared that they may run out of food before you make it to the counter the service can at best be described as efficient but a more accurate description may be half rude i guess they can afford to as they are so popular the food is chicken rice and i will admit that i do fail to see the greatness of this dish although i have had a few decent ones this one barely qualifies as decent as it does lack some of the freshness and also appear to use some chicken that is not the highest quality the rice was however very fresh and tasted really nicely there will however not be any repeat visits for me,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i still crave this in my sleep visited my hometown this summer after several years and the first thing i craved was chicken rice the national dish of singapore and rightly so its chicken is tender the rice is cooked with the broth and all the sauces ginger and dark sweet soy sauce must be eaten together to get the best out of the meal tian tian is famous for having one of the best chicken rice but honestly everywhere around singapore you can find a delicious plate of chicken rice too bad it is hard to find here in california,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i thought it was cute that tian tian hawker stall gave out a number along with the printed receipt guess they are that popular and famous that they have one window to pay and another to get your food when most hawker stallls are usually a one or two man show the chicken rice here along with the one in far east plaza is supposedly the most popular in singapore for chiken rice but the blue sign hawker stall on the second floor of golden shoe hawker is just as good and my coworkes and i frequent this one more often as it is right next to our work in raffles place cannot choose all three are good with juicy chicken and fragrant rice i always get the steamed chicken rice with no skin with extra hot sauce,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,been eating at tian tian for years the queue is constant but moves quite quickly the chicken is tender and succulent and the rice can be eaten on its own chilli is very good but may be a little hot and spicy to some,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i had to go here due to the infamy gained from bourdain and i usually agree with his assessment this place is good and on par with chatterbox at   the price now i have only been here since they expanded but here is what i got rice is more flavorful than chatterbox but not by much chicken was dry and full of bones bourdain mentioned this was a go to spot with chicken that did not need the sauce but tian tian put it on anyway on my visit the chicken was dry if you are visiting and pass through the foreigner checkpoint at chatterbox this is the next logical step to get an authentic hawker table in chinatown if you want the best and can make your way to yishun jiefuji is my top pick for best in the island nation otherwise this place is a solid   stars,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,making a complicated dish look simple this place earns the reputation it has because it maintains its consistency despite the pressure to accommodate long line ups every single day not to say there are not other great chicken rice options in the city or even in maxwell hawker itself but this place deserves the recognition,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i tried over  chicken rice eateries in singapore and this is by far my  favorite the chicken is so tender and delicious that i would not mind having it everything go early as they close their stall when everything is sold as i got there once at  pm and the staff were cleaning up since everything was sold out even though the maxwell food center where the stall is located closes at pm,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,yes it really is that good and yet so simple when i went to singapore i thought i needed hours of research to find the food hot spots of the city wrong i thought open table zagat and trip advisor would sort the lot wrong all you need to do is visit the hawker malls and look for the longest lines so i qued up here not even knowing what i was ordering till i was rd in line i have had this dish before and never got it till now tian tian chicken is prefect as is the rice and chili sauce it can not be describled it simply must be experienced,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,came to this well publicized tian tian hainanese chicken rice in general it is worth the trip and the taste did impress me price is decent about s   per plate here is my two cents  rice alone taste great lives up to it is name taste great to eat even by itself chicken alone is bland but texture is good i guess the favor has gone to either the rice or the chicken oil chicken with chicken oil yes the gravy is solely chicken oil taste came in great the chicken favor are all in the chicken oil chilli sauce are not hot and has some lime and garlic be cautious if you hate garlic chicken chicken oil rice chilli sauce heaven lastly expect long line especially during lunch time for about  mins,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,really cheap eat we had ordered a chicken rice to share and the only thing we did wrong was not ordered an extra rice to go with it as i am not a big meat eater all i wanted was the rice the rice was so flavourful definitely worth the hype to come here we were lucky and showed up just before the crowd cannot wait to come back,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,oh obi one anthony boiurdain i have once again followed in your footsteps braved the lines and supped at the source of all things good about chicken and rice singapore is national obsession is best done here this amazingly simple but yet complex dish burst full of robust chicken flavor it has all been said before only for those who have not been to singapore you cannot understand it until you have made your way to singapore and in the world of chicken and rice and the lines that follow as yoda says there is no try only do,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,one of my favourite chicken rice stalls in singapore my go to place whenever i crave chicken rice for lunch do watch out for the long lines though if you love chilli make sure you ask for more,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,for being one of the top rated hainan chicken place in sg rice was really good sauce was average chicken was not good lucky there was no line had way better chicken rice at a no name khao man gai place in chiang mai a week earlier,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the line for this place are ridiculous but luckily they have a corner stall where the line can naturally curve around and form outside the hawker center i do not know much about chicken rice but with my singaporean husband i naturally get dragged to all the so called famous food stalls and restaurants tian tian was no different highly reviewed by anthony bourdain which draws in the tourist crowd like myself but locals eat there too i think we must have waited for half an hour for the food but that is probably our fault for strolling in there right at lunch time on a weekend after staking out my table while the husband finally makes it through the long line i get to try the famous chicken rice it was delicious it was gently cooked which some might think is slimy but i have never had chicken so tender the chickens are young so therefore on the small side but how else will you get chicken meat to be so soft if it were not young and probably less processed then the chickens we have in the u s the sauces are the highlight must douse everything in lots of sauce lesson learned try to come before  especially on a weekend but i do not think crowds can be avoided here only minimized,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,there was a loong line for this place ever since anthony bourdain said this spot was awesome but it moved pretty quickly i think i waited around  minutes while i was waiting i kept seeing people walk away with the chicken and rice there is enough pictures of em on yelp as it is and i kept thinking that is it it does not even look good and nope it was not i guess the rice was good but the chicken was pretty bland eh it is cheap just like all the hawker food in singapore but i would not wait to eat here again there was so many other great food in the other food stands,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i think bourdain really sums it all chicken rice so fragrant and delicious it can be eaten on its own the rice is good everything else is forgettable what is wrong with the chicken it is so bland even with their special sauce i cannot help but think there must be something wrong with my palette maybe that is how singaporeans and the rest of the world likes it to me i will take thai chicken rice and or hong kong style hainanese chicken rice on any given day,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,stars i did not really need to look up online to find out where to eat at the maxwell food center i just needed to find the stalls that had a line and this one definitely had a line i enjoyed the hainan chicken rice here ended up ordering half a chicken and boy was it large in size usually when you order half a chicken you would be lucky that it would ever come in this size this is probably a chicken that was fed hormones anti biotics or something because it was huge usually organic non anti biotics chickens do not get this big so that is just my speculation the sauce that was drenched all over the chicken might have been a bit much would have preferred no drenching of the chicken it did not add much to the flavor and it just make more wet than it needs to be the chicken was very tender and juicy both the dark meat and the white meat rice was very well done full of flavor i would definitely come here again if i am in singapore again for my hainan chicken rice cravings but sadly i do not think it is the best hainan chicken rice i have ever had i think places in hong kong did a better job but regardless if i am in the area i would still come back and yes like all stalls at a hawker center it is cash only,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,massive amount of msg tasted and seen very off putting i guess it really depends on what type of chicken you like but if you are a tourist and or have never had chicken rice before there are much better examples of awesome naturally cooked and flavoured chicken rice,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i have not tried many c r places but this is definitely the best i have had so far the differences are subtle but mainly i think its the flavor of the rice and overall freshness likely driven at least partially by the demand that sets this place apart lines can be long but they move fast the problem is they often run out of food,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,they are famous for their chicken and rice supposedly in part because of anthony bourdain the queue line was long even on a sunday around   but moves relative quickly and for   sgd the chicken rice dish is probably one of the least expensive dish you can buy at this hawker center and at that price the serving portion of chicken is not particularly large but you do get plenty of rice to fill your belly up as for the famous chicken the  or  slices are soft moist and flavorful though i do wonder how much of that tasty flavor was from the broth they spoon on the dish before serving i am giving tian tian  stars if this dish was served at another hawker stand i would prob give it  stars but eating out is never just about food alone and factor in the whole experience of waiting in a long line along with everyone else ordering chicken rice that deserves one more star in my opinion,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken is so smooth and perfectly cooked the price point is just right but the taste a bit bland for me i have had better hainanese chicken in the us but it is worth the trip we went on a saturday prior to the lunch rush perhaps the line was not too long and was very efficient the best time is probably to show up a pm lots of people were ordering half chickens but we wanted to try other things so we just had  hainese chicken dishes with rice they also try to upsell you with a plate of veggies,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,it is hard to find a good plate of hainan chicken rice in the states the best are savoy and green zone in san gabriel here at tian tian the food is hawker style no fancy platings or decorations on the dishes just plain good chicken and rice the rice was very flavorful good enough to be eaten alone and the chicken was very tender i usually do not like to eat the skin but with tian tian is it did not even matter price for a plate is about us  per person jonasapproved,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,anthony bourdain is either a liar a moron or both there is no way in hell the chicken rice dish is anything more than what it is bland chicken and rice luckily i did not have to wait long but i would warn everyone to not waste more than five minutes to try this place just three stalls down you will find the same thing made by the same chef that used to cook the chicken for twenty years at tian tian anyways i ordered that drumstick   rather than the breast   that was a mistake because the dark meat was not fully cooked it was rubbery which is indicative of undercooked poultry dark meat takes a bit longer to cook i returned the dish to them and asked for the breast meat they did not argue with me and gave me a new plate the breast meat was indeed moist and tender but that is about it there is nothing going for it the rice was whatever i am not sure what bourdain was on when he had this he must have been high drunk or was just being polite i would pass on this stall and the wait,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this is awesome love it kyla pangcoga,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i love tian tian chicken rice i am crazy for chicken rice tian tian is chicken rice is fragrant and flavorful but not oily their chicken is also very tender i always get a half white chicken rice and the innards gizzard and liver and share for  i think i slightly prefer the one in katong but it seems all the tian tian is are about the same consistently good quality for me this is the benchmark for chicken rice of which i am crazy about,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this place is a legend when it comes to chicken rice garlic chili is fantastic must try,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this place is so hyped up on the internet despite locals telling me not to eat here i had to see for myself service attitude was brusque i ordered a plate of chicken rice for   they give you chili sauce in addition to whatever sauce they pour on but no other sauce which may have soured my experience the chicken itself was tender but that and the rice was pretty much flavorless the only good thing is i only waited about  minutes in line,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian is probably the most famous one among big chicken rice names in singapore however my favorite one is wee nam kee personally i like the meat and rice qt wnk which is to me more tasty than ones at tian tian,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i honestly do not understand why this place is rated as highly as it is yes the rice is very fragrant and the chili is pretty good but the chicken is rather disappointing personally i think you get better chicken at boon tong kee wee nam kee or even five star it really boils down to what is important for you i suppose and although the queue was not that bad on a friday afternoon at around pm the food just did not really impress me i am saying nay to tian tian is reputation as best chicken rice in singapore,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,find a friend go to tian tian and here is what you got to do  wait in line for mins order half a chicken  plates of rice gizzard inhale it and wash it down with sugarcane juice have lucid dreams for weeksanyone can tell you bourdain loves it and blah blah blah but tasting is believing now go on i dare you note closed on mondays,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,need to wait on line but it is worthy to do that super cheap the skin of chicken is just like jelly i went there three times in half month,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,google best chicken rice in singapore and you are sure to find this stall in the list located at the heart of maxwell food centre this stall boast large crowds and occupying two stalls spacing i ordered a medium serving which when it came looks plain boring aside from the looks the medium serving gave quite a big portion of chicken as there was much hype about this stall is chicken rice i think i expected too much as when i took a bite nothing was special about it the chicken and rice was not bad but not best chicken rice worthy the chilli was exceptional which gave life to my bland chicken rice expected much more from them,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the line for this place which is the longest line in the whole hawker centre is only half composed of obvious tourists maybe some of the other half are non obvious tourists which perhaps ought to include me it says that locals are still willing to brave the long tourist enhanced wait for this chicken rice despite being knowledgeable of the many alternatives and indeed this chicken rice is worth waiting for there is not a whole lot of superlatives to add except that you can definitely customize your order to include only leg meat which i liked i ordered  legs for my wife and i do not just order chicken rice if you know anything about this dish and need to amortize your wait over more mouthfuls they are also happy to give you as much chilli sauce as you might need the meat is silky and well seasoned on its own but the provided chilli and dark soy sauce makes it superb i am continually astounded by reviewers who do not seem to understand that in hawker food the side sauces are essential additions and not just for show like salt and pepper on western tables combine with a mouthful of savory rice for a spectacular sensation ps there are lots of seats on the outer wings of the hawker centre do not just look for them inside,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,good quality chicken rice so goo that the queue is barely tolerable usually  hungry diners stretching out into the carpark i took some guests there figuring we could get some good chicken rice we had just dropped into the hong kong chicken rice place on smith street with the michelin star and the queue was over  people so i thought with all the constuction at maxwell we stood a fair chance but tian tian had over  people that day the other hainanese chicken rice place had  people so we compromised it is been a few years but if the queue thins out i will re rate this place you cannot blame a hawker stand for having too much business,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,next off my list would be the tian tian hainan chicken it is true the hainan chicken taste so much better in singapore than in state the line was extremely long i thought i will stay here for at least an hour surprisingly i only waited  mins and the food is ready for me,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,my husband and i were in singapore for our honeymoon and stopped by this stall as it is the famous anthony bourdain spot to eat at prior to having tian tian we had ah tai which is two stalls down i can honestly say that ah tai is so much better tian tian was just a hype and the chicken did not even come close to tasting like ah tai if you are in the area you mind as well skip this stall and go to ah tai they wo not disappoint,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,when in singapore this is a must though the line was long this place carried a very tender juicy chicken and rice i have had similar at home but this was just a notch different and a little bit better than savoy and portland famous pop up hut for hainan chicken and rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,really good this place requires a solid  minute wait but it is pretty tasty the chicken is super moist and tender really great i was surprised how plain it was the place is really cool though and it feels very authentic its crazy that is only costs   for chicken rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian is fine but if you are like me and read about it being the very best thing to eat in singapore and then saw all the anthony bourdain signage they have all over the place you are likely to be disappointed it is good but did not change my life which after all the hoopla i thought was a done deal fortunately the line even when it circles around the stall is fast,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,as the standard bearer of singapore is signature national dish tian tian delivers juicy delicious chicken with some of the most fragrant rice to be found anywhere the eternally long queues are testament to the flavourful food but prepare yourselves for a long wait,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian does not live up to the hype i am someone who likes chicken rice and eats it often at various spots on the island its only marginally better than some of its neighbours inside maxwell there is always a line of more than   people its not worth the wait have had consistently better in amoy food court around the corner isle  spotable by a picture of lee kuan yew visiting the stall,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,it is good but not worth the hype especially when the line wraps around the corner it is a bucket list experience but i actually prefer the chicken rice just down the street at lau pa sat,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,indeed there is no doubt tian tian earned top spot for chicken rice the chicken is succulent the best way to figure it out is order the breast portion white meat tends to be dryer yet tian tian manages to make it tender the rice what can we say about the rice the key to good restaurant is the rice the rice is moist while your chicken head back to be grind by your molar your incisors and premolar would nicely bit on those moist rice what a delicious blend people wonder why would i give a  stars instead of a  for a food court that is not in the indoor ac and they charge for   on my visit in nov  it is a  cents to a dollar to pricey,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,yum well until i learned how many calories are in chicken rice this place was awesome the queue was long but worth the wait the rice was so flavorful and the soup perfect i was a little intimidated on how quickly the people were working and taking orders thankfully i had my fiance who spoke the language to order and pay i wish singapore was not  hours away otherwise i would be here more,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,so here is the low down the rice here is fantastic just really tasty the chili sauce is also really nice as it has a kick of lime in it the chicken well it needed help even for a boiled chicken it had little flavor and was kinda slimy and rubbery and fatty at the same time there are better places to have the whole legendary dish but if you are near by with some touristing friends why not,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,you will never fail to find it it is inside the maxwell food center in the middle with the longest queue chicken is so tender and juicy and rice is tasty also the soup is a big surprise the small chicken rice set is never enough for me at least half of a chicken and a bowl of rice is enough once you had it you will never forget remember to eat hot however since it is just inside the maxwell food center it would be rather busy during rush hours sometimes you may have to take a little while to find a seat,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,chicken rice um how good can this be i was really really skeptical to say the least but it is a surprisingly good dish and for  it is great value the chicken is juicy and the rice is really flavourful with hints of ginger i was told the original cook from tian tian left and started his own stall ah tien two doors down so i tried them side by side and they are about the same i did like ah tien is rice a little bit better it was a bit more fragrant but they are both more or less the same ah tien has some different sauces you can try as well,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,pros chicken rice is deliciouscons hot no a c waiting in line,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,hainanese chicken yummy this place serves up a nice flavorfull meal with local ingredients that just make it unique the chicken i lightly seasoned and moist with hints of ginger and sesame seed oil i have been around and this is a pretty good dish for the price its not the best but pretty close to where it needs to be if you are in the area do try it,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,ever since their chief quit the chicken rice is never the same chicken is not as tender as before rice is most time a bit too hard also they have lose their signature fragrance which they use to have for their rice so far only their sauce which they pour over chicken and chili sauce detent the same standard tiantian is now more like a tourist spot than a famous chicken rice stall which i use to know the long queue is still there but no longer the locals but replace by all the tourist it is just living on their past reputation something to note their ex chef open a stall just a few stall away i believe many have mention that other than the chili sauce they win hands down,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,dude what happened to this place i kept hearing amazing things about tian tian from anthony bourdain to family members here but i went yesterday evening and i did not stars i was not blown out of my seat instead it was just a total let down i have seen angels come from bright lights because of amazing chicken rice i had in singapore ok a little dramatic but not by this place i do not care that the service sucked i do not care that it was in a hot hawker center i do not care that there are tons of tourists i do not care about long lines what i always care about is the taste and i have honestly had better what i liked though was the price so i guess if you happen to be in the chinatown neighborhood and you want cheap chicken rice   to be exact it is a pretty decent option but by no means would i say it is the best in singapore,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,hiding from the torrential rains we snuck into maxwell and gravitated to this stall like moths to a flame god knows if chef sao will be able to keep up their signature dish with all the bourdain madness lately with no line greeting us we happily munched on our plates of chicken rice wiping our faces of condiments and bits of chicken so good oh so good well worth the visit,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,after all the hype i most definitely had to give it a go after passing by maxwell on a sunday and realizing the queue was only about  people usually there is up to a  minute wait i decided i would give it a try the chicken rice is alright a bit greasy for my taste and they tend to add some gravy like dressing on it when served which i have to say definitely gives it a nice flavor boost i have to say though that anything upwards of  is a bit steep for chicken rice which yes may have beat gordon ramsey but what does he know about chicken rice while i am glad i gave it a try i will stick to my usual fares for a shorter wait and a lesser of a dent in the wallet,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,saw this on anthony bourdain so we had to add it to the list the queue wrapped around the back of the building i do not know what they do to this chicken and i do not care i just want it to get into my mouth now i have never had such delicious tender juicy chicken in my life if i lived in singapore i would eat this every day,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the line is always pretty long but this is probably the best chicken rice for the price if you are not up for waiting i personally think the other chicken rice stalls in the area serve comparable fare,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,yes you will wait about min or so to order but do not let that deter you this chicken rice really is that good i tried the closest competitor a few booths down which apparently was an ex exmployee of tian tian side by side and there really is a difference tian tian dish is more subtle in taste compared to the other which tastes mostly like garlic anytime i am in singapore this is my first stop and should be yours too chicken rice is simply the most simplest complex looking dish anywhere and is not to be missed,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,make sure you go to the right one all the chicken stalls in this hawker centre have a blue sign with yellow lettering for some reason,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i do not even like  based on past attempts or so i thought before i made an obligatory visit tian tian expecting to be the lone dissenter anthony bourdain is photo plastered on the stall check huge queue before anything resembling lunch hour check serving ware that looks like it is seen minor battle in a long forgotten war check it is good really good especially the chicken stock the combination of the chicken rice is light and still meaty enough to not have me reaching for spice is it the best  i have ever had yes is it overrated probably since it cannot cure cancer and world hunger simultaneously should you still absolutely come here off peak if you are visiting singapore absolutely,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,not as good as it used to be i feel like the rice is not as flavorful anymore but the chicken is still really tender i was never a fan of the sauce though and always ask for it without it,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the reputation this place has is well deserved be prepared to have some of the best chicken rice possible perfectly tender and packed full of flavor the rice is so good it is up there with top notch sushi depending on the time of day there can be quite a wait but it is easily worth it i would recommend washing the meal down with some avocado juice from a nearby vendor,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this place is featured on nearly every travel programme so i felt i had to check it out i was not disappointed the chicken was the best i have ever had anywhere in the world pillow soft tender and perfectly cooked even the fat was tasty the rice was aromatic and the perfect accompaniment i would have preferred if the brown sauce was left off as all this dish needs is the thick soy sauce and ginger chili paste to flavor it and at sin  it is a steal,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,simple but very flavorful chicken rice dish on a typical hot sweaty sticky day july  thank goodness they sell these very large bottles of beer had a great time eating with the locals and even more fun getting tipsy,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i traveled thousands of miles again to eat something that looked kinda interesting on an anthony bourdain program i am not saying it is not good just sayin i gotta stop being such a fanboy every time i feel like a super gritty explorer only to find a shrine to ol tony and a mutated hipster behemoth of a food stall i do not blame the owners either gut those foodies with their selfie sticks or make that us minus the selphie stick aah do not listen to me i guess i am just jaded  stars says it is a ok following the laws of the free market that should go for every chicken rice place in the area tho,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,saw this place on the show no reservations with anthony bourdain so of course we had to try it on our trip to singapore we walked a good   miles from our hotel to get here but well worth the walk such a fun market place full of different foods and drinks and across the street is the out door market place where they sell clothes and other goods china town is one of the best things about singapore and so is tian tian hainanese chicken rice the line is usually a bit long and the lady there who is in charge keeps it moving very organized the rice is perfect and delish and the chicken is very tender and you will also get a bowl of miso soup as well with your order make sure that you get the sauces that go with it a spicy sauce and a thick teriyaki sauce and your spoon and fork the entire meal for both my husband and i was about   american dollars amazing right so glad that we tried it so delicious it is a must go to when visiting singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,ate here several times over the course of a few days had the chicken rice and fortified it with an extra drumstick which was deboned of all the food stalls at the maxwell centre this is the only one that has a line it is also the only one that will run out of food geez i still dream of this chicken,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the quality of the chicken has dropped dramatically compared to the time when the lady boss was still there the rice is still good but chicken meat is dry service is bad as well they now only give the free soup which is a standard for all chicken rices in singapore if you ask,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,waited  minutes in the sweltering singapore heat not sure if my expectations were too high or the long wait just put a damper on things but the chicken rice just was not as fantastic as i had hoped in fact i would have been more satisfied if i would just gone to my usual chicken rice place in marina square a must do each time i visit singapore the chicken was moist but i do not think the flavour was as good as some other places and was not a fan of their chilli sauce the rice was probably the winner this place was on my bucket list so am glad i get to tick the box not likely to return though not for the chicken rice anyway would not mind trying some of the other stalls at the maxwell food centre,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken was sooooooooo tender rice was okay dipping sauce was a killer might be a bit difficult to find a good spot to sit down during lunch time,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,not bad had to try it since mr bourdain recommended maybe i am just not a huge fan of hainanese chicken rice but it was alright i liked the chicken better at the rival stall but the rice is nicer here,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,some might say the line is not worth the wait i have had chicken rice in many places and i would definitely go to this place again good flavor sauce was good it is chicken rice so cannot really say it is something i would crave but some place i would take friends visiting singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,best chicken rice i have ever eat in the anywhere in the world although the chicken looks nothing special but it taste great also rice do have a great taste too,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,do not miss this place it is as good as bordain says we were traveling with someone who goes to singapore frequently when we went through immigration the officer said welcome back adam he insisted we not miss tian tian at the hawker center the chicken and rice were s delicious i cannot even describe it the bok choi was cooked perfectly prices really cheap five people about us  wherever you are in singapore uber or taxi to this place for a meal,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,please remember that this place is located in the maxwell food center near chinatown i tried telling  taxi drivers tian tian chicken rice and only the last  of the  knew what i was talking about this vendor is the only vendor in the food center maybe even all of singapore that occupies two stalls the lines are long during the lunch rush hour so you definitely want to go before or after the rush for  sgd you get a generous portion of rice and chicken meat white meat with some secret brown chicken sauce poured on top of the chicken and rice tasty indeed you will want to compliment it with a freshly sugar cane drink from the stall directly across from it note that this is the only vendor that has a facebook and twitter page i wonder if they have a healthcare plan too,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,literally the best hainanese chicken ive ever had the chicken is so tender and juicy dont forget the orangey sauce its delicious with the chicken and rice the line is long but come early once they sell out thats it they close shop dont be fooled there is another hainanese chicken shop nearby theirs that starts preparing and getting long lines by unsuspecting tourists when this place closes,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,dear anthony bourdain i am glad you no longer have a restaurant so i wo not suffer the disappointment of high expectations generally i hate queuing for food but after reading many fantastic reviews and recommendations i left the bf in queue with a cold beer to pacify him while i went in search of supplemental food the tables were packed fortunately i managed to chope a table by maxwell road a bit of road construction noise but the cool breeze makes eating beatable unlike the hothouse conditions of the rest of the food centre ok so back to the chicken disappointing the chicken was tough potentially overcooked or from frozen and chopped way too thick i am used to silky smooth meat that is full of flavour and where was my chicken skin i know it is not healthy but surely that should be my decision to make this was then covered with a gravy surely that is only required if you need to remoisten the meat or add flavour to the bland chicken anyway onto the rice it had some chicken stock flavour but was way too sticky and heavy in my opinion could have been enhanced with more ginger garlic condiments the chilli was passable but nothing worth writing about apparently you have to specifically ask if you want ginger and sweet soy i say a lot but the reputation certainly builds up the expectation im willing to try again just to be sure but for now my search for the best chicken rice in singapore continues,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,maybe i am just not a chicken rice kind of gal i came to maxwell center to try the chicken rice at tian tian where anthony bourdain raved about the chicken i ate one ligament filled slimy piece and left the rest the rice was fine but i am not a fan of the slug texture chicken that seems raw and feels rubbery it is very cheap sg   if you love this stuff do not worry the line moves very quickly the servers are curt and uncommunicative you are not allowed one of those plastic cafeteria trays unless you are ordering multiple meals unfortunately if this is as good as it gets i am swearing off this singaporean national food,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,chicken is still as succulent and rice still as flavorful as i remember it years ago the line was short on a sunday morning,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i am visiting and went here based on a recommendation that i will not follow again this place had the longest que signifying that this was the favorite after receiving the chicken and rice i had a hard time swallowing a poached slime like chicken with skin that was like flesh i think that the desire was for quantity and not quality here very little flavor poor texture and a waste of time and calories is my take,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,not sure what they did to the chicken or to the rice to get those flavors and aromas but this is absolutely delicious ask for the thick soy sauce on the side my friends mentioned after the fact that they also serve free soup with your meal it never hurts to ask best   sin i have ever spent,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,upon our travels to singapore chicken rice was on my food fanatic husbands agenda yes we stood in the tian tian hainanese chicken rice line it is what i had expected as far as flavor good chicken with flavorful rice my only suggestion is to order the whole chicken half a chicken is not enough it seemed like it was   of a chicken especially if you are a tourist order the whole chicken do not wait in line for a few pieces of chicken get the whole thing,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this place is solid but the line is forever so go off peak in the end rice can only be so good and chicken can only be so good it is about the condiments you mix in i think the food is fine but in my opinion on a par with similar venues in similar food courts i advise against picking this over others i know everyone has their favorite ones and i get that however to this guy i love them all and the distinctions made between them such that one should wait in a long line does not make sense to me just one man is view,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,we ate here twice during our hr stopover in singapore i still daydream about the succulent juicy chicken that is laid atop a bed of perfectly seasoned rice a simple yet utterly delectable dish that i am sure has not been successfully recreated in the states otherwise i would have found it,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this is my favourite chicken rice ever i know the chicken rice wars have a bit of a religious tone to it and you might hate tian tian for various reasons but i do not care i like it seriously the queue is really long it is very popular with tourists and locals alike expect to queue a lot i like it for the fluffy rice and lovely chicken i think i like it best because it has the better pak cham gai among all the other so called famous ones shrug,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,chicken is tasteless rice is dry veggie is bland not worth to try you should go down to the end of maxwell center there is the old man who used to cook for this kiosk he may cook better and his chicken is cheaper,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken rice holds up to the hype bourdain did not steer us wrong on this one all the components hold up it is a cheap reliable meal be prepared for a line though,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,very low key tiny business but serves delicious chicken rice rice plate chicken rice is what they are famous for and highly recommended if you are there go and experience it the food wo not disappoint you and reserve some time because this place will make you want to walk around and look,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this tian tian hainanese chicken rice is very delicious authentic it tastes like my mother is hainanese chicken rice please prepare to queue up for  minutes minimum but it is really worth your calories,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,awesome as always with the succulent chicken meat and fragrant oily rice,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,super great place to consume the local speciality tasty dishes and efficient service really enjoyed the food,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the chicken rice is singapore is national dish but tian tian is singapore is legend,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,long queue for chicken rice though chicken is tender rice is indeed tasty price is good too,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i never saw the tv episode featuring this hawker stall but based on various recommendations i came here for lunch on saturday looking for one of the stalls with the long lines there are two lines one to order and pay and the other one to pick up despite having chicken rice at boon tong kee the night before we ordered one plate of chicken rice to share chicken was good and tender but i preferred the version at boon tong kee i definitely thought the rice was more aromatic here plenty of open seating in the small aisle behind the stall,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,great chicken rice   a must have while in singapore line moves quickly so do not be deterred lots of locals eat here so you know it is good directly across is a fruit juice stall that sells delicious lychee juice for,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,best chicken rice i have had the portion is bigger and it is juicier than usual the rice is also not as oily as usual it is still cheap though which is probably why the line is so long,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,been to joo chiat tian tian air condition chicken is good and soft highly recommended,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the best chicken rice in town i know because i have lived here for many years and chicken rice happens to be my favorite local dish i have exhausted the many options available but at the end of the day it still boils down to this stall after all anthony bourdain cannot be wrong can he i think to achieve the perfect chicken rice dish both the chicken and rice must be excellent and i have had many plates from many places that serves either perfect chicken or perfect rice this stall serves the most fragrant rice which is moist and flavorful and coupled with the chilli sauce is exceptional the chicken is very tasty and very tender definitely a number  stop for tourists and locals if you have not tried it,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,there is a reason why the queue wraps around the entire food court the hainanese chicken here is phenomenal and the rice that is been cooked in the stock chicken oil is just as good simple yet so flavorful this was probably one of the best things i have eaten in singapore,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the rice is freakin incredible wow i was surprised just how good the dish was i added the garlic hot sauce and that really took it up a level just goes to show you how good a simple dish of chicken and rice can be excellent food and glad i visited the maxwell food centre it was a great experience,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,for one thing the main photo of this yelp page needs to be changed as it shows the wrong location for this particular stall anyhow time for the review this is obviously one of the best places in singapore to get chicken rice although i would not call it the best because i have had better but also i am sure that there is a hidden gem that i still have not found the chicken juicy and good portion the quality of the meat is top notch except one time they gave me a piece that was all bone but that was also my fault for not requesting breast meat the chili one of the best i have had but i have had better the rice good rice but i have also had better there is a chicken rice stall in the redhill food centre which i think has better rice and better chili although the quality of the chicken meat is not as nice i also think that ah tai the competitor to tian tian and also run by the ex chef from tian tian is overall a better stall try ah tai before you make your decision on which is the best,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the rice had the best slight favor to enhance the tender chicken the person making our plate took alot of time to make sure it was perfect and i love the little spray bottle of favor that kept it moist and added something to it wish i was close enough to get it again,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i have reviewed a few chicken rice so far but let me reiterate the  main factors that i rate chicken rice on in order of priority the rice the chicken and finally the chilli there has been a big hoo haa about tian tian and since i do not stay near the area or work near the area this is actually my nd visit i visited tian tian hainanese chicken rice at   pm on a weekday and was surprised that there was a queue looks like this stall is certainty famous first of all let is talk about the rice the rice was fragrant and flavourful however not all the grains of the rice were soft some stuck together and were hard the chicken drizzled in a is pecial sauce mixed by tian tian was amazingly tender fleshy and tasty i also tried the chilli sauce and it was delicious together with the chicken it definitely brings the taste up to a whole new level overall tian tian definitely serves up one of the best chicken rice in singapore but if you are not a fan of queuing better think twice about coming here especially during the peak mealtimes,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i had a long stopover at changi so hopped on the mrt and found myself near maxwell road i knew this place was somewhere around there so after walking around for about  minutes i found it in the hawker centre there was not a queue when i was there i was eating at about pm an odd time thanks to my jet lag inducing travel so service was quick this is simply the best chicken rice i have ever tasted juicy tender and a good amount the chili sauce made it oh so better,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,so far the best tasting chicken fried rice in singapore the rice is so fragrant and you can really taste the ginger and all other spices in it although nothing special in the steamed or roasted chicken definitely  of the modern version of hawker with a separate line to take order and another  to get the food with numbered ticket that you would get and hand down to get the order which makes the long line during lunch move pretty fast,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,chicken rice is the unofficial national dish of singapore the best chicken rice i had in singapore was here matter of fact it is the best i have ever had anywhere this hawker stall is also highly regarded as one of best chicken rice stands in the entire city state the chicken is very moist and tender and the rice is definitely something special looks like a bed of plain white rice which many other chicken rice stalls serve but it really is more than meets the eye as it is much more flavorful than you would expect it to be the rice is cooked and prepared differently using chicken stock and the difference is definitely in the taste and it compliments the chicken perfectly came here twice but really wanted to come back even more times during my time in singapore but there was so much other food to try and only a limited amount of room in my stomach any future trips i have to singapore will undoubtedly include a stop here,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,wonderful everything was just fantastic the chicken was super tender and the rice was great,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,the must eat spot at maxwell food court it is crowded for sure but very worth it chicken rice is juicy flavorful and comes in a large portion for such a low price anthony bourdain approved and i can definitely see why,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,for a full review visit urbanjourney com food an although simple tian tian chicken rice delivers a texture and taste that develops wonderfully in your mouth and the smell fills your nose like no other the rice is cooked in such a manner that every single grain tastes of their delicious chicken broth there is usually no question of whether you are eating the drumstick or the breast meat on a chicken but at this stall your taste buds and so called expertise on countless chicken eating experiences will come into question because you truly cannot tell try only the kampong chicken which has made this stall a living legend under the watchful eyes of madam foo kui lian,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i think it can be better because the vibe is hip the color purple the guys on trend,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,still the best chicken rice in singapore in my honest opinion besides they have a wide variety of dishes apart from chicken,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,worth the wait definitely the longest line at the maxwell hawker center and there is a good reason for it the chicken is tender and the rice is very flavorful there are other stalls in the hawker center that sell chicken and rice but this one is the only one with a line,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,of course i went on recommendation from anthony bourdain easy to spot with the anthony bourdain signs i got to the store  min before they opened but there was already a line of people waiting i ordered the hainanese chicken as expected and sat myself at one of the tables i have to say i was not overly impressed with the chicken do not get me wrong it was good but it was not earth shattering as expected i have had better at other hawker centers again everything was well prepared though and the food was good but it just was not amazing maybe i came with too high expectations the price was obviously very affordable less than  i would definitely have this any day over the regular fast food you find in the us but if you are looking for good hainanese chicken there are plenty of other hawker centers that provide better,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,actually even though the queues are long they move fairly fast from my experience the chicken rice is a clear winner and the star of the dish chicken is tender and good too but the rice is heavenly especially with the chilli which really does pack a punch my advice come at the right time so you do not have to wait too long and prepare your order for your turn so you do not incur the wrath of the owner or other customers waiting in line,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,i must preface by saying that i never order chicken out i am not a big fan of chicken b c i usually think it is bland but i do make an exception in the case of hainan chicken rice i think this place had the best hainan chicken rice of all the places i tried in singapore the rice was really flavorful here and the chicken was poached just right they gave more white meat too which i like better,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,it is a good meal to try something very local and acclaimed if you want chicken rice i do not think there is a better place in singapore the meat is served very well cooked and the rice is spiced just right,Positive
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,this may be the most famous hainan chicken rice because bourdain was here but after eating it i was not overwhelmingly impressed moist white meat with a good ginger chili sauce is important along with a chicken flavored rice but it just was not something i was craving afterwards lots to try in all these food centers and yes the crowded ones are typically good,Negative
tian-tian-hainanese-chicken-rice,tian tian is decent as far as chicken rice go but not above average and not worth the hype everyone would have his or her preferences on how they like their chicken rice of the famous chicken rice stalls chains for those who like more strongly flavoured chicken rice there is boon tong kee that is better and for those who like delicately flavoured stuff chin chin at purvis street,Negative
singapore-botanic-gardens,maaaaaaaaaaaaan this place is humid hahaha and this place is ginormousgantic bring some shorts and a tank top and some good sneakers cuz you are gonna walk miles here hahasimply because you get so caught up in looking at this then that then this a great way to see singapores plant life in a non commercialized environment,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,loved it but do not go here in the summer months tends to get very humid and that will absolutely ruin the visit we went during the hottest season in april or it seemed like that the humidity was peak so after a little while of walking it became exhausting which ruined the experience a bit all in all despite that i still had a great time the place is huge probably impossible to see in one go lots of different trails to walk around to get a good view of the different vegetations take your time wander around and get lost in the this beautiful place just make sure to have water and some snacks,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,a unesco world heritage site this place is gigantic with shops and all manner of plants hidden inside,Negative
singapore-botanic-gardens,there is a lot of various flora and fauna to see here not to mention a lot of things have information printed in front of them so that you know what you are looking at and it is importance it was extremely hot the day i visited i ended up walking from one end of the gardens to the other so make sure to stay hydrated bring a fan hat sunbrella and sunscreen also take a map and do not be afraid to ask for directions i originally wanted to visit their orchids exhibit too but at the time it was midday and i did not want to bake in the hot singapore sun though since it was march holiday singapore residents and prs got free admission which is a pretty awesome way to promote the exhibit besides there were a good amount of orchids on display in front of the national orchid sign in front of the exhibit so i do not think i missed out on too much there is also a path before the bonsai trees garden that has a bunch of the miss joaquim flowers growing,Negative
singapore-botanic-gardens,singapore botanic gardens is indeed massive aka huge to explore from one end to the other end i went with ht on a wet friday morning first time when i went to singapore botanic gardens in a downpour its free to enter the park do allow yourself plenty of time if you intend to cover the whole singapore botanic gardens since ht wants to visit the national orchids gardens in which at the time we visited some parts of the exhibits are under construction the highlight of my recent trip to singapore botanic gardens in a downpour was to see a family of otters swimming around in the pond nearby the singapore botanic gardens is accessible by car bus or the nearest mrt station is botanic gardens mrt station cc dt both the circle orange line and downtown blue line do visit their website run by the national parks where free guided tour is available during the month and the schedule allocated for these guided tour it can be found through this website nparks gov sg sbg educat,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,lovely peaceful green open spaces calming meditative lingering knowing that it can be hot just plain and simple the singapore botanic gardens is really a lovely place to wander meander walk explore get lost learn it is like the mini ny central park of singapore although much cleaner greener and more beautiful difficult to see all the themed gardens properly in one visit unless to are good on your feet to wander around for  hours or so but a great place in singapore to visit even if you only have an hour there are some places in the garden that i was in the presence of dozens of people and then there were other areas that i was peacefully all alone void of another single soul short the giant lizard that crossed my path there is no charge to visit although specific areas like the orchid garden will have a nominal fee the botanic gardens are reachable via the mrt there are many places to purchase cold drinks snacks and souvenirs the visitor center is large with gifts and souvenirs in abundance especially with an orchid theme grab a map when you enter the park be sure to have some water to hydrate with you wear good shoes for walking and enjoy this gem of singapore,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,pretty garden where you can take a jog or enjoy a sunday morning or afternoon with the family on sunday is it gets pretty busy since lots of people take out their dogs or go jogging,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,gorgeous spot tinier than i expected many types of gorgeous flowers and shrubbery a sight to see,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,founded in the year of  singapore botanic gardens was inscribed as singapore is first unesco world heritage site on th of july  i am one of the very few here who is giving one of the most popular attractions in singapore a less than a  stars review like fellow yelper matias h i am more of a city person and not a nature person this does feel more like a park a huge park to be exact rather than a garden i do not even remember when was the last time i visited the singapore botanic garden this week i have a friend who was here for a conference and extended the stay for a few days we decided to check out the gardens together it was awesome now the mass rapid transit mrt has built a botanical garden station next to the attraction use the downtown line or circle line to come here admission is free for all except to the orchid garden saying singapore botanic gardens is huge is really an understatement it is massive the grounds are very well maintained we were blessed with good read hot and muggy weather i take that kind of weather any day rather than heavy downpour or thunderstorm when visiting a place like singapore botanic gardens where there are not many shelters admission to orchid garden is sgd it is inexpensive there are many beautiful orchids there there is also a section of vip orchids which are orchids named after foreign dignitaries i saw there is an orchid there which was named after queen elizabeth ii during her visit to the gardens in  there are not enough benches throughout the attraction again i do feel this is really more like a park i guess the weather being too hot and muggy or heavy downpour thunderstorm can ruin the full enjoyment of the botanic gardens this will be a perfect place to relax have a nice stroll do not be ambitious and try to cover all grounds or just want to escape from the hustle bustle of a city provided the weather permits then again for me i chose gardens by the bay over here any time as my peaceful sanctuary in the the bustling city called singapore,Negative
singapore-botanic-gardens,such a beautiful and romantic garden and best of all is that admission is free there are exhibits inside for which you have to pay but there is plenty to see and do for free this garden is beyond large you can spend all day admiring the different flora and fauna you will see beautiful water features sprinkled throughout including water falls and serene lakes a warning it is muggy so you will probably sweat your clothes off,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,favorite place in singapore twenty minutes from cbd and you are in a tropical paradise wildlife orchids trees open lawns great restaurants trails fresh air love coming here to walk around have a picnic read a book,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,a very well maintained garden with a variety of plants and flowers to look at while taking a nice slow stroll the tall trees make cool shades away from the blazing sun good to go with kids and elderly,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,every community needs nature and with this enormous garden especially considering the size of the country singapore nailed it obviously i am not the first one to say so unesco for one beat me to it by a few years as a tourist who is not used to the kind of heat and humidity singapore residents call normal the size of the garden was a bit much to bear all in one day yet all in all i am very glad i paid a visit if you are in doubt between this and gardens by the bay this is totally worth it imho,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,this park is huge and absolutely stunning spend several hours here just walking or bring a picnic i have not done the orchid house yet but look forward to it,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the singapore botanical gardens is worth a visit when in singapore the gardens have numerous trails and sections the entrance is free except if visiting the unesco world heritage site orchid gardens the admission to the orchid gardens is only s  if you only have time to do one thing visit the orchid gardens at a brisk pace it is possible to walk through and see everything in an hour there are numerous photo opportunities in the orchid gardens i have never seen so many different types of orchids in one place the variance in color is phenomenal peaceful and tranquil even with all the other visitors,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,beautiful gardens with excellent cafes and restaurants despite the heat this is a must do in singapore,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,clean and green the singapore botanic gardens is a beautiful park free to locals and guests from around the world if you wish to see the world class orchids in the orchid garden the entrance fee is a small s  there are many amazing sculptures to look out for during your walk i love the one with the marble ball floating on water you can spin the heavy marble ball it is all about the physics the gardens has an outdoor amphitheater where you can take in free concerts put on by the singapore symphony orchestra there is a diversity of plants and wildlife i love watching the various waterbirds that take advantage of the ponds in the gardens there are exotic birds like the hornbills i also love the adorable squirrels with the handsome black stripes the best time to take in the gardens are the mornings and evenings when it is not too hot and the crepuscular wildlife are out,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,wow what can i say this place is absolutely amazing and is arguably my favorite part of singapore the diversity of greenery here is amazing as you can experience different biomes such as the rainforest and high altitude mountain plants all within the same park there are a lot of different exhibits that make you think you are in a different part of the world or even time period this is a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of the city and nothing is nicer than coming here for a brisk walk or light jog to start the day the best part is that aside from one part of the garden the entire thing is free this is an absolute must do in singapore i would recommend tackling the gardens in the early morning or late afternoon while it is still very beautiful in the afternoon singapore is humid weather will make it a very sticky experience,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,quite frankly this is one of the more soothing but delightful botanical gardens that i have ever visited the whole park is wonderful you should definitely go,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,everything about singapore botanic gardens is pristine and beautiful and a wonderful way to spend a day away from the urban intensity of the mega malls the gardens are expansive exceptionally well kept and wonderfully free and the special orchid garden exhibit is only  per person which seems quite reasonable once in the park you can meander around all over the place with only seeing a few other people so again it really is a nice break away from the crowds within the park there is a nice variety of designated areas a jungle y area medicinal plants exhibit etc there are also some surprises like monitor lizards which i thought were pretty awesome compared to southern california is tiny emaciated little lizards the restaurants on site are also worth visiting as we felt all of them seemed to have good seating you are not crammed inside a building but rather have your pick of outdoor seating with pleasant views and shade and an impressive amount of healthy food choices do wear sunscreen as there is a decent amount of shade but you will still see a good bit of sun also the gift shops including the orchid exhibit one have some beautiful pieces of art so keep that in mind for any sort of christmas mother is day whatever type presents,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,i have never been to the eco lake so it was lovely to be able to check it out the weather was perfect the sky was so blue that it was surreal since it was a friday morning i was there i noticed there was quite a crowd one new thing i learned is that you ai not allowed to take out of the garden any leaves even the dried dead ones on the ground the garden warden was there and kindly relayed the information so whatever you pick up remember to drop it back to its natural habitat,Negative
singapore-botanic-gardens,beautiful place to visit lots of open lawns sitting areas places to eat a rainforest walk and gardens of various themes it is also free be sure to bring mosquito repellent,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,this garden is beautiful and definitely worth a visit if you are in singapore there are so many beautiful flowers and areas where you can relax have a picnic and just take in the views,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,totally free orchid gardens cost  but are totally worth it take plenty of time to go through they are huge everywhere you look it you see something different from a huge variety of different flowers to attractions such as swings and even swans i had never seen a swan in real life prior to visiting here and they were beautiful the grounds are very well managed and very clean a great place for a picnic or a leisurely stroll would definitely recommend visiting here when visiting singapore,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the singapore botanic gardens are amazing the park is huge you could spend all day walking the paths if you wanted to but you can also spend as little as an hour looking around and still probably see most of it the orchid garden is definitely a highlight you can roam the gardens for free but you will pay  to enter the orchid gardens bring lots of water and sunscreen it is hot out there,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,this place pretty much blows nyc is central park out of the water there are so many twists turns and pathways that even when there are many visitors you feel like it is there just for you to explore we spent  hours here just taking a relaxing scenic walk with small breaks during that time we saw a handful of exotic animals tons of exotic plants and a wedding photo shoot if you come here at a time other than morning or evening i recommend an umbrella since it can get very hot sunny near the center of the gardens is an outdoor amphitheater which has some of the best spots for a picnic the coolest thing about this place is that it is free to the public while in singapore you really need to add this to your list,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the botanic garden is the start of the orchid garden and i enjoyed it just as much as the orchid garden with tons of gingers bromeliads and even a man made water fall that i enjoyed then you are brought into the gift shop for you to see anything orchid related which then dumps you into the orchid garden my favorite part of the botanic gardens it is gorgeous and a great photo op especially for weddings come here and intend to spend about  hours here though i spent more time here since i was so in love with all of the orchids i loved it so much the second time i came back i got the pressed orchids in a frame to put in my office,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,gosh i have not been back to the botanic gardens since my age became double digits but it has evolved gracefully over the years to remain a lovely singaporean attraction randomly decided to stop by while taking the circle line the mrt exit puts you on the bukit timah entrance which sets you up for a lovely walk through to the main entrance at tanglin obviously lots of beautiful flora and fauna to be found around the park but my nostalgically favorite part of walking through the park was the aromatic smells of pandan leaves and fresh ginger it is almost therapeutic for locals and visitors seeking a short break from the urban jungle the botanic gardens offers the perfect little respite,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,botanical gardens usually are not too impressive but this one actually is there is plenty to see and is a photographer is dream with the endless amount of scenery this place can provide this place is calming and relaxing and even the trail through the waterfalls is great the trail even goes upwards so at times it will almost feel as if you were outdoors with the height that you reach and there is even more great scenic shots that you can take and even more interesting plant life when you get to the top by far the best garden set up i have ever seen and with tons to do,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the main botanic gardens are sprawling and provide a nice respite from the city life if you are looking for something a little more low key than shopping or chinatown they are quite peaceful but nothing extravagant or too terribly interesting with the exception of the orchid gardens they are a separately listed attraction they are lengthy and include various paths you can take depending on your interests one of them was a rain forest path that had sections of raised wooden walkways they also noted many types of trees by name and provided information about them it was pleasant but probably more like a   stars the orchid gardens on the other hand were breathtakingly beautiful for adults kids seemed to lose interest after the first several dozens of plants we bought some sandwiches from a local deli on our way here and it was nice to eat and walk just take care not to litter as you would probably get in trouble and besides only jerks litter,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,thanks to the courteous regent hotel staff was given directions to the botanic garden as an option for a light   mile    km morning run i was not disappointed i jogged along napier road turns into holland rd and ran into this lush park to the main gate road there are plenty of challenging hills and after passing the large spinning water ball i suggest you take the rain forest path which is shaded and beautiful you can stretch you runs to longer distances here at early in the morning there is not too much foot traffic to navigate other than ny is central park this could very well be among my favorite parks to run on if you are visiting do not forget your running shoes you will want to run this every morning highlights  ginger garden neat waterfall you can crawl behind  foiliage garden closer to bontanic gardens mrt  evolution garden my favorite garden of all of them  statue of chopin overloking lilies and stage by symphony lake the healing garden find out which herb helps cure your physical ailment  reflexology bamboo path rain forest great if you need shelter from the heat this is my favorite place in all of singapore,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,such a nice free facility if you are visiting you have to check this place out you cannot miss the orchid gardens singapore is national flower is the vanda miss joaquim orchid and these gardens are absolutely lovely so many places to take photos you do not even need a filter to make them look good they typically cost  adult to go in but if you are a student it is  when we went they had a promotion and the entire orchid garden was free the rest of the park was quite nice as well it is less floral and more trees and plants i would say it takes about   hours to walk through the entire park most people just come here to sit and relax on the many benches and the grass,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,good to go visit the orchids garden there is a fee to enter the highlight of the botanic garden   is the entrance fee nice for photo ops,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the best place in southern singapore there are a huge assortment and array of animals and plants in a single day we photographed a squirrel eating a huge nut two amazing birds small and big lizards dragonflies bees and amazing plants of all shapes sizes types and colour there are also loads of eateries and undercover areas so if you heat up the cool is not far away there are small souvenir shops and ice cream parlours which are a delight in singapore is hot and humid weather great place to go to if you want awesome photos new animals you have not seen before and is an amazing spot to go for a run totally recommend it,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the gardens are very well maintained and the orchard garden is quite interesting just be aware that the environment is not very breezy so it will be a warm trip,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,truly one of the best attractions in singapore the gardens are free but the orchid garden which you can get into for i believe  is truly spectacular there are so many orchids and great spots to just enjoy the beauty of the flower it can get hot so make sure to bring a bottle of water when you are there you will see children playing definitely a bride and groom taking pictures animals incredible trees and more sometimes you will stumble across a concert or some other cool event it is always a little bit of a mystery take a couple hours out of your day spend a some time outside and away from the malls,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,absolutely fantastic place and totally free to explore and enjoy no entrance fee the entire gardent is impeccable and the grounds are so well managed we loved the orchid garden in particular st outdoor orchid garden we have ever visited at any botanic garden any visitor to singapore should make it a point to visit the botanic garden it is a must see do not miss out on the singapore botanic gardens,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,great place with lots of tropical fauna and all kinds of lush flowers the national orchids exhibit was also excellent lots of walking but plenty of photo ops admission charge for national orchids but otherwise free if you want to skip the orchids,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,whenever i feel stress i like to come here and walk i have learnt the short and long walks to get from the botanic garden station to the napier road is entrance its quite enjoyable especially if you know the way around excellent place for jogging and enjoying taking in the greenery which can be a good thing after spending many hours in the office especially there are also restaurants over here if you like to spend some romantic moments with your loved ones very high chance you wo not bump into your colleague or boss over there as you know singapore is small bumping into people that you hope to avoid can be a challenge so why squeeze yourself into crowded places when there are parks like botanic garden around if you come during rainy season remember to bring an umbrella along as there are not that many shelters along the way let is hope the park stays as it is,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the three main lakes you will find here are eco lake swan lake and symphony lake in ascending order of popularity the first lake is closest to the mrt to the north near bukit timah rd you basically have to pass this lake if you are walking from the entrance to the stairs that lead to nus law school and lky school of public policy the parking at the west of the park on cluny rd is   min considered the most expensive parking here swan lake is all the way south facing holland rd as the name suggest you can find swans in this lake and many folks opt to stroll around the lake as there are a few pavilions and a walkway you can find coupon parking on the west of the park after turning right from holland to tyersall ave note that this is a one way road and the only way to come back here is to go all around the whole botanic gardens symphony lake is where the action happens there is a performing stage where musician occasionally come to perform check the schedule on the website before coming lots of people come with their picnic baskets wine and mats on a lazy weekend evening the kids will enjoy the space elderly friendly too,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,great place to stroll and rest in the mornings and evenings several eateries where you can have a meal cool drink after your walk orchid garden is a must visit,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the gardens are a peaceful respite from the busy city life quiet huge well maintained and really easy to walk around not many slopes the gardens are themed making it interesting to walk the routes early in the morning during a weekend you can see expats and locals doing their morning walks and jogs the elderly doing tai chi in an open field swan lake a peaceful lake with a pagoda kids playing football an orchard garden entry at a cost and a tourist shop stocked full of interesting goods and cafe at one end of the ginormous gardens amongst other things best of all it is free except for the orchard garden,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the singapore botanic gardens are breathtakingly gorgeous and free to the public what a great little oasis in the hustle and bustle of the city this is a great spot to explore on a morning jog or walk and you will want to be wearing your gym clothes because of the heat you might even spot a monitor lizard sunning by the lakes tip bring your student id to get discounted admission to the orchid garden s  without the discount once in the orchid garden be sure to visit the mist house and the cool house the best part of my visit was a really sweet little old gardener who came over and pointed out different types of ginger plants to me in the ginger garden he clearly took such pride in his work and was so happy to be able to share his extensive knowledge,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,hands down my favorite place in singapore a great place to retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city lots of great sceneries and experiences ranging from the heritage trees majestically standing tall to the swans and the occasional monitor lizard crossing your path,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,i have been there many times love to bring my family again kyla pangcoga,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,quite a long way from the marina area where my ship was docked i wished i had more time here it is definitely a place to relax walk around and enjoy the scenery a big botanical garden so you will need at least half a day to explore the whole thing,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the botanic gardens are a hidden green gem right in the middle of the little red dot just recently bestowed the unesco world heritage site honors the gardens are extensive and beautiful the main attraction is of course the orchid garden which for a few dollars is a must see when visiting singapore it also has a cool house to bring your temp down after a day walking through the sweltering heat the gardens are one of the few places that there are hills with suitable paths for running so this is also a popular training spot do not be surprised by a gaggle of galloping runners passing you at night the gardens also have a few nice restaurants highlights by blue bali on cluny which is a fun nano brewery with a decent ipa serving indonesian and indian food with a balinese decor,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,i initially was going to skip doing this review and let it join the endless list of others that got sparta would into the bottomless backlog pit that i will never look back into and do anymore especially since it will have nothing to do with food nor has it anything to do with a rant about some business that i had felt compelled into yet something must have changed my mind into thinking that this would be somewhat of a tribute to a gem within my own country that i have been away from most of my life and severely bored of after these last few months i asked for endless recommendations on things to do in singapore and most of the things that came my way brought out the you have got to be joking me look this however ended up being one of few places where i enjoyed my visit to skip the whole boring layout of what is great and what is not about this place i will just highlight two things that really caught and held my attention for a bit first the swan lake yeah a gigantic pond with a pair of swans that drew a bunch of twats who did not heed the warning sign of do not feed the swans because they wanted to either do some goodwill to them the ignorant way or because they wanted a closer photo seriously you know why you do not want to accidentally kill one swan right they only have one partner through their lifespan you kill one the other one dies along i was so tempted to push one of them into the pond and say oops oh yeah besides the swans the pond is filled with gigantic fish especially those  and i spotted a few    feet long catfish kids were feeding them too but there was not a sign this time and all along i just kept thinking to myself how freaking awesome it would be to drop a line in with a light rod trying to pull up one of those monsters that would be freshwater fishing close to its best second the orchid gardenokay for all you american readers the orchid is the national flower of singapore so if you really want to see different varieties of amassed amounts of orchids in one spot without breaking the bank and just sweat this is your to go spot the varieties were stunning the other tourists were fun to jibber jabber with the other people helped take photos and discussed orchids with us like they were botanists the the woah there is one called the princess diane good thing it was pretty anyways not going to rant on the obvious uploading photos as in these situations they are more than words can really express ps coldest spot in the whole botanical gardens is a little a c would room in the middle of the orchid garden trust me i was in there for a long time trying to cool off from the infamous singaporean heat yelp,Negative
singapore-botanic-gardens,ok i will admit i am much more of a city person than a nature person but i was reluctantly dragged along to the singapore botanic gardens and i must admit that i do not understand what all the fuzz is about it is a garden that to me more looks like a park than an actual garden so i will admit it is fairly big to be a garden but it was unimpressive the fact that most of it is free is i guess also an appeal but other than that i gather that the popularity must be due to singapore being a city with perhaps a lack of space and open parks for me as a visitor and being from a country with much more open space this is something that is not at all worth a visit and i have been to much cooler gardens mainly in japan and the uk and nicer parks so if you are not really into gardens give this one a miss,Negative
singapore-botanic-gardens,many people visit this place very widely on the weekend there are a swing a wide lawn the cafe with the playground equipment the child can play together too and is very good,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,it is free to walk in the orchid garden is cheap admission right off the mta and is sprawling with things to see it made for a wonderful walk seeing all the locals sitting around having picnics on the grounds on the grounds theres orchid garden ginger garden foliage garden a small rain forest path many many beautiful palms lots of open space a couple of souvenir shops and a small store to sell snacks and drinks overall worth the very inexpensive mta trip for a good  hour walk not sure when the best time is to go but somewhere along the trip one of the signs read that august might be ideal for blooms it is also quite warm and some shade take sunscreen and water with you just remember no drinking on the train not even water my only gripe not enough benches to sit and enjoy the scenery,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,yesterday i took a  km walk from my apartment to the singapore botanic gardens once i got there i broke into a run slowing down once in a while to soak in the views what an incredible place to run there are gardens lakes undulating paths and greenary of all sorts there are fellow sweaty runners owners walking their adorable dogs and couples taking a romantic stroll hand in hand i did not feel any exertion as i picked up pace all i did was soak in the beautiful sights sounds and smells if you love running you gotta run here,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,an oasis in a modern city and a beautifully thought out plan and execution the orchid garden was well worth the visit and we could not find a single false note in the entire park a wonderful offering in a surprising city and truly calming and restorative,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the singapore botanic gardens is a  acre and   mile long botanical garden it is half the size of the royal botanic gardens in kew or around one fifth the size of central park in new york it is the only botanic garden in the world that opens from  a m to  midnight every single day of the year and does not charge an admission fee except for the national orchid garden one of my work hosts took me here one night after dinner to wander around the place was gorgeous all lit up and my only regret was that the visit was so brief,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,these gardens were large beautiful and meticulously maintained we spent a very fun afternoon exploring the gardens and within two hours were tired and it was hot and rainy but we did not even cover it all in that time there are cafes throughout the garden as well to explore beautiful place in singapore,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the only place in singapore where i do not mind hanging outdoors in hot and humid weather this place is seriously gorgeous with many attractions and are all beautifully maintained i am lucky enough to have lived only a  minutes walk from this place not anymore since i moved away from singapore many moons ago tt hence this became my favorite spot to do some exercise or when i felt like strolling one of their main attractions is their national orchids garden as they have all kind of orchids that you can admire in a tropical setting also this is the only section in the entire garden where you have to pay an admission fee but it is definitely worth your buck they also have a small food center located towards the end of the garden i would often brisk my way there after my exercise and get some traditional singaporean breakfast limited selection of stalls but food was pretty good,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,extensive beautiful immaculately maintained and free lakes waterfalls and special exhibits like the orchid garden make it easy to spend  hours here long pathways and themed areas give this excellent direction lots of information placards in english in the orchid garden you can see various orchid varietals that have been named after famous visitors and heads of state to singapore it should be noted that on one fateful day when i was homeless or rather hotel less in singapore as a backpacker that i was able to spend a good portion of my day here and upon close i was able to sleep in a movie theater on orchard rd which had showings throughout the night at am am etc,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,i am not sure if i can actually add anymore information to this place than the  other reviews that are here including the photos in a way i am not surprised considering these botanic gardens have made its way on to the un heritage list and to be honest with you i am not at all surprised if you love wandering through gardens then you will absolutely love this place my initial intention was to simply wander through a small part of it but i was literally sucked in to spending much much more time here than i originally planned though i ended up doing everything in singapore that i wanted to do sure this is a botanic gardens but there are two things about singapore that stand out food and gardens in fact i would go as far as to say that singapore is a city of gardens which i find absolutely amazing considering it is one of the most densely populated city states in the world and this place is vying against the gardens by the bay as the jewel in the crown and that is only two of the amazing gardens that you will find here as for my favourite part of it that is a really hard question to answer because there are just so many amazing parts to this garden such as the foilage garden the rainforest walk and the heaps cool bonsai display that i simply cannot put my finger on one part if you love gardens all i can say is set yourself an entire day to experience this place,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,oh singapore botanic gardens how do i adore thee in a nutshell this place is huge beautiful and free to visit the vegetation is tremendously lush well maintained and you can also see some interesting wildlife and insects swans turtles butterflies and birds are scattered throughout take your camera and enjoy a aesthetically overwhelming walk jog or picnic do not miss this place if you are visiting singapore and visit their website for more info especially a map so you do not get lost,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the singapore botanic gardens has always been one of my favourite haunts i like the tranquillity down here as a little girl i absolutely loved it when mom and dad brought me down to see the swans at swan lake sadly there are very few left and i have not seen the black ones anymore the squirrels i spot make up for this and parents buy some fish food in the vending machines and let your kids feed the fish in the lake the national orchid garden is worth a visit for a nominal fee come here and find out which orchid species are named after celebrities royalty and politicians you will be taken in with the beautiful floral displays the evolution gardens is where i learnt how trees fossilized and turn to stone it was also a journey back in time to see how plants evolve into what they are now this place is not just for nature lovers drop by if you want a break from urban orchard road to top it all entrance to these green lungs is free,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,when i travel to new locations or old ones too i like to explore  things aquariums zoos and botanic gardens of course i rank singapore is botanic gardens in the top  must see gardens in the world if you are passionate about tropical plants and orchids there is no better place to experience their color and diversity than here being located near the equator the gardens is blessed with the ability to showcase blooming hybrids year round i have had the unique opportunity to work with dr yam tim wing the head orchidologist at the singapore botanic gardens in addition to creating some awesome vandal hybrids they are also working on conservation efforts for endangered orchids we had taken some newly grown grammatophyllum speciosum and reintroduced them to the island of pulau ubin you can easily spend a day walking up and down the paths and exploring what the gardens has to offer if you have a day to explore singapore this must be on your list,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,great ambience especially in the evenings i come here regularly now for evening walks with my family there always seems to be activities going on by the lake which we enjoy other than the construction on the north end we are proud this site has been designated as a unesco heritage site tourists should definitely visit,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,lovely orchids and rain forest walks docent narrated rain forest walk and explain heritage trees walk on own through orchids cool house orchidrium vip orchids,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,such a lovely oasis in the middle of a big and bustling city the air is fresh and cool and it is just a beautiful place it is big and you can spend the entire day there if you have at least  hours to spare stop by,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,i am lucky to have the pinnacle of our fair land is agricultural and horticultural landscaping at my disposal a leisurely  minute stroll from home on sixth avenue though the bukit timah entrance is still rather new and under furnished in my opinion a perfect place to get lost in provided you are well equipped with an adequate amount of drinking water and in comfortable attire shorts and a t shirt a little less not more the swan lake towards the napier road exit is one of singapore is most underrated trademark landmarks and newer exhibitions like the hanging roots a long passageway topped with plants with dangling roots caressing passers by as they walk on by is a testament to the innovation we have in tropical plants still waiting on some of the renovation and the weather gets a little too muggy for comfort sometimes even in comfortable attire but the singapore botanic gardens is a place not to forget,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,this is one of my favorite spots in singapore it is an amazing place to come for a walk or to work off some jet lag there are hours worth of walks amongst beautiful trees and flowers there is also an orchid garden which is amazing which you can get into for a fee i think it is  or something like that and is totally worth it it is beautiful this is one of those places you can come again and again and always discover something new,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the most amazing free public park i have ever been to this place is so well groomed and so full of variety that you could spend a couple days here just walking around and not see everything they have tons of random mini parks inside including an educational park about evolution and a tropical rainforest if you have time its worth going to the orchid garden as well paid,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the singapore botanic garden is relatively a whole new place away from the hustle and bustle of the city it is quite amazing how singapore have managed to produce such tranquil place for anyone and everyone it is quite far from where i live but it was definitely worth the commute because it is quite accessible by either trains and buses i love taking photos so this place was perfect for me the place was designed to accommodate three things people flaura and fauna without the stiff layout everything is just perfect the best part of it it is absolutely free to anyone except for the national orchid garden for me it was exhilirating to see squirrels going about swans just enjoying the lake they share with the fish and turtles and the rain forest walk where i got to experience how it feels like to be in the middle of towering trees and endless vines also not only this is a good place to bring your children your canine friends would have a blast in this place as for tourists this is one of the stops you should definitely make having picnics watching occassional symphony performances or maybe just a place to run or hang out this garden in the city will always be a sanctuary for all,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the botanic gardens was a pleasant surprise by day  of singapore i ran out of things to do and decided to check out this highly rated garden to get here by public transportation you have to take a bus from orchard mrt i followed the instructions from their brochure i found in the city once i got there it was absolutely beautiful you are welcomed by a swan lake that is filled with turtles and fishes inside the lake the gardens are well maintained and it is just a nice place to getaway from the busy streets and city i loved walking around the park and if you are in the shaded areas the temperatures are much more bearable,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,grew up visiting botanic gardens every weekend it was the place for families to take photos spend the afternoon feeding the swans or just a walk in the grounds before dinner at the taman serasi hawker centre just outside the tanglin gates as i grew older it was the place to go on dates watch concerts while having a picnic on the expanse of green field sadly in the past  years singaporeans seem to have traded such healthy family activities for spending their weekends in air conditioned malls instead now the gardens is crowded with foreign domestic workers or expatriates who actually appreciate the value of such a community space just for that i wanted to give it  stars because it is crowded noisy and no singaporeans in sight but having said that the gardens have added many new components that are wonderful like the new entrance and extension at cluny the jacob ballas gardens next to nus bukit timah campus and the botany centre which is home to the herbarium and some of the oldest plant collection in the region the library and bookstore is worth visiting as well afterall the botanic gardens is singapore is first world heritage site and the first rubber tree successfully transplanted out of brazil was at sbg in  leading to the global rubber rush betcha did not know singapore was so important hah,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,strolling though the singapore botanic gardens on a sunday morning was a truly wonderful experience the botanic gardens mrt station is at the northwest corner of the park and we spent about  hours following the various paths eventually making our way to the other side of the garden there are several educational exhibits about plants used as medicines how they cultivate nurse plantlings for planting and also an interesting orchid garden and ginger garden so basically if you love plants and flowers you will love the botanic gardens its a great place to escape from the concrete jungle and people watch there is a good mix of tourists expats and locals all of whom can be found walking running having picnics or just laying out with a blanket and a good book there are usually tons of dogs and kids so if you have been missing your furry friend from home you could probably get away with playing with someones dog for a bit i recommend bringing sunscreen water a hat a waterproof blanket and an umbrella the umbrella is especially important if you are in one of the remote areas of the garden there is not much cover from the rain which comes and goes frequently get a park map when you enter so you do not get lost in the winding pathways i also recommend either bringing food to picnic or having lunch at one of the nice cafes in the garden we opted for food for thought a laid back cafe at the southeast end of the park which gave us a nice stopping point for our walk and also easy access to the many buses stopping at napier road so you do not need to walk all the way back to the mrt our meal cost about  each but you can eat for as little as,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,amazingi went daily on my morning run through the botanic garden it is really nice full of runners and tai chi or similar groups the gardens is extremely green well maintained it is really worth having a walk there and look at all the different gardens the different plants asf,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,such a beautiful place to take a stroll or a run or grab a bite to eat best of all it is right at my backyard the orchid garden is beautiful and the ginger garden swan lake area is among my favorite areas in the gardens,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,in every guide book this is a must visit the gardens are lovely and a pleasant change of scenery if someone does not have enough time then i would recommend gardens by bay over this having said that the orchid garden is lovely and i could have never guessed how many types of orchards there are this seems like a great local spot as well not overrun with too many tourists,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,evolution garden national orchid garden ginger garden healing garden fragrant garden foliage garden eco garden gardens on gardens just like how orchard road is malls on malls this is byfar the most pleasant place i have been to in singapore and luckily i live right across the street and have to walk through the botanic gardens every morning to take the mrt this is a perfect place for people of all ages races species you name it well not all species but the garden is definitely dog friendly i have seen some of the most adorable and fluffy dogs here and i always wonder are not they hot with all that fur in this humidity i guess they have adapted to it in the evenings i like to jog here and just get lost around the many roads and paths i always find something awesome and new today i stumbled upon halia a beautiful restaurant in the middle of what looks like a jungle with a path i will definitely go and give it a try when i am nearby there and not sweaty there is waterfalls beautiful flowers senior citizens doing tai chi expats doing kickboxing fluffy dogs running around a symphony stage a food court and more i would say just come explore here for  or  hours day or night it is opened till midnight well the gardens do not really close at all but all the lights go off after am so it is a bit scary the most peaceful getaway that is not too far and is still accessible by public transportation some restaurants nearby include hatched the wine company mr prata open   mcdonalds gastronomia and la petitie cuisine just to name a few if you get hungry after your exploration around the botanic gardens d,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,a very well kept outdoor garden definitely a must for tourists as long as you can withstand the humidity and make sure you use bug spray also be prepared to walk you will definitely get some steps in do not forget to visit the national orchid park with a small fee it is beautiful inside,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the botanic gardens is well worth a visit a bit of peace and tranquility in the city with lots of beautiful walks in lovely grounds definitely worth spending an afternoon mooching about there,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,love this park one of the best places to wander around and escape the city it is impeccably well kept my favourite is the symphony lake,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,my first time to the famous singapore botanic gardens is only recently when the botanic garden circleline mrt station started operating i walked inside for minute and all i can say is it just felt like a huge garden and nothing more than that then i came to the center of the garden where alot of activities are happening they have restaurants where people are having brunch and a big field in front of a performing stage a very large green field where people are having picnic during special occasions there are performance on the stage while families enjoying picnic on the field the place is good for a slow walk once in a while with your love ones but the sun may sometimes be too hot therefore sunblock lotion is a must have,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,not to be missed according to the locals this was a great distance outside the city but i suppose it is all relative the cab ride was short and cheap from our centrally located hotel the park is free to get into pay the small fee to see the orchids they are amazing,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,came here a few times but till now i am still not able to finish exploring the whole botantic garden there are some small gardens inside showing more different types of flowers there are some food courts and restaurants located at different part of the garden too so when hungry we can search for the nearest food remember to bring a rain poncho and umbrella there are so much beautiful scenery and nature to take photo of do get a brochure at the entrance before you start too if you are coming from the mrt side if not you can get it at any one of the garden there because you will need the map to explore the garden even with the map i still can almost got lost there the gardens are definitely good for relaxing too to my surprised singapore botanic garden are quite near to orchard too next time will be back to explore more,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,this place is amazing and huge it took my friend and i forever to walk through most of the park and again we unfortunately missed out on the orchid garden since we had arrived too late but it was nice to see lots of families and groups of friends gathering for picnics or small games of football there were plenty of signs throughout the park but it still felt a little hairy navigating around as the signs were not always that clear,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,nice get away for a weekend when you live nature to be order huge variety of exotic flowers and interesting theme parks tends to get packed when the wheatear is good so you either choose to bring umbrella and come during sg tropical rain or you live with the folks see everything is possible i about  hours,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,i came here during the day when the boyfriend was working and really enjoyed it it is the only botanic garden in the world that opens from  a m to  midnight every single day of the year and does not charge an admission fee except for the orchid garden which i did not go into i did pay the  dollar fee to climb into the man made trees toward the center of the garden there is a large bridge that connects some of them and it really allows you to take some amazing photos it started to rain so i bailed after a few hours i would like to come back here after dark and see all of the tress lit up it looks amazing from the singapore flyer and the top of the marina bay sands,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,i really enjoyed these gardens i went to relax but the mosquitos prohibited such things so i just frolicked around i always like botancial gardens because you can go there when you are tired from all the travelling and just want to do something where you are not forced to walk around and you can just take in the scenery they have something for everyone and tons of shade the thing that stuck out the most for me was the evolution garden it was so beautiful it takes you back millions of years of how the world is plants looked and how it has changed over time very enjoyable look on the ground there are footprints in the ground oh the gardens aside from the orchard garden award winning is free,Negative
singapore-botanic-gardens,this is one of the to see places recommended by the lonely planet so of course i had to see it it is easy to get to by train and easy to find overall i like the park for it is flora and fauna and that most of the flowers and trees are labeled so we would know what they are there is a map that shows what can be found in each section which we followed now the problem is the signage was confusing we would follow the free map but would somehow end up at a different location than said map the walking trails are easy and paved so it is manageable by people of all physical levels there are also benches for resting now when we went it was in the summer so it was hot and humid it was brutally hot and humid we took many breaks we got to the gift shop which also sold food there was a nice waterfall there for more photo opportunities i would definitely recommend coming here for the variety of flowers and plants found here it is a pleasant way to spend the day and if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,more like a huge park than a typical american botanical garden it is huge with a variety of different attractions including at a nominal fee the spectacular national orchid garden like everywhere in singapore it is hot and humid so bring sunscreen a hat and even an umbrella there is a lot of shade and the gift shops are air conditioned but you will want to carry a bottle of water with you look for the concert stage and check local listings for an evening concert very easy to get to by mrt,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,this is a free facility the gardens are a peaceful respite from the busy and packed city life it is pretty quiet huge impeccably well kept and really easy to stroll around the gardens are themed making it interesting to walk the routes,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,a huge botanical garden that seems to stretch on forever it is very easy to get lost in here so bring a map and tons of water the shrill hum of the locusts just about made my ears bleed but otherwise a very relaxing experience it is easy to get jaded by the sheer size and variety of plants here the highlights are the swan pond and orchid garden the orchid garden is the only part that charges an admission fee,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,it is got flowers and sh t it is hot outside still a pretty place to spend some time,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,really how exciting can an orchid actually be wondered i having been told for the seventeenth time that i must see the botanical gardens when i went to singapore answer pretty bloody exciting such gorgeous intricate flowers that i ended up taking about  pictures of individual plants it is    entry to the orchid garden which is really worth it i found the dry ice garden strange but gloriously s and fell in love over and over again with the flowers elsewhere in the gardens i really liked the statue of chopin at his piano as you follow the path in and the concert hall on the water that looked like a giant lily pad being a redhead i was obviously thrilled with the ginger garden and the sign extolling the beauty of gingers then throught there you have a lovely little artifically made waterfall with a little cave behind it and a huge lake with terrapins fish swans and more gorgeous flowers it is such a lovely place to go and i felt quite uplifted afterwards really beautiful,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,this centrally located green park is about as close to central park as it gets pretty shelters outdoor amphitheater with the occasional concert swans instead of ducks how cool is all of that well it is true that our weather would never be as great as that in autumn or spring in nyc and that we would melt under the sweltering heat or that having a picnic seems pretty ridiculous with all the ants and insects crawling around on the tropical grounds of ours but it is romantic and different and we should never let a little thing like weather stop us from having fun if the weather is really a deterrence head over to the air conditioned restaurants in the park from the very casual like food for thought to the high end halia there is a suitable place for everyone why not head here some time instead of the usual orchard belt,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the botanic gardens in singapore is a beautiful place to spend an afternoon located near the tanglin area and orchard its easily accessible by bus or the orchard road mrt the back of the gardens is also accessible by bukit timah road and the newly opened botanic gardens mrt station the park itself is beautiful with a forest trek area orchid garden swan lake and many other places to explore there are various restaurants inside the garden as well like halia and food for thought,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,next to its newest competitor gardens by the bay the singapore botanic gardens may seem a little bland but it still is an excellent attraction for both locals and foreigners the garden is huge and opens up to various sections like ginger garden or swan lake these segments have specific species of flowers or themes for example swan lake houses several white and black swans whereby visitors can feed them with bread the national orchid garden is the only area that is ticketed over the years the gardens have been through renovations and is now a well kept and beautiful park plants are well maintained with large spaces for families and friends to have a picnic or just enjoy a beautiful day out several sections also have quaint architecture making it the perfect photo spot great for budding photographers or wedding shoots restaurants can also be found in the garden for instance halia in ginger garden serves brunch lunch high tea and dinner the setting is beautiful amongst the flowers and has a perfect atmosphere for a dinner date or afternoon tea with your friends singapore botanic gardens is also in a fairly good location bus stops right in front of its main entrance and the newly opened circle line station botanic gardens make it accessible to most visitors it is also only a few stops away from singapore is famous shopping district orchard road this makes it perfect for tourists visiting the attraction since they can pop over for some shopping my parents even had their wedding photoshoot right here  odd years ago,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,while we do not have something like central park in new york we do have the botanic gardens it is something of a pity as most people dismiss it as a boring place and would rather spend the day shopping in orchard the botanic gardens is just a stone is throw away from the hustle and bustle of orchard road and the perfect place to have a nice cuppa or just walk around also with plenty of space around it is surprising that there are not more people who make use of the space for having picnics and gatherings it is not just about the plants and flowers to see at the botanic gardens after all,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,centrally located just minutes away from orchard road the singapore botanical gardens offers relief to those who are drained out by the hectic lifestyle and busy ness of singapore there are huge lush gardens with trees that judging by their height i presume are hundreds of years old not that i am an expert haha and flowers of all sorts that give immediate comfort to its visitor despite the heat and humidity there are also large sprawling lawns that make the perfect picnic or frisbee playing location there are many different walking trails some quiet and secluded others more popular for the regular joggers you will also see lots of dogs being walked around here so a great place for your dogs to socialise as well the gardens are open from am till midnight daily with free admission so you pretty much can come whenever you feel like it there are lots of cafes spotted around the gardens for you to cool down with a nice cup of iced tea,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,there are no restrooms and drinking foutains eek,Negative
singapore-botanic-gardens,truly a world class park set in one of the busiest and most densely inhabited countries in the world you may want to go early in the morning or evening to avoid the heat and humidity an excellent place to just stroll and enjoy the lakes and scenery if you have a car drive around the park perimeter and see some of the priciest real estate in singapore,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,i have been here many times and i absolutely love their free guided tours of different parts of the gardens always so informative educational and engrossing i have joined the medicinal healing tour orchid tour and the rainforest tour,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the singapore botanical gardens is a huge park with lush vegetation it is the only garden in the world that is open from  a m to  midnight every single day of the year and does not charge an admission fee if you want a place to relax on your way to another top i would suggest it to take a break and relax,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,singapore botanic gardens sbg is one of the most beautiful places in singapore i am always in awe of how graceful the scenery and landscapes are located near somerset sbg is the perfect place for a picnic date or gathering with friends and family i love how it is also really clean and litter free all thanks to the abundance of bins as well as considerate people i often see many children and families here and on occasion teenagers having sweet birthday celebrations a section of the gardens i really like is the swan lake of course it is not often that we get to see these elegant beauties frolicking in the sunshine sbg is also a wonderful place to snap photographs all the flowers here are really unique and colourful accompanied by falling leaves from trees that kinda make me feel like i am in the states cycling jogging and rollerblading here amidst nature would be spectacular as well though i have not tried it yet will probably do so really soon,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,nice escape from the heat i mean it is still hot but there is plenty of shade and some misters in certain places it is definitely somewhere to stop by if you are in town and want a pretty walk also saw the orchard garden which is an extra few dollars to walk through but really cool i loved all the teeny tiny orchards,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,i do not exactly walk around botanic gardens instead i like to find a quiet spot on the open fields and read a book i usually like to hang around the cluny court entrance where it is quiet there are huge overhanging trees in that area making it a great place to lay your mat have a picnic or read a book if you need a coffee or a sandwich for company you could grab some from any of the ground level stores at cluny court,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,there is already a review of the orchid garden which i actually did not see yet but there are so many other highlights in this fantastic botanical garden that to limit its value to orchids is really to do it injustice so far i only did one part of the garden and that was more than enough for an afternoon the rain forest section which deservedly has won prices as the best urban rainforest then the frangipani with their wonderful smell the swan lake under the pouring rain in the mean time and the national orchid garden in all sections did i make discoveries and see trees i had never seen before a must,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the singapore botanic gardens sits just off of orchard and reminds you of the island as it would have been in colonial times a great chunk of it in the middle is given over to raw rain forest the rest of the botanic gardens comprises of several gardens including the ginger garden the orchid garden and the spice herb garden i am a huge fan of botanic gardens and would say this a little on the small side considering the great biodiversity in singapore however it is wonderful if you want to visit all of the distinct gardens in one day budget about  hours the park is free except for the orchid garden but do not let the measly entrance fee scare you it is totally worth it and beautiful all year round i do love the ginger garden because the little education board teaches you that so many of your everyday plants and food are actually gingers like bananas who knew do not miss the library and orchid cloning center where you can watch orchids being cultivated,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,the   hectare garden is open all year with free admissions the national orchid garden is located inside which boasts more than  hybrids of orchids perfect for weekend picnic children can play around in the open space which sometimes offer free entertainment the ginger garden evolution garden and the misthouse offer visitors unique botanical experience,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,lovely park must see the orchid gardens where the riot of colors and variety of orchids astound it is good for a leisurely stroll take time to read the signs that tell a little about the trees and shrubs such a quiet respite from the bustle of the shopping district which is only a  min cab ride away i like it that the park is not overly sculpted or done up which is the case for so many attractions in singapore that are clearly aimed at impressing tourists gardens by the bay being the case in point but has a certain understated old world feel about it i think it is modeled on the kew gardens and still functions as an outdoor research lab for botanists if you are lucky you may get a cab driver like mine who asked if i wanted a ride round the neighborhood to see the homes of the great and the good many ambassadorial residences nearby which proved interesting much of the architecture is colonial villa,Positive
singapore-botanic-gardens,lovely spot in the middle of singapore cbd this is what differentiates singapore and hong kong i have lived in both places and the botantic gardens is just one of many examples that singapore is really a city that respects its natural surroundings at least to its best ability while balancing economic growth and development it is a great place for a walk jog as well as weekend picnics,Positive
singapore-zoo,this zoo was awesome definitely a different feel from what you experience in the usa they have a lot of free range animals which is amazing people are super respectful and they get close are considerate enough not to actually bother the animals the animals seem quite happy here which is always a plus when you go to these type of places you want to make sure that you are supporting the right type of place overall super clean and you definitely get to see a nice wide range of animals a couple of things i thought were highlights right at the entrance when you walk in and as you walk through the park monkeys are free range and just jump from tree to tree there is a beautiful butterfly enclosure where they have lots and lots of space and are definitely living their best life an extremely large walk through aviary with lots of cool birds to seei did it in under three hours but i am sure you could take a little extra time if you like this location is kind of in the middle of nowhere but not too far from the main part of singapore it takes roughly  minutes to get here from the city from my experience night safari and river safari are cool to do but not necessary if you have to choose one out of the three if i had to put them in order it would be singapore zoo night safari then river safari,Positive
singapore-zoo,i came here to see the night safari since it was recommended to me i highly recommend getting a ticket on klook because the prices at the zoo are way higher i personally am not a fan of zoos and going to see animals so i honestly did not find this experience interesting since it is at nighttime it is hard to see many of the nocturnal animals this was also a family attraction and that means i had to be around a lot of crying babies and kids personally this attraction was not for me i did like rainforest lumina though they have a lot of colorful lights set up around the zoo that you can walk through great for some photography opportunities i do not see myself coming back here unfortunately but only because zoos are not really my thing it seems,Negative
singapore-zoo,im not really a zoo person so for me to say this place is amazing is amazing in itself i cant say enough about the staff working at the zoo professional courteous and helpful the exhibits are world class our highlight was the pandas who does not love a cool panda right one of the best attractions in singapore,Positive
singapore-zoo,monkey see monkey dothe least expensive way to get to singapore zoo is by taking the mrt ns red line north to ang mo kio and then walk thru the mall to the bus depot look for the door for  bus and get into queue if you forget how and where the mrt station attendant will have printed directions the scenic winding  air conditioned bus ride is approximately  minutes in duration from mrt orchard station to the singapore zoo entrance it will take approximately one hour recommend getting there early when it first opens at   a m animals are most active and awake while waiting for their meals once they are fed it is siesta time and no primate sign language will awake them we brought along umbrellas and water without them i am not sure we would had endured three hours walking in the extreme tropical heat you may bring your meals and liquids but that means you have to lug it around there are plenty of onsite restaurants to satisfy the pickiest of eaters during our visit the polar bear died and primate exhibits were both closed plan your walkthrough accordingly by coordinating show times of animal shows made the mistake ourselves and missed all the shows except for the begging elephants it is a family affair visiting a zoo expect lots of kids strollers and non english speaking visitors as expected no ticket price discounts for nonresidents weekends and holidays are always busier note  of my beautiful animal photos were censored without notice sorry,Positive
singapore-zoo,this zoo is amazing because many of the herbivores and omnivores are allowed to wander throughout the zoo for example upon entrance we were greeted by monkeys and birds walking around the park people are fairly respectful of the animals which i thought made the experience better you can tell that the animals are well cared for and most of them are in quality habitats there are so many animals here and the park is big enough that you could easily spend an entire day or more it also rained at the park so thankfully we had umbrellas and rain gear there is not a lot of covered areas around the park although trees and plants offer some coverage the night zoo is across the way and it offers a completely different experience where you can ride an open one level air bus or choose to walk on dark paths with guides helping you cross walkways some of the carnivores are so lively and close by that you can truly experience the lack of protection being a human offers it is extremely dark on the paths and there is some hills so i would not recommend it for those who have trouble walking as you can stumble easily i had about an hour so i ran through most of it after the bus tour that navigates you through the areas and allows you to peek in and see the animals often herbivores may come right up to you or even cross the street,Positive
singapore-zoo,what an amazing zoo gorgeous natural enclosures and free roaming animals starting from one of the bathroom areas near the entrance a covered pathway leading to the restrooms was contructed with bat friendly tiles so that they can sleep there we saw a few snoozing upside down one was a mama with a baby clinging to her signs said that the bats sleep there then fly at dusk the bathrooms themselves are lovely with foliage open air pond you feel like you are in the outdoors another spectacular exhibit was the elaborate orangutan area a huge enclosure that spans even more area with a multi pathway of vines resting feeding platforms high above the human path we saw an adult orangutan a baby acrobatically weave their way over from the group on these vines adorable the tram that you can choose to add on to the park entrance ticket  at ticketing or  at the tram is a nice way to get to a specific area but the pathways are paved easily walkable we even saw several groups with wheelchairs easily accessing the exhibits and many areas had foliage coverage from the sun which was helpful in the heat one of my all time fave animals is the flying fox big furry friit eating fox faced bats so cute i have never seen them in person adorable to see them sleeping upside down with fruit set out for them for when they wake up we were lucky to see the komodo dragon feeding time they hung a huge chunk of beef on a rope let the  y o adult out he went right over chomped on it ripping it off the rope seallowing it whole i would highly recommend going to the river safari too at ticketing you can get a deal on  parks which we did the river safari is where the giant pandas my personal fave the capybaras are so just going there for them was worth it to me loved this zoo i would totally come back again,Positive
singapore-zoo,world is best zoo hands down no question the animals here seem happy and well cared for they get to roam either freely or large habitats even the pelicans have an enclosure that size of something you would see at seaworld for a much larger creature there are multiple feeding stations throughout where you have the chance to feed the giraffe rhino elephant galapagos turtles and others for  there are multiple feedings scheduled by the keepers as well to really get a close and personal look at these fine animals these feedings are scheduled throughout the day and are free there are also adventure tours where you can swim with otters feed manatees sit with the orangutan and have breakfast and many many more while more expensive obviously these are still amazing opportunities it should be noted that this is singapore be prepared for heat intense sun quick rising afternoon showers mosquitoes etc there is a nice tram that takes you throughout the park when you need to rest your feet but it is an additional cost to your ticket of  child to  adult i have an annual pass which includes all tram rides and some other benefits such as unlimited entry to all  parks unlimited tram boat rides and discounted food bev adventures and gift shop purchases it is a bit more than a   park hopper but this helps the park thrive and frankly i have come back again and again,Positive
singapore-zoo,what a truly amazing place for anyone and everyone to come to we spent an entire day from am until pm here and needed more time to see and enjoy everything this place has to offer we started the day off by having breakfast with the orangutans what a cool experience we got to walk up to them and take pictures with them right behind us as they ate their breakfast you can see how fun these animals are and what personalities they all have there was a mom with her young baby we got to see up close it was very cool the entire park was full of amazing exhibits and animals make sure you hand feed some of them it costs spd but worth every penny we hand fed rhinoceroses and giraffes what an amazing experience this zoo is quite possibly the best zoo in the entire world and is a must do if you are in singapore no trip here is complete without it,Positive
singapore-zoo,i came here to see ah meng the baby orangutan and granddaughter of the original ah meng the orangutans are great ambassadors to the singapore zoo which itself is world class and well maintained on all levels this is a fun touristy thing to do that should take up almost a whole day i would recommend doing breakfast with the orangutans because you get to see them up close and take pictures within arm is length of them and ah meng too to do the breakfast you have to reserve your spot through the website maximum  months in advance you will get an email confirmation you pay for general admission and then when you are inside you pay again to get into the ah meng restaurant it is a bit of a stretch but how often do you get a chance to see orangutans up close also the orangutans are free range so when you walk outside they will be up in the canopy there is a lot of cool things about this zoo the baboons flying foxes and sloth are cool the zoo itself is huge it is a big walking loop with some cuts in between so if you check the map and see that you missed out on something you can ride the trolley to the nearest stop and yes you have to pay for that and btw the buffet food is just okay there is your typical western breakfast on side and asian stuff nasi lemak congee bee hoon on the other not much to comment on within that regard the food court separate from the buffet itself does have a few interesting options though i got the malay soto and thought it was good oh and hopefully it does not rain on your visit,Positive
singapore-zoo,i am one of those people who can see both sides of zoos and i do not really know which side to follow sure zoos are necessary for animal education to inspire humans to care more about animals and the wildlife but are caged animals really the best way to do this so i think i tend to avoid zoos but i read up about the singapore orangutan program and was really excited to see them since my grandmother was solely responsible for sparking the orangutan protection programs in brunei in the  s we booked the breakfast with the orangutan experience through viator this was a bit of a letdown we seemed to arrive right at the tail end of the experience and had to eat our food in  seconds to then queue up to get close to the orangutans for  seconds anyways at least this rushed experience allowed us some time to walk around the zoo we took the tram first to figure out where we wanted to see more of first impression this zoo has no cages ok not fully true but  true they mostly use a moat system so the animals who do not want to get wet do not run away without the feeling of being quite so caged it was quite refreshing the animals here covered the span of africa asia without feeling repetitive take your time and explore there is lots of little side paths that you might not notice that take you to even more,Negative
singapore-zoo,one of the top zoo is in the world because of the interaction with the animals displays cleanliness and beautiful landscaping the animals are healthy and well cared for and several displays have animals that you can interact with with staff close by to protect the animals the aviary bird house has mousedeer and coutimundi is that will stay quite close to the walking path yet staff that will step in and correct people that try to pet them or get off the path for a selfie great policy of allowing the interaction but only so far use the mandan khatab shuttle and it is only  sd when you do not have a pass will definately return when in singapore,Positive
singapore-zoo,this zoo is huge with a total area of  acres and how big do you think is that a baseball field is about  acres that means this zoo has a total area of  baseball fields again as in other theme parks in singapore be prepared for a lot of walking this zoo is a lot different from any other zoos the animals are enclosure free a moat is the only thing that separates the animals from the public the animals can walk freely in a lush of forest like greenery other animals are just roaming freely and interacting with the public there are about  animals in this zoo they are grouped according to their species the zoo is also well organized there are maps and signs available but it is not really needed because the zoo layout is easy to navigate surprisingly unlike any other zoos singapore does not stink at all it is very clean and no unwanted smell of animal poop or pee how they are able to do this is pretty amazing as big as it is the entire zoo has wifi connection impressive is not it would you believe there also showers available in the toilets wash basins can be found all over the zoo they even have filtered water machines for free in case you want to fill up your empty water bottles how about if you feel hungry while inside the zoo do not worry there is several of restaurants inside the zoo and by the entrance as well i thought a trip to the zoo will bore the hell out of me but to my surprise it turned out to be a memorable experience i therefore conclude that a visit to the zoo is a must when visiting singapore,Positive
singapore-zoo,i have been to zoos all over the world and this is hands down the best i have ever visited the habitats are amazing and thoughtfully created with the best interest of the animal in mind there were tons of activities and moving around was easy with the tram system this is a must see in singapore,Positive
singapore-zoo,tip buy the tram ride adults  children  they do check tickets at almost every station when you are getting on i can appreciate those who wish to walk but there is so much to see that requires tight timing like the shows feedings and zookeeper chitchats that riding the tram can really help you get what you want to see in my daughter and i went on a rainy day fortunately we have been there several times before so it was not so disappointing when the animals were understandably seeking shelter the most obvious was the rhino feeding at   pm the rhinos were so disgusted with the rain that they refused to come out from their shelter even for food and treats we were delighted that in the month of june there were many baby animals rhinos monkeys giraffes they were all very cute the free ranging animal concept is fantastic with the rain many were huddled under leaves rocks or shelters as we walked through the fragile forrest exhibit we were sad that the sloths were hiding the giant fruit bats obviously did not care about the downpour we had fun observing them eating heartily using their hooks appendages to move along the branches the lemur family hid under the platform and the mouse deer found shelter under large leaves on the forrest floor catch the splash safari show the sea lion is adorable tip the seats marked blue is the splash zone get ready to get wet we also enjoyed the rainforest fights back and the primate feeding even in the rain the singapore zoo is a fabulous place to visit tip we were glad we got the  park hopper tickets online it saved us money and included the tram rides  adult tip if you are taking the public bus if you do not have a tap transfer card make sure you have exact change many tourists do not realise that the bus drivers do not provide change and the tourists become outraged that the system is not customer oriented,Negative
singapore-zoo,i have been to many zoos in my life throughout the u s and have been impressed at maybe just a few the singapore zoo blew it out of the park it was amazing we started our tour by having breakfast with the orangutans i would say skip this part and just eat breakfast beforehand the food was more enjoyable at the buffet at our hotel at the breakfast you can get your pictures taken with the orangutan with your own cameras if you do this try to get in line first if you decide to make the mistake and book the breakfast honestly it was not that impressive to me since it is not like you can touch the animals if you want to photoshop a pic with an orangutan you can save a lot of money for this attraction and avoid it all together the overall zoo was awesome because you can get quite close to the animals i enjoyed watching the elephant show the most probably because i am a huge elephant and have a tattoo to provide it haha anyway we did not arrive in good time before the show but would recommend getting to the show about   mins early so you can get a good seat and also have a chance to feed the elephants bananas how cool is that well i have feed bananas to elephants in thailand and i can say it is awesome there are plenty of toilets located throughout the park and a few refill water stations for your hydration needs you will need to drink plenty of water because well it is hot and sticky in singapore duh you have the option to take the tram or walk while inside the park honestly we walked everywhere and there were places throughout that have ac so you can duck in and cool off also be sure to bring plenty of spf and a hat or umbrella to help combat those sun rays that can age your skin,Positive
singapore-zoo,all i can say is that when singapore does something it does something right and the zoo is certainly one of those places that they have done right well there is more than just one zoo here in singapore though but this is the main zoo it is huge though you can get around in about three hours and that is if you do not hang around for the numerous shows there are trams that take you around the place but it is small enough that you can easily walk all the paths like a lot of zoos the zoo is divided into sections which focuses either on a different animal type or a region there are even some animals positioned where you can get much closer than normal oh and for some reason there is a polar bear here as well which has made me scratch my head since i did not think they could handle a place like singapore,Positive
singapore-zoo,do it it is an easy walk and a lot to see totally worth it do the pickup by bus and breakfast with the orangutans the buffet is okay and has something for everyone you get to stand in front of the orangutans and have a picture taken,Positive
singapore-zoo,can you believe that i am an adult and have never been to the zoo well that changed when i got the chance to visit singapore i did a tour through viator which included transportation to and from my hotel annnnnnnnnnnd drumroll breakfast with orangutans ok maybe my excitement was a bit much but again this was my first time at a zoo this was only a  hour tour so it was impossible to squeeze in the entire park we started off with the breakfast and the orangutans came down and just hung out and ate with us not directly next to us though close to the end of breakfast we got to snag a picture with them and as you can see in mine she did not look to thrilled with me hahaha afterwards my friends and i tried to map out what other animals we could see but only had time to see a polar bear and the elephants we also took a tram around the park and saw that all the animals not in cages just roaming freely to an extent come on now they are still wild animals next time i am in the country i will be sure to spend more time here and be one with the animals,Negative
singapore-zoo,i have always loved singapore zoo it helps because i love animals too it is one of the best zoos i been in my life it is always great to come back and seen all the animals it is nice to see that they are being treated well and are in good hands i have done all of them river safari as well as night safari my favorite would be the zoo and river safari for different reasons i had the chance to have breakfast with orang utan as well taking pictures twice with my husband with them as the background one when we first started dating and the recent one after  years of marriage over the years singapore zoo have grown and i grown up with them they have expanded through my hazy memories i believed at some point i have taken pictures or met ah meng as well as inuka though i have moved i have never forget to make my way back to singapore zoo each time i am in town it always a great feeling to know they are still the same clean lovely rainforest like environment with the aim to protect and educate us people about animals as well as its surrounding oh yeah the water in a carton box has totally shown how proactive they are in conserving our environment it was a first for me to drink water in a carton and i totally support their effort you go singapore zoo,Positive
singapore-zoo,another awesome place animals can be seen within close proximity lots to see and do with  parks restaurants onsite recommend,Positive
singapore-zoo,when you are planning your trip to singapore and ask folks what to do or see when you were there you will almost universally hear that this zoo is a very special experience it is the exhibits feel less like that cold sterile experience you remember about zoos when you were a kid that maybe turned you off to them these are amazing habitats where the animals feel well cared for and conservation is the top priority there are opportunities to engage animals very directly in free form enclosures where limurs stand inches from you or opportunities to hand feed animals as well need to cool off the water feature there is amazing i swear our young kids could have stayed there all day we loved watching them running and laughing as giant buckets of water got dumped on their heads almost as much as we loved seeing the animals pay for the tram rides you wo not want to do everything in order because of the timing of shows and feedings or you may just need to find an indoor hideaway during a giant rainstorm the reptile room is the best respite for a passing squall getting the tram rides which are frequent although there are not many station means you will preserve your energy for what is really important the food looks more appealing than it ended up being if you have iffy kids know that no outside foods are really encouraged but sneak that granola bar in if your kids are picky it is a schlep to get there take a taxi  minutes there from marina bay  minutes back if you have the absolute insane taxi driver we had you might almost die  times en route but you will get home in a jiffy in sum we loved the singapore zoo despite the first hour getting absolutely hammered by rain thank heavens for the cheap biodegradable ponchos you can buy in the gift shop,Positive
singapore-zoo,this place is awesome it is the first nocturnal zoo and we took the night safari it was about  min drive but so worth it we saw elephants lions and tapirs so many more some of the animals come pretty close to the tram the audio guide was nice and informative the creatures of the night show was also pretty good the host was energetic and spoke so many different languages they offer to take pics with you at the shows end which was very classy gift shops were reasonably priced only knock is it is at least  mins drive from the city if you try to go to the pm slot give yourself an hour due to singapore traffic overall very memorable experience,Positive
singapore-zoo,cost s  adult ticket roughly  usd can i give a place more than five stars may i please singapore zoo easily deserves ten million stars since this zoo is the best one i have had the chance to visit there is a reason this zoo consistently ranks among the top three zoos in all of the world to appropriately explore the zoo you probably need two days to see everything and learn about the animals appropriately nestled in actual tropical like paradise you can see lush greens trees and even their own private reservoir it truly feels like nature or a jungle there the zoo is so clean and the attractions are very clearly marked they have all kinds of primates reptiles lions birds elephants giraffes and so much more literally name any animal you can think of and there is a  chance you will find it at this zoo world famous american creation finger lickin good kfc is also on site if you are craving some american food i do suggest the local restaurant in two spots of the zoo they offer a breakfast and lunch buffet i believe too bad we missed both and had to eat kfc if you are going to this zoo i highly recommend the river safari and night safari zoos as well highly highly recommended,Positive
singapore-zoo,singapore zoo is a must visit place you should not leave singapore before visiting the zoo night safari is amazing experience and the show they have is cool and educational for kids the audio information you receive for the guided tour is informative and has enough details to teach you something about the life of animals they are also doing a good job by reminding people about the damage of buying material made from body parts of animal in the danger of extinction to the nature and well being of those animal it is usually very crowded hot humid and there are many bugs around be prepared use spray bring water,Positive
singapore-zoo,i do not like zoos they make me sad frankly but not here this one was beautiful and less confinement for the residents i would say only the singapore zoo and the australia zoo would have me return night safari was excellent and breakfast with orangutans was memorable,Negative
singapore-zoo,it is the best zoo in the world the animals are cute and so much more could be pricey though but worth it i wish i could see polar bears but they used to have them but died come lots of fun except it is so hot there,Positive
singapore-zoo,took the subway and then a local bus to get here it was very easy if you have a subway pass the pass covers the subway and bus take the subway to stop ns and then bus  to the zoo the last stop is the zoo real easy to get to there is also a cap stop at the zoo and i did notice some cabs in the area drink plenty of water some exhibits are closed for some maintenance it did not take away from the visit there is plenty of walking some of the exhibits seem far but are not the heat makes the distances feel long but there are plenty of spots along the way to pick up drinks there is a tram system but did not use it the children is zoo in the back has a little water park to cool off in the zoo does not offer anything more than other zoo is i have been to but the educational signs are better than a lot of zoos i have been to if you have kids the zoo is worth half a day or at least several hours to get away from the busy tourist districts,Negative
singapore-zoo,my first thought was why should i visit a zoo when i am abroad singapore zoo is a must visit it sometimes feels you are out in the wild and the animals are just around you compared to other zoos i feel that the well being of the animals is their main concern sometimes you do not see the animals because they have space to hide and it gives you an idea on their natural habitat i will be back next time i do the night safari,Positive
singapore-zoo,what a gorgeous zoo i have never been to the san diego zoo but this was the most beautifully landscaped zoo i have ever seen in true singapore form i did not see any trash on the ground or the general human grime created by crowds the bathroom were the most incredibly designed public toilets i have seen since there was greenery and a pond where the mirrors and wall behind the sinks would go the designers did a great job of making the animal closures as unobtrusive as possible so it felt as though you were in a jungle and they could just walk on over to you they could not of course the animals seemed very well taken care of and i only felt a pang of sadness for the polar bear in the hot muggy weather of singapore we watched the white tigers get fed and it was an incredible show absolutely worth making the time for there was also a giant tortoise feeding demonstration which was cool as well but unsurprisingly a little less spectacular than the tigers you absolutely must see the no cage orangutan exhibit you get to walk in to their open enclosure and watch the pair of orangutans climb through the trees above you i attended a business presentation in one of the zoo is rooms reserved for corporate visits and such the tables seating projector sound system worked great and the catering was impressive i would book a corporate event here in a heartbeat,Positive
singapore-zoo,i am someone who gets easily bored i was not bored here the orangutans are free to roam and they were swinging right above us the grounds were landscaped beautifully we got to watch the orangutans be fed which was super cool if you are in singapore this is a must see,Positive
singapore-zoo,wow this is one of my favorite zoos we walked around with majority of the animals not in cages the panda was the icing on the cake i recommend paying for breakfast with the orangutans the food was delicious and the experience wonderful for the kids,Positive
singapore-zoo,the best part about the singapore zoo is just how un zoo like it feels free roaming monkeys cageless biodomes with all manner of wildlife that you can see up close without any glass to separate you the animals that are behind glass all have typically far more space than i do at home so i am tempted to debate who the true prisoner is they get regularly fed and do not have to pay rent or wear pants i am jealous i will admit it i spent  hours on my first trip and never got bored i recommend planning to see some feeding times especially snack time for the baboons you can pay  dollars for a plate of banana slices and watch  human like creatures stare hungrily into your soul as you assume the role of a fickle food god deciding who is worthy of your favour,Positive
singapore-zoo,the loveliest zoo i have ever been to lush green and most environments are open spaces most all animals were easy to see and get close to felt less like an animal prison than most zoos with luscious backgrounds wherever you walk,Positive
singapore-zoo,i am not quite sure why this zoo is so praised it was a very conflicting experience seeing the enormous african animals with nowhere to graze and there were  asian elephants in a small corner of the park all rocking back and forth looking sad the elephant exhibit was definitely too small for them they typically walk and eat all day these elephants should go to the mandalao conservation center in laos they would be so much better off one of the more troubling things about this zoo was that it is sponsered by kfc as is ustainable and conservationist as this zoo makes itself out to be i found the kfcs very offputting animal agriculture is contributing  of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and is the single biggest cause of climate change that being said there was only  vegetarian option on the zoo restaurant menu  options on weekends and zero vegan options which really bothered me if people come to admire the animals maybe would you think there are people there who object to eating them if there are any mods or admins from the zoo reading this please reach out to your dietary people at the zoo and change this the vegan movement is not just about food and animal welfare its also about the environment,Negative
singapore-zoo,the zoo had a polar bear in a tropical climate that recently died a tragedy he had to live in a prison his whole life,Negative
singapore-zoo,oh my goodness this zoo blew me away if you are a big animal lover this is a must see i have been to a ton of zoos and i am usually disappointed by the small enclosures when i walked into this place while my fiance was looking at the map trying to plan the best route i was wandering in hoping he would start following me all of a sudden i realized that there were monkeys in the trees in planters  feet into the zoo and in no enclosure of any kind in fact a few trees down was a different kind of monkey also allowed to freely roam several of the first group climbed over to hang out with this other monkey i took many many pictures just astounded that a zoo could operate this way we continued to be shocked as we went along we happened to arrive just past midday which we initially thought would be too late but it ended up being perfect timing the zoo has scheduled feeding times and if you planned your route just right you could follow them from one place to another the animals including the ones with free rein like the ring tailed lemurs would just arrive and interact with the zookeepers while the zookeepers told visitors all about those animals it was amazing we even got to take a picture with the orangutans who were perched just behind us like inches my advice is to go during the week take sunscreen a hat and bug spray remember to drink lots of water and if you have a lot of energy buy a ticket for this zoo the river safari and the night zoo at the same time follow the feedings around the zoo watch a show or two and take lots of photos oh and keep your eyes open i spotted a wild flying lemur in the trees as we wandered it was so cool,Negative
singapore-zoo,the singapore zoo is a lovely lovely whole day attraction that i managed to return to just a couple weeks ago i have old memories of school trips here but it is just as overwhelming and just as amazing as an adult and it makes for fantastic photos too there is good eating to be had at the zoo too and not too expensive if you are prepared for it we had good nasi lemak fragrant rice cooked with coconut milk with a slightly dry chicken though plenty tasty and very good sweet chilli really the point of the dish and a good thick rendition of laksa redolent with more coconut milk and tender noodles surprisingly good food and a even more surprisingly fantastic visit in all a definite must visit it gets very hot so bring a hat,Positive
singapore-zoo,spent a recent sunday at the singapore zoo while i expected it to be nice i was not expecting it to be awesome it was an excellent way to spend the day i was amazed at how close you can get to some of the animals it was incredible i would highly recommend the zoo to anyone who is visiting singapore an extreme bonus was getting to see the panda double bonus was the room where the panda is located is air conditioned head to the zoo on your next trip to singapore,Positive
singapore-zoo,great place to go with family lots of other places to visit like panda river safari etc,Positive
singapore-zoo,i have been to many zoos and this is definitely at the top of the list the loop style layout is well planned and keeps you from getting lost amid the huge wide open habitats that many of the animals have and everywhere you walk there is beautiful vegetation and birds flying around it was raining when i went but they have cheap ponchos for sale in the gift shop i could definitely spend a lot of time here and not get bored compared to the zoos in the us you can get a lot closer to the animals here the elephants were splashing in the water just feet from me and actually sprayed water up onto me if you are an animal lover or want to take some cool photographs this is an awesome place to be if i was a zoo animal this is the zoo i would want to live at,Positive
singapore-zoo,wow the singapore zoo is probably the coolest zoo i have ever been to anywhere on the planet and i have been to a lot of zoos while i have certainly been to a few zoos that have small walk in cages where you are right next to the animals i cannot think of any that have such huge walk in enclosures with so many animals just roaming around while i definitely would not recommend actually doing these things for safety and animal welfare reasons the walk in exhibits will get close enough to pet a lemur cuddle a fruit bat kiss a sloth and high five a monkey the animals are all super active and just run fly around the walkways brushing up against guests and posing for some great photos even the exhibits that are not walk in you did not really think they would let you in the same cage as the leopard or the polar bear do you are large with great viewing windows i could spend hours and hours at this zoo and i have and you will want to too the only real downside is there is not a lot of air conditioned areas so be ready to sweat other than that it is an enjoyable place to spend an entire day get to it,Positive
singapore-zoo,we did a quick walk through the river experience at singapore zoo on a wet afternoon the attraction is well laid out given it was a torrential downpour outside there was adequate cover so we did not get wet or need umbrellas you walk through a series of major rivers and the wildlife in each of them with information on conditions environmental threats etc while i enjoyed all of the river experience some highlights were the pandas feeding time the polar bear who was doing a bit of exercise in his her pool and the manatee pool overall would really recommend the river walk and i am going back to look at the main zoo next,Negative
singapore-zoo,the zoo was awe ite they definitely provide a lot of interesting info on the animals but the animals still look rather bored out of their mind here that is not to say that the animals are not well taken care of but animals in general spend  of their time sleeping so i did not get much out of looking at sleepy animals at times there are certain areas that stink from animal smell the worst was the flamingo section do not let soft pink feathers trick you into to thinking they are refreshing to stand around whew they stunk my favorite part of the zoo was probably the fragile rain forest section where you are in a sort of mini ecosphere of sorts commingling with squirrel bats mousedeer or deermouses a rather bizarre creature i would never heard of that looks literally like a midget deer with mouse like timidity was kind of freaky but neat how it scurried right by me on the path the bats are rather intimidating hanging within arms like of the observation area like dracula the tram ride is pretty helpful if you are lazy all in all if you are not much of a zoo person you will not have to worry about major regrets if you do not go there it is a pretty well laid out zoo but a zoo is a zoo much like how grease is grease sure some grease looks better than other grease but it is still grease there was a lot of info on the animals but they were often hidden from the tank they were in or enclosure they were in nothing too memorable to me other than the mousedeer,Negative
singapore-zoo,awesome zoo i have been to the singapore zoo a few times and can honestly say that each time i go i experience something unique i have never been to a zoo that has so many opportunities to directly interact with the animals for example i remember being appalled that those little lemur things right when you walk in are not in a cage they are just free to play in that one tree without restriction i was tempted to reach up and take one home with me there are also various shows and feeding times both of which are listed clearly on the map pamphlets given at the entrance the shows are pretty cheesy and the tricks kind of lame but then again i have never seen a show with so many different animals before and so much crowd participation the feeding times are also pretty cool for a small fee i think s  you can feed the giraffes etc soooo awesome make sure you bring a friend or a maid everyone in south east asia seems to have a maid to take pictures of you food options inside the zoo are limited to kfc and the zoo cafeteria the food in the cafeteria is surprisingly good and reasonably priced a meal for under  in a tourist attraction is unheard of in the the us however you can bring in food and drinks if you are super frugal i mean if you are wealthy enough to have a maid you should be able to afford to buy lunch there obviously i am still bitter that i cannot hire a maid  anyways i think the singapore zoo is great definitely a must see in singapore,Positive
singapore-zoo,i think i decided to visit the zoo on one of my stopovers because i remembered enjoying it when i was three years old we booked a tour to pick us up from the downtown area and did the breakfast with orangutans the tour was very organized and breakfast was pretty delicious they had a fun mix of western foods and local favorites the orangutans stuck around for a while long enough for everyone who booked the breakfast to take photos with them and the babies after breakfast we wandered around a few exhibits and enjoyed the tram ride the zoo was very much what i remembered when i was younger and it is been very well preserved i loved that a lot of the exhibits were open air without cages what a great way to spend a morning,Positive
singapore-zoo,probably my favorite attraction in singapore perhaps not super easy to get to with public transport but an easy taxi ride away from the city it is perfect to come when they open to make it before the crowds and strolling around the grounds to look at the well organized zoo they have a great range of animals and most of them seem to have very nice areas where they are held i am especially impressed by the range of african animals and i always enjoy seeing the lions cheetahs pumas and tigers the monkeys allowed to move around freely inside the zoo are also fun to see the park have a lot of extra and special events that one can pay for but to me just the standard parts are good enough and well worth the entrance fee i almost always visit the zoo whenever i am in singapore as it also provides a nice break from the crowds in the more central parts of town,Positive
singapore-zoo,this is the best zoo i have visited the zoo is very clean and well kept the animals all have large cages and lots of room to move around especially the orangutans and other monkeys there are so many animals to see i particularly enjoyed the white tigers elephants orangutans and polar bear there are also a lot of gardens with beautiful flowers to see as you are walking around the zoo the only downside to this zoo is transportation to get there as it is all the way on the west side and can be a long travel time,Positive
singapore-zoo,up to date this is my all time favorite zoo i though the berlin zoo was great this was even better with bigger exhibits and more animals i realized after going to a few zoos that i really like photographing animals and the singapore zoo allows you to do just that they have motes that keep the animal away from you yet you are close enough to see them without a fence or a cage the results are amazing highlights white tigers giant pandas now a part of river safari gay lions orangutans and various other monkeys elephants showgo early or late if you want to see active animals do not complain that they are sleeping when its the middle of the day with the sun at its highest point if you do not want to be outside they do not either,Positive
singapore-zoo,the singapore zoo is such a well kept and maintained zoo like all places in singapore this zoo is so clean the conservation scientists on staff love to interact with the visitors and i remember fondly all the times i would badger them with my superfluous questions they were so incredibly patient with me and even let me touch a few animals i study zoology now so you can only imagine how curious i was back then my favorite part about this zoo is that the animals are treated tremendously well which is something i do not see often when i am traveling a lot of animals are able to wander freely around the zoo not only is it great for the animals but also great for the curious visitor in addition to great day time programs they have a phenomenal night tour which i would highly recommend all attendees to take part in the gift shops are also fun and have great quality merchandise for sale this zoo gets  stars for being impeccably clean and well maintained truly loving their animals and taking care of their guests if you are in singapore make sure you give this place a shot,Positive
singapore-zoo,great zoo cheap to get into and lots to see and do shame it is so hot and humid and i come from the tropics   for a slushy and you get a souvineer cup only  can fare from marina bay sands,Positive
singapore-zoo,if you ask me what is the best singapore attraction that i would introduce to a tourist visiting i will definitely say it is the singapore zoo on a saturday morning the zoo was packed with visitors tickets are selling at  per adult when we got in we were approached by the staff to help us take a photo it was professional standard the exploration started with the tree trail walk and along the way to the pm show we saw white tigers and etc i would recommend everyone to follow the feeding time given by singapore zoological as it really adds alot of fun to the trip in particular the feeding of the baboons white tigers lions otters chimpanzees were the more interesting one you get to see the animals awake and trying ways to get their food the zoo also introduced a newly renovated kidzworld where you will see children playing around and getting wet in the water another thing that i like about the place is that tourist can really get up close with the animals you will see monkeys around and near you also get to take photograph together with the star animals with a fee the zoo close around pm and you may want to consider visiting the night safari after dinner if the zoo is not enough for you,Positive
singapore-zoo,i finally visited a zoo again my last visit was about four years ago the place has not changed much but why fix what is not broken the place remains as green and lush as ever with many animals roaming the compound freely to interact with visitors my memory is not perfect but i think they did add some animals or removed some there are also a lot more dining options than i remember and the kids area has been completely revamped with lots of water fun the queue for tickets and entrance builds up from  am onwards so it pays to arrive early the whole park is huge anyway so if you want to explore the entire place it is best to reserve one full day definitely a must visit for everyone in singapore and if you have not been here in a while be sure to check it out,Positive
singapore-zoo,very interesting place for education purpose but i do not like turtles are put inside alligator pool feel like they are waiting to be dead by alligator and why only one polar bear is kept inside glass world will he be so lonely too,Negative
singapore-zoo,among the zoos i have been to the singapore zoo is the place where i did not feel stressed and overwhelmed despite its popularity to the tourists and locals the place still managed to appear like a sanctuary for these animals located outside the city it is amazing how accessible the place is when commuting with just a bus ride from amk interchange you can just sit back relax and enjoy your ride towards the zoo i loved how the zoo is laid out animals are categorized based on the location and environment they would be commonly found ofcourse who could forget the small monkey by the bridge basking in the attention guests give him or her and the big ones on the trees hollering their greetings to the spectators we got the ticket that gave us whole day access to the boat and tram so talk about getting you are money is worth when we visited this place we had our mind set at seeing the white tiger apparently so did a hundred of other guests but needless to say it was not a rowdy environment and the animal is areas are relatively huge so there is a lot of room to wander hence we enjoyed every glimpse of it we missed out on the interaction with the kangaroos and riding the elephants so we are definitely going back for that kids and kids at heart this place is an absolute perfect venue for day is worth of enjoyment,Positive
singapore-zoo,i honestly do not like to go to the zoo for many reasons reptiles esp snakes dirty and stinky i was reluctant to go to the zoo in singapore but i am glad i took the chance the zoo was clean and well taken care of the animals look calm and happy i heard they rescued many animals including the cute elephants from the elephants show they were rescued from thailan and indonesia you can feed the animals for only  feeding the elephants was one of the best moment at the zoo they are such gentle giants i suggest to plan on spending at least half a day there i like the flow and feel of the whole zoo easy to navigate there are shades everywhere so we did not have to worry about the sun or rain i also feel very up close to the animals great place is visit even for adults,Positive
singapore-zoo,hands down world is greatest zoo in the world sh ts on the zoo back at home dare to compare try googling it i told you so have you ever seen free range monkeys in the zoo so close to range you can pet it those itty bitty monkeys the size of your arm have you ever roam around next to a free range lemur and so close that if you have a cucumber you can actually feed it actually you cannot bring your own cucumber but if you happen to find one on the floor that it missed just put it out and it comes to you free range bats orangutan deer rats etc and it is beautiful there i feel like i am walking around a rainforest to tell you the truth i am against zoo i hate them it is depressing it is wrong i only went because my brother visited sg and wanted to go so badly i felt obliged to take him glad i did i strongly believe all zoos should be like singapore is by standard,Positive
singapore-zoo,this zoo was mind blowing it definitely takes the cake i love the open feel we decided to do the orangutan breakfast after a fellow singaporean yelper recommended it best advice thanks kathryn the breakfast was a normal buffet spread with some pretty tasty curry once everyone has had a chance to eat they start bringing out the exotic life first was a ball python named boris you could line up to hold him and take photos next came the marmosets so freaking cute you could get pretty close to take photos and i asked the handler to take some shots with my camera and he obliged finally they call to the orangutans and it is really a sight to behold with the zoo being free range it feels like they are descending from everywhere overhead down to a  tiered platform the keepers lay out some fruit to keep the orangutans interested and you can observe them very closely and even take photos with them i loved it near by the breakfast while we were waiting for the arrival of the orangutans they had asian elephants you could feed you get a small basket of fruit and you can hand feed the elephants touch their heads and trunks possibly get splashed very cool it really allows for you to get up close photos too there is a rainforest area you can walk into it is sealed off there are butterflies inside huge spiders a small group of lemurs tiny mousedeer running across your path a sloth and flying fox i loved that you are sooo close to these amazing creatures the true highlight of the zoo for me was the panda preview it not totally open yet but we could pay an additional  dollars and see the exhibit even if there was not a panda the air conditioning alone was worth it the back story on the pandas is pretty cool too to celebrate the th anniversary of sino singapore relations in  the chinese government presented singapore with a gift a  year loan of a pair of male and female giant pandas singapore has become the ninth country to be privileged with the reception of the giant pandas from china since  kia kia and jia jia are not alone in the panda sanctuary either there is a red panda as well super cute and did a lot of posing for me there is also a kitchen and research centre that visitors can view not to miss out on sales opportunities you can even get a panda shaped bao called panda pau when you exit and see the panda cafe all the panda accesories gifts etc can only be purchased at the gift store once you exit the sanctuary be sure to get anything panda related you want there because it is your last chance the last highlight for me was the otters i love me some otters these little furry guys would come right up to you expecting food standing up and looking all cute loved it you can pick up a feeding time schedule when you enter the park and i recommend following it for the best views of the animals you want to see up close with how amazed i was with this experience i can only imagine how cool the night safari is,Positive
singapore-zoo,for me this is a best zoo in the world except that it is so hot and humid which make it so un comfortable to enjoy the zoo for long hours i have been to the zoo many times but the best part this time was seeing the panda love it highly recommend,Positive
singapore-zoo,best zoo ever my husband used to live in singapore in the s and he recalled many fond memories visiting the zoo when he was in elementary school when we visited recently he said the zoo has really changed and for the better the website says it is the world is best rainforest zoo and i could not agree more the grounds are very beautiful with lush greenery everywhere all the rain we get must be a great help towards the maintenance of this place i felt that this environment really helps in making the animals feel more in their natural habitat we loved how there were a lot of free range animals i thought these free range displays were what really set the singapore zoo apart from the rest of the zoos i have visited the free ranging orangutans were my favorite they are so fun to watch because they climb everywhere there is also another area with birds and butterflies that flutter around freely in addition to small animals that are not aggressive towards humans being from the us i would never seen so many of these different animal species from australia and asia so it was a real treat my only regret is not getting tickets to see the pandas they sell out quick so it is best to make an effort to get them in advance make sure you bring your camera photo opportunities abound here next up night safari i want to go to there sooooo bad,Positive
singapore-zoo,awesome this is coming from a person who dislikes zoos and animals being in cages most of the inhabited areas for the animals were similar to their actual living in the wild i did not get bored and i liked the kid park at one end of the park it provided a break for my little ones they were able to feed a few animals watch a few shows take a few photos with animals and even ride the elephant they enjoyed themselves i did as well,Positive
singapore-zoo,the singapore zoo has to be by far the cleanest zoo that i have ever visited anywhere it has a good selection of animal attractions and they all seem to be well taken care of and happy many of the attractions are not merely animals in cages but they are in open habitats which is a good thing i saw a polar bear in an enclosed tank that you could watch swim below the water i never saw a polar bear swim so much there is a terrific orangutan habitat also that contains about  orangutans which also have overhangs that they climb from the zoo also features shows the asian and african elephant show a animals of the rainforest flight back show there are also various animal feedings that you can participate for a  singapore dollar fee the price of adult admission for  including the fee for the tram was  singapore dollars the tram has  stops throughout the zoo and you could pay at the stop as well one of the nicest zoos that i have ever visited,Positive
singapore-zoo,i need to go back to the san diego zoo as an adult and see if it impressed me as much as this place you have opportunities to not only watch a multitude of feedings but participate in them as well we also splurged and did the breakfast with orangutans and had ourselves a great breakfast and an awesome opportunity to see these amazing creatures up close and learn a bit about their plight all in all it was a great place to visit we did the three park hopper and i would say if you have or are going to kuala lumpar do not bother with the three park hopper and instead get a two park hopper that will get you into the zoo and night safari the bird park was not really that incredible we were much more impressed with the one in kl,Positive
singapore-zoo,fantastic zoo with great variety we did not get to try the night safari or river safari but even the regular zoo was great most of the animals are not behind cages or glass and you really feel a connection to them the walk through habitat with the flying foxes sloths ducks and lemurs that walk right up to you was incredible and the coolest thing ever at a zoo the treetops walk and orangutans that can swing right up to you were also very cool great for people of all ages not just kids,Positive
singapore-zoo,we are going to the zoo zoo zoo how about you you you you can come too too too hah now you have this annoying song planted in your head those were the days when commercials worked with children these days you tell the kids you are bringing them to the zoo they ask if it is something that houses angry birds no no angry birds there only full of parrots and other birds that can talk wait that is jurong bird park the animals in singapore zoo are known at least in my circles for being creatures of sloth and that higher than thou attitude the singaporean culture has gotten to them obviously or it might just be the heat the tigers and lions sleep and the polar bears hide whenever we visit the kangaroos and crocodiles do not move an inch the most active group of animals in the zoo are the primates they act like they own the place most action can be caught here if not keep to the feeding times or animal shows,Negative
singapore-zoo,i absolutely love zoos this zoo reminded me of the sydney toronga zoo and turns out they are sister zoos of all the zoos i have been to this might just be the second best zoo right behind toronga the zoo was really clean and organized and smelled like you were at a beautiful park with flowers everywhere my favorite animal was the white tiger he just looked so majestic and i honestly think i can just stand there and watch him for hours i did not have that much time at the zoo so did not get to see every animal i did not like how you had to pay a separate fee to see the pandas so i skipped that my family and i took the park tram because we got tired of walking everywhere you cover majority of the park that way if you are on a time crunch there is a restaurant called ah meng which just happens to be my middle name so exciting haha so i bought an iced tea there i was really bummed i could not experience the famous night safari since i went during the day but i will def have to check that out when i go to singapore again,Negative
singapore-zoo,been to many a zoo mostly in the usa but in other parts of the world i must say that the singapore zoo is about the best it is well run clean safe and the animal seem well cared for unlike many zoo you can get close to may of the non aggressive animals and the other animals are not in enclosure that are a long distance away so viewing is pretty good i have been to the singapore zoo twice and each time i found it enjoyable what is also nice is that it is next to the night safari and the river trip plan on going to the zoo during the day later in the afternoon then going to the night safari afterwards saves a trip back the zoo is well worth going there the only drawback that there is not a direct bus from the mrt station that i could figure out so taking a taxi was the best option for me,Positive
singapore-zoo,this is probably the best zoo i have been to i do not remember being as excited to see as many animals at any other zoo the reason why it was the best for me was that i got to see some pretty cool animals such as the white tiger leopard giant tortoise and komodo dragon i also saw the same animals i have seen elsewhere such as lions and tigers in addition to many others and in these cases i got to actually see the animal what i mean by this during my visits at other zoos the animals are usually sleeping or laying down in the corner or behind a rock where you cannot see them here they are actually around and easy to see like other zoos there were a variety of shows that were cheesy yet entertaining i do recommend the elephant show but did not really care for the other ones i watched the elephant show was entertaining and the elephants were impressive and you have the opportunity to feed the elephants afterward at a low price do not remember about  for a basket yes basket not one or two pieces of fruit there was also a variety of feedings you can do we did not make any of those another thing i would have liked to try but missed was riding the elephant it was only  we went to cambodia after singapore and it cost  to ride the elephant there overall i had a good time despite the heat and humidity and would recommend coming here,Negative
singapore-zoo,awesome so much fun but if you were trying to do  or  attractions you do not need to be there at  am so plane at least   hours each park not  lol my fault,Negative
singapore-zoo,now i have only been to a few zoos but of the ones i have been to this is definitely one of the better ones first off the queue to get in is very long due to all the tourists like me of course once you are in there are so many sections to visit now they do offer in their admission for an additional charge a tram ride that will save you some walking we bought that but did not end up taking the tram we basically walked from one area to the next which in the humidity was rather challenging anyway coming here brought out my inner child i was walking wide eyed from one animal to the next there were so many animals some of which i have never seen i think my face formed an automatic smile when i saw the white tigers this is a first for me they were absolutely gorgeous one of them was pacing back and forth completely oblivious of the gawkers some other highlights are the komodo dragon and giant desert tortoise i have only heard of the komodo dragon but never had the fortune to see them live they look every bit as impressive as the pictures the giant desert tortoises were absolutely grand they just lay in front of the fence and stare at us staring at them i saw other big cats such as the cheetah and leopard and other animals such as the hippo rhino and elephant speaking of the elephant for  we could feed them that was a fun experience watching them take the food with their trunk to place in their mouth the animal shows were enjoyable as well we saw the elephant show and one about conserving the environment both were informative and entertaining i highly recommend visiting the singapore zoo and if you do be sure to go during the weekend because that is when you can feed the animals for a fee of course,Positive
singapore-zoo,a great place to keep the whole family entertained but be sure to make your way there early or risk standing in line to get your tickets it is not your average queue if you thought opening day at h m was crazy this is at least  times worse the main attraction at the zoo for me personally would be the chimps you have watched rise of the planet of the apes so i am sure you know how smart chimps are that aside try making faces at the chimps and check out their response to you there are tons of other interesting animals ofcourse but i would say the chimps are the most entertaining and fascinating,Negative
singapore-zoo,i went to the zoo often enough as a child now i only head down to the zoo on ben jerry is free cone day because it is the nearest branch to home it is usually more quiet at this branch than others and boy as word spread the queue gets longer every year what i really like about our zoo is that the environment has been made as natural as possible for the animals and that the animals are well treated the enclosures are also kept clean and well taken care of if you are visiting with kids i suggest you walk around the zoo first before taking them to the playground the playground is a hit with the kids so do not say i did not warn you if they wo not leave,Positive
singapore-zoo,the singapore zoo is my second favorite zoo my first favorite zoo is the steve irwin zoo in australia with that being said absolutely fantastic i must say monkeys that are climbing and swinging high above you are head as you walk through parts of the part the white tigers are beautiful and you can feed the elephants for a small cost the park itself is beautiful and clean looking out over the water reminds you that you are in beautiful asia do yourselft a favor and buy the dual ticket to the zoo and night safari it is worth it,Positive
singapore-zoo,one of the few attractions to open early in singapore at   a m and it is a good idea to take advantage of that to beat the heat and the crowds the jungle breakfast lets diners get up close with the zoo is impressive orangutans the first of many shows that drive home the zoo is mantra of conservation the rainforest kidzworld bring swimsuits is popular and the acclaimed open conceptdesign brings visitors right up to the animal habitatscheck on the feeding time and animal show timings sit further away during animal show if do not want to get wet,Positive
singapore-zoo,orangutans lions penguins polar bears children you will find all types of animals at the zoo one of singapore is top tourist attractions frequented by locals as well i used to come here quite often as a child i am not the biggest fan of zoos trapping animals in artificial enclosures but as far as they go the singapore zoo is impressively big and attempts to re create as naturalistic environment for the animals as possible they keep the animals in large open enclosures surrounded by moats and they appear to be fairly well treated although i have my doubts about elephant rides which are pretty cruel google it some of the main attractions my favourite animals include orangutans you can get your picture taken with them and i think you still get to dine with them in special sessions the majestic white tigers the elephant show these amazing creatures perform tricks and there is a feeding session after that if you can take the at times unbearable heat a day at the zoo learning about animals is always an enjoyable and informative one just remember to bring lots of mosquito repellant,Positive
singapore-zoo,zoo has a number of endangered threatened species good photographic opportunities need a flash due to heavy canopy of trees very friendly and helpful staff nice walkable layout with a very good map great selection of beverages food bring rain gear lots of taxies if visiting the zoo more than  days buy a membership and have unlimited access and it helps the zoo rent wagon to haul you gear,Positive
singapore-zoo,the singapore zoo is by far one of the best zoos in the world what is amazing how you see some of the creatures move freely within the park and there quarters they designed the zoo for visitors to have a great experience and to feel close to the animals a must see in singapore,Positive
singapore-zoo,the last time i visited the singapore zoo was back in primary school during an excursion eons later in  i went back and relived the joys of being around marvellous animals needless to say i had a ball of a time there i love how the place is so clean and litter free especially the lovely alfresco style washrooms for the shows the elephants at work play as well as rainforest fights back shows are a must see the former features some really adorable young elephants with brute strength while the latter rallies the rainforest gang consisting spider monkeys orang utans and otters my favourite exhibit involves the extremely cute sun bears the smallest breed of bears they are usually hiding and playing though so it is not often that you can face them but catching a glimpse of these adorable exotic creatures is good enough for me another highlight is of course the kidzworld which even incorporates a water park and playground parents and anyone who has lived in the s to s eras should also visit the kampung house located there for a sense of nostalgia you will find typewriters and old school television sets amongst many other antique trinkets,Positive
singapore-zoo,travel alot and always stop by the local zoo and this one take my top spot being from san diego the zoo there sets the standard along with the wild animal park but singapore zoo blew it away if you have the chance definitely a absolute stop,Positive
singapore-zoo,by far the coolest zoo ever i went to the night safari and it was awesome there was a trolley that took us throughout the zoo and showed us all types of wildlife animals i must admit that it was a little nerving knowing there was no barrier between us and the wild but the animals were far enough away from us for the most part every few minutes the tour guides would stop the trolley and let us out to explore designated areas to check out other smaller animals they had a bat cage but i was too freaked out to go in afterwards we went into the souvenir shops and left had an amazing time definately check this zoo out especially at night,Negative
singapore-zoo,the singapore zoo is incredible it is the best zoo i have been to all the animals looked well cared for and most were not pacing or looking bored the cage free design makes it especially easy to take pictures by public transportation it takes almost  hours from marina bay taking a shuttle from chinatown or little india is probably worth it,Positive
singapore-zoo,my daughter and i had a great day here while travelling round the world highlights  the white tigers the orang utans the elephant rides this is a must see if you are travelling to singapore,Positive
singapore-zoo,beautiful tropical cageless zoo the day zoo is my favorite place in singapore hands down it should deserve at least half a day on every visitor is list even if you do not like zoos normally this one is different,Positive
singapore-zoo,singapore zoo was a marvelous place when i visited as a  year old child i recall many innovative designs in terms of how the space was laid out there are very few cages and you often look down on the dangerous animals in a way that seems like you are right there elephant rides were a real treat and i also remember an exotic bird literally sitting on a tree in the middle of the pedestrian path ground breaking stuff,Positive
singapore-zoo,best zoo i have ever been to you can even have breakfast with the orangutans monkeys are running around freely i would also recommend you visit the night safari i think you can buy a ticket that includes both places,Positive
din-tai-fung,clean safe for stomach michelin star restaurant with the prices of the foodcourt all dtfs i visited in singapore were great,Positive
din-tai-fung,this is my third din tai fung but i like this one you know immediately they do a good job on their special dumplings xiao long bao the restaurant is at orchard road most of the wait time is about  minutes i waited only  minutes as usual i order the crab xiao long bao it is soupy and crab egg in it very good the soup here is better than my previous two other locations i got the shrimp dumplings it is half moon shape the only thing i would said is good finally i have try one of their specialty the black truffle xiao long bao it is rare item each piece cost  sg the make of this dumplings is with black truffle it doe carry plenty soup it it it has great taste the food come out quick service to the table is attentive i would said is a way to move the customer to create space for the people who waited,Positive
din-tai-fung,when you are used to   hour waits in los angeles to eat here and pay much higher prices it is like heaven eating here in singapore where you can just walk in sit down and eat i can report that f here at the wisma atria shopping center felt to me as if i were in foodie heaven so many choices and in the middle of this chaos of food teasing is din tai fung we sat down and were promptly served two orders of xiao long bao and felt pacified as the soup explosion in my mouth placed me in a state foodie hypnosis and that was just the regular order we then order the one with truffle flavoring and i felt like buddha must felt when he found himself in reclining position as he attained nirvana seriously i really enjoyed the quality here and feel as if i have cheated the entire state of california whole will wait another  hours before they can sit down and have about  of the quality of xlb that are here we also had the drunken chicken simple and excellent then for a refreshment i had the grass jelly drink perfect then we had a mushroom and minced pork with noodle dish simple and perfect all in all singapore when it comes to food is like placing money on bets you will never lose that is what happened here tonight this foodie is one happy man,Positive
din-tai-fung,still awesome xiao long bao and fried wontons i had the crab xiao long bao and seafood pork fried wontons very good taste,Positive
din-tai-fung,i love din tai fung i live for their soup dumplings i have officially been to their los angeles costa mesa hong kong and shanghai locations now cannot wait to conquer more locations dtf has a good selection of dishes soup dumplings are excellent cucumber with chilli sauce dish is very refreshing pork wontons is a new dish i tried while in hong kong and now i am going to get it every time,Positive
din-tai-fung,i am a big fan of dtf and have been to many locations in the usa and taiwan even went to the original so when we had this opportunity we jumped at it after we arrived we were seated right away we ordered items we usually order and the first item the cucumber appetizer it was served cut lengthwise and had an odd sauce and odd taste the food in general was just ok and the service was slow and inattentive left the restaurant disappointed which never happens if this had been my first experience i would most likely never go back,Negative
din-tai-fung,how can everything here be so delicious i think i had dim sum approximately four times during my one week trip to singapore and this was definitely the best of all of them we did not have to wait too long to get seated and we were able to decide on what to order while we waited so our food was ready very quickly once we sat down i honestly do not remember everything we had i just ate and felt happy there were a couple highlights though xiaolongbao delicious i have often had xlb where the soup has leaked out by the time you eat it all not the case here full of soup perfectly complemented by the ginger and vinegar truffle xiaolongbao if you like super strong truffle flavor you could probably eat many of these i could only eat one but it felt like the most decadent xlb i have ever had chili crab bun what is not to love chili crab combined with the fluffiest bun heavenly fried rice i could have eaten the whole plate enough said chocolate red bean dumpling i have never tried a dessert dumpling before and i was a little skeptical of chocolate and red bean combined in a dumpling but it was delicious the flavors match really well and the chocolate is so nice and melty be sure to save room for this din tai fung really is the best and it lives up to the hype,Positive
din-tai-fung,this din tai fung is located on the th floor next to japan food town was there on a saturday for late lunch the staff at the entrance gave me a number and a paper pen so i could check what i liked to order while waiting the wait was not bad at all good thing i did not have to stand in line think i ever mentioned in my other post i do not like to stand in line period staffs were all friendly and attentive i like that the restaurant has those bag holders stands like those in taste paradise which allow female customers to store their purses or bags of cos those at taste paradise were a lot better since they came with a flap attached to secure the top the ones at din tai feng were open bag holders which the staff would just put a cloth over it ok i know i can be so nitpicking food  the legendary xiao long bao steamed dumplings were yummy as expected i also ordered one red bean bun and one meat bun just to try they were tiny but were good ambience  it was noisy but i did not expect it to be calm and quiet it was not a place i would suggest for a first date more like a place for friends to catch up or family lunch staffs  staffs were attentive helpful and polite water was filled up constantly,Negative
din-tai-fung,first things first do not be alarmed when your party is food does not arrive at the same time the plates are delivered as they come out of the kitchen you will see this throughout singapore another thing pay your bill on the way out of the restaurant waitstaff do not have access to cash registers now onto the good stuff do not judge this restaurant for being nestled in a mall this is not food court food it is a fun dining experience with delicious options for most diets vegan options are not available order up and share with your table for the best experience what we shared dumplings vegetable pork chicken vegetarian shrimp pork shao maithe dumplings were delicious and being able to share with the rest of my group made for a really enjoyable dining experience i rounded out my meal with the egg fried rice pretty standard and the red bean xiaolongbao for dessert try this try this try this,Positive
din-tai-fung,try the dragon boat dumplings and tea especially the savory version very nice this time i also bought their own chilli oil and chilli sauce to use at home hubby likes it a lot,Positive
din-tai-fung,we are from the us and it seemed odd going to a food court to eat but this place was great fast service and a nice view onto the street the steamed buns were good and the spicey cucumber,Positive
din-tai-fung,our favorite dumpling restaurant always fresh always delicious if you can find a location for din tai fung near you i highly recommend visiting it is also very family friendly for young kids,Positive
din-tai-fung,food is so evarage very few options and low quality of food the crab soup dumplings is stink which is very unacceptable nothing special,Negative
din-tai-fung,was in singapore last week and went to the dtf on orchard road it was so good that i went back a second time on monday evening there was no wait for a table on friday we waited  minutes i have been at three of these places in  different countries taiwan usa and singapore and all were terrific,Positive
din-tai-fung,just okdefinitely overpriced for the quality and quantity want tap water be ready to fork out  cents not the money just ridiculous to charge for tap water food was nothing special wished we had eaten at the hawker stands in front of this restaurant instead of here would have been cheaper and probably better,Negative
din-tai-fung,could not decide what to eat and stumbled on dtf i have had such high expectations for their soup dumplings that when they came out i was a little disappointed not to say they were not good or anything because they were but just overly hyped the dumplings are small and succulent the drunken chicken was moist and full of alcohol i do not think it is a  star restaurant but it is good,Negative
din-tai-fung,andrew and i always wondered how din tai fung dtf can consistently keep their rich flavour after opening many branches around the world we visited a few din tai fung restaurants when we were in singapore and were blown away at their good quality control at the same time we also thought that we were just lucky two things that we always ordered in din tai fung were their shrimp pork shao mai and of course the  folds original xiao long bao dtf is xiao long bao is really in the league of their own honestly we never found any broken dumpling skin although i never really counted the number of folds on their dumpling the shao mai was also always very delicious with plenty of pork meats inside i always add vinegar to shao mai and the xiao long bao as i love the additional sour flavour on the meat of course the price of their dishes are more than the other chinese restaurants but the quality never disappoints us,Positive
din-tai-fung,i had my first xlb experience in august when i waited over  minutes to eat at din tai fung in seattle it was well worth the wait and when i found out that there are locations all over singapore i had to make a visit this location is located on the top floor of the wisma atria which was super easy to get to from the grand hyatt where we were staying i was delighted when we did not have to wait at all and were seated immediately they even set a carrier next to our table for all of our packages from shopping i liked that a lot i ordered the braised beef noodles and pork xlb which was what i had ordered in seattle everything was delicious i love that the xlb is consistent and still amazing no matter where you go to in the world i did notice that the braised beef in my noodles was a lot more fatty that the meat pieces in seattle perhaps it is the geographical preference another thing i noticed was my friend and i were practically the only asian people in the restaurants making me think there are probably many xlb restaurants that give dtf a run for their money but no matter love the xlb here and had a great lunch,Positive
din-tai-fung,a great place for dim sum for a gathering with a few family and friends   looks really nice from outside until you get closer to the kitchen seems a bit dis organized but they do get your orders asap nothing unique about their dishes that stood out but i had not tried everything a bit pricey for dimsum in singapore,Positive
din-tai-fung,first of all the wait was not too long and then the service is just incredible here never a minute where my water was not being refilled now to talk about the food absolutely best soup dumplings i have ever had in my life and soooo much food for a very reasonable price came hungry left full and happy my favorite menu items were xiao li bing and the oriental vinegar salad only thing i would steal clear from here is the pickled mustard with meat otherwise superb food service and atmosphere planning to come back again before we leave singapore,Positive
din-tai-fung,din tai fung the champion of dim sum this place is always packed and you often have to wait but once you get your seat it is time for business oder and order and just wait for the steaming baskets of goodness appear at your table everything is so yummy you can not go wrong have fun,Positive
din-tai-fung,a decent location crazy busy and poor service though love my local din tai fung in losangeles this place did not meet expectations they also did not have the shanghai ricecakes which are a must have,Negative
din-tai-fung,the food overall was good highly recommended chilicrab bun it is a must beancurd vermicelli are quite good as well service well the waiter doesnt really speak english so we had some communication problem i was quite surprise since the restaurant is located in orchard road you would expected them to be able to communicate in english the service fee is only around  and this is not including tips,Positive
din-tai-fung,good service delicious food often visit this restaurantbras basahrafflesnexrwswismaand other i forgot,Positive
din-tai-fung,din tai fung is always a good shout i cannot believe they do not have it in every major city in the world the pork chop fried rice steamed garlic spinach noodles with spicy sauce stuffed chillis the dtf salad and of course their xiao long bao are all to die for there is a lot more on the menu to choose from but those are my favourites the waiting time can be long if you are going during the peak hours but that is normal for any dtf in the city the system they have keeps everything going smoothly and if you do have to wait long it will be worth it the only thing that is annoying and it seems to a problem at all of their outlets is that most of the people working there do not speak english well in singapore this should be a necessity however with the way ordering works you really do not need to speak to the staff other than when you need to pay everyone i have taken to din tai fung has loved it and i cannot imagine why you would not,Positive
din-tai-fung,came here after searching around the whole shopping centre for a good place to eat the wait time was around minutes but we were given a menu and ordering sheet while we waited so by the time we sat down we had already ordered and the food came very soon after we sat down the dumplings were great as was the egg fried rice the drinks were quite pricey sgd for a can of coke the only cheap option was the cent tap water which they came round to refill a few times however the food was good value sgd for lunch for  people and this was cheap compared to most of the other lunch restaurants in the mall,Positive
din-tai-fung,after touring on the singapore hop on hop off yellow bus for the morning we spotted a familiar restaurant from china and the us din tai fung known for their delicate siu loong baus since we were hungry for a late lunch we hopped off at the orchard road stop and headed upstairs to l of the japanese shopping center had the vinegar based salad shanghainese chicken pork siu loong baus and minced pork mushroom noodles tea refilled constantly high quality food and service consistent with the chain having non chain restaurant food tonight,Positive
din-tai-fung,delicious dumplings and vegetable dishes not too many options for pork allergies almost every dumpling has pork alongside the other protein,Positive
din-tai-fung,the sun set as the darkness came quickly at around pm having exposed ourselves exploring singapore under extreme heat we could not help but finding ourselves dining in a cool ac top notch restaurant like ding tai fung this taiwanese establishment is located right in the heart of orchard area famously known for its xiao long bao ding tai fung also features a bunch of other dimsum goodness which we were determined to try them all out we started with a refreshing dish of oriental salad the salad was crunchy and delicious with standout ingredients like bean sprouts korean glass noodles and vinegar which we believe is a perfect match to create the appetite since vinegar dressing salad is our favorite afterwards here came our steamed pork dumplings xiao long bao steamed shrimp pork shaomai steamed vegetable pork buns and steamed finely mashed red bean dumplings of course the spotlight should be given xiao long bao sipping the water inside each bao is wonderful the inside meat is well flavored recommendation xiao long bao oriental saladread our full review at thecoupleeats com singap,Positive
din-tai-fung,tried the outlet at paragon mall we ordered chicken and mushroom dumplings which were all right not too sure what the hype is about as similar dumplings are available at many other places in singapore incl food courts at much lower prices and quicker service infact they had quite a limited range of dumplings if you dont want to havr pork considering a wait time oustide and at the table and higher prices didnt find it that much value for money,Positive
din-tai-fung,back in california there is usually a line hour deep for dtf i was surprised that at around pm there was no line or wait at all here in singapore same delicious yummy dumplings but sans line the xlb is what you get here if you did not know you can get other stuff but the xlb is what you should put down in the box as soon as you sit down the food came out quickly the cold sliced beef the xlb the pan fried shirmp pancake was delicious the beer was cold and served promptly i wish i had a dtf near me that was like this no lines no waiting still yummy,Positive
din-tai-fung,xiao long baos are amazing as with their other outlets only complain would be the smell which somewhat resembles that of when you enter a gym would strongly recommend the yam xiaolongbaos filled with ornee as well as their crab meat xiao long baos,Positive
din-tai-fung,never go wrong with din tai fung in singapore food is value for money always the restaurant to go with when u are looking for casual family outing,Positive
din-tai-fung,omg another great meal and we totally just lucked into this place i was at orchard road with my mother and we had entered one of the shopping malls to purchase some stuff from lush and by the time the shopping was done it was closing on pm and we both were just super hungry i had noticed a food court level located in the same mall as the lust store so just took the elevetor up there and then looked at yelp reviews and this one come up tops honestly it was not a great first experience as when we approached the restaurant front of staff and asked about vegetarian options for my mother the lady said there was nothing vegetarian available but i asked to see menu and there clearly were veg options that mum said she was interested in trying so we got in and soon afterwards folks were turned away as the restaurant was closing at pm we hurriedly ordered pretty much at random from the menu to be honest and the list of foods ordered is in my photos but gosh all the food we got was so good and scrumptious each bite was a delight and i walked away super happy to have had the opportunity chance to eat here sometimes the food gods are truly with you my one regret however was that in rush of ordering did not get to try the xlb so am going to make it my mission once back in us next year to get myself to a dtf and try this foodie  new year resolution,Negative
din-tai-fung,the food was tasty enough but it did not live up to the hype i would go again with someone who likes to eat here but would not choose it myself,Negative
din-tai-fung,fantastic location and food i heard you have to practice for  year before they let you prepare food for customers,Positive
din-tai-fung,extra points just for being seated right away we got there at around   in the us two hour waits can be the norm but there are just too many good food options here in singapore this din tai fung was conveniently located in the wisma atria mall on there th floor by the way another incredible food court on this level as well and was right across the street from our hotel wanting to see how it compares to the one in bellevue wa we had an early lunch here we ordered seaweed salad and tofu with honey sauce appetizers both were good i had the seaweed salad before but the tofu dish was new to me nice way to start the meal fried shrimp pancake this was new to me as well and was my favorite dish love how crispy and not greasy it was shrimp fried rice standard but good shrimp and chinese gourd dumplings just ok not that big of a fan of the gourd chili crab bun this was really good but you order them one each should have gotten another one overall very similar to the din tai fung is in the us no wait to be seated but we did have a long wait for our food though,Positive
din-tai-fung,i am in love instead of setting a portrait of my spouse on my bedside table when i travel to singapore i will be placing the business card from din tai fung which features a picture of a plump xiao long bao on the table next to my bed soft juicy pillows of steaming xiao long bao whispered delicious pork nothings to me last night during my first visit to the orchard branch of din tai fung how could i have been so blind to this love affair in the making what is so amazing about din tai fung is that it is a large chain restaurant by the breadtalk group a type of business that i would never or rarely patronize but the quality was simply decadent the service was average to nearly poor however the food was so spectacular the rating could be nothing less than than a five star,Positive
din-tai-fung,short wait for delicious food at a good price we made our order on paper while we were waiting,Positive
din-tai-fung,i went here by myself yesterday and arrived to a crazy long line because of the chinese new year holiday but to my surprise i was seated in about   minutes i think what took the longest about of time was really the food itself which came out about  minutes after being seated i was okay with this and knew to expect this because one of the servers informed me so i got the beef noodle soup spinach with garlic and the pork steamed dumplings the dumplings are a must they are perfectly chewy with a great depth of flavor with the soup meat itself the beef noodle soup just was not for me i do not think it is horrible but it just was not what i expected and the spinach was amazing as well it is definitely a must it was pretty affordable which i appreciated as well the reason why i gave it only  stars is because the overall experience was not great and i have to say that i have had better quality plates at other places but like a said it is definitely worth a try,Negative
din-tai-fung,food quality a miss for the second successive visit after years of admiring this place all round veggie delight fail more haha some genius decided to do away with free flow refills tea so now it is ordered per pot and you can sip tepid over brewed bitter tea after the first few minutes or continually re order a new pot another delight gone then mid meal need to close register so please stop eating chatting fumble find card wait while i go process come back to stop you again and sign off the card slip finally prices suddenly up almost x following an unnecessary facelift that feels like a downgrade way to go bread talk trouble brewing alongside the new tea pot idea stock at all time high business toppy will start to short some to make up for the x bill,Positive
din-tai-fung,gah the taro buns from this place still haunt my dreams i had no idea how delightful taro could possibly be but this is over the top it is a staple item for me to look for now on every menu of dtf and the second item i order after the soup dumplings din tai fung does it to me every time with their perfectly steamed items one you understand how to eat the steamed soup dumplings you will look for this place in every city you visit the soup dumplings are absolutely incredible but there are a few surprise dishes that are nearly as impressive the fried rice is absolutely delightful and there is a rice dish for dessert that looks like it has some melted jelly beans in it but i promise you is incredible the service is always prompt and efficient and the value for the quality you receive is impeccable,Positive
din-tai-fung,what is there to say about din tai fung that is not anything less than delicious tantalizingly juicy dumplings fast service and rich noodles whenever i am feeling a little homesick the first thing i crave are the delightful xiao long bao definitely the best in the world from dtf i have been to multiple locations in singapore my hometown the seattle location and the very first franchise in taiwan each one is slightly different but despite the subtle differences all of them are nothing short of amazing although the prices are slightly expensive the amount of food you get is worth the price everything on their menu is delectable i could eat here for every meal sincerely craving some xiao long boa,Positive
din-tai-fung,we came for an early dinner and managed to dodge the crowd the restaurant was still quite full and bustling for good reason the food was awesome not just the truffle dim sum but everything that came out of the kitchen dinner for two with complimentary tea came to s  window seats recommended if possible though you probably wo not have a choice the food court here is all around high quality we avoid orchard like the plague but will certainly be back to din tai fung if we are in the area,Positive
din-tai-fung,everything was incredible the pork dim sum was so fresh the chili crab stuffed bun delish spicy pork thingys unbelievable,Positive
din-tai-fung,i had heard so much about din tai fung that i was in a crazy pursuit after these bloody dumplings never making it until tonight first off staff is very nice mostly we arrived an hour before closing time before being able to order we were told which dumplings they had run out of my husband does not eat meat so it was not nice to hear that all of the fish dumplings and most of the vegetarian options were gone but then again we were late so we ordered a concoction of food that was mostly noodles and veggies and  pieces of crab meat pork dumplings for me the order was placed shortly after  pm everyone around us seemed to be getting food the place was relatively empty though fast our first order arrived at around   everything else in about  minute iterations with a staff member asking us at   if we wanted to place a last order which was a tad bizarre with no other food having arrived yet also we had the dumpling delivery people stopping by our table often only to carry on walking again after checking the contents pretty funny if you are not hungry that is we finally had nearly all of our food following a dumpling mix up when i was asked to pay and come to the till where i had to wait for someone else to pay back to my nearly cold food the last order arrived the crab meat pork dumplings with samples of black hair i stopped a waiter who immediately offered a replacement that took some time which made the whole experience very late with the supervisor apologising profusely for both the wait and the hair situation all in all food was just ok pretty bland two stars for the wait staff one for food i guess we just hit a bad day but i wo not be back especially since my husband found that there is a huge difference in quality between here and taipei taipei it shall be then next time,Negative
din-tai-fung,dim sum is the tapas of china the fact that it is the cheapest michelin star restaurant you will ever find with great food highly recommended,Positive
din-tai-fung,i am not an expert in this type of food so feel free to ignore me but i can only go on what my taste buds told me when i visited these may have been the most authentic buns and dumplings but they just did not taste as good as some other ones that i have eaten in the past a bit bland is probably the best way i can describe the food perhaps it was our selections that were off but there is a bit of pressure when you are not even allowed into the restaurant until you have picked your food genuinely had really high food hopes for this places based on previous reviews and personal local recommendations but for me it was all a bit meh taste wise just scrapes a  star rating for dumplings in a shopping centre,Negative
din-tai-fung,went to this place after several recommendations from family members the chain has received a michelin star the service was outstanding michelin service but not michelin prices their xiaolongbao are one of the best outside china we also loved their shanghai drunken chicken and their springrolls with duck and onion if you want to explore you may try the xiaolongbao with chili crab or truffles will indeed visit again,Positive
din-tai-fung,always good at dtf make sure you try the chili crab xlb not in menu great service and good recommendation,Positive
din-tai-fung,love love love dtf go out of my way to visit in other locations when i travel like san francisco and seattle reasonable price fast service and great tasting food they are not known for their customer service but the food makes up for it i will never have pork dumplings better than at dtf,Positive
din-tai-fung,the absolute best pork dumplings in town cheap and yummy they have a variety of dumplings but the pork ones are the best,Positive
din-tai-fung,consistently good food waitresses are all business almost like non human robots very efficiently run chain restaurant diners mark selections on a clipboard either while waiting for a table or immediately when seated we go about once a month all the locations are pretty consistent and we often tend to order the same things on each visit sliced cucumbers with garlic xiao long bao shrimp and pork dumplings shrimp and pork shumai pork buns fried rice with fried pork chop wontons with vinegar and chili oil are all extremely good there is often a wait for a table so the trick is to arrive early before the peak rush they open an hour earlier at am on weekends din tai fung is a great place to bring out of town visitors for dim sum even the most constipated westerner will find this food appealing,Positive
din-tai-fung,love love love dtf this one even have the red bean chocolate dessert which is different than other countries must try,Positive
din-tai-fung,simply delicious fresh tasting reasonably priced great attentive service location in mall makes access easy and comfortable for foreign visitors highly recommend,Positive
din-tai-fung,i love din tai fung my favorite thing there is the xiao long bao you can see them making it fresh and it tastes so good the beef noodles are great to because of the spice the spice gives the dish a lot of flavor also the fried rice is so flavorful and delicious and you cannot get better fried rice anywhere i would highly recommend din tai fung to anybody,Positive
din-tai-fung,i love this place i visit this place or one of the other din tai fung outlets at least once a month must try xiao long bao chili crab bun fried rice with pork braised beef noodles highly recommend trying the chili sauce also this place can get crowded so i recommend that you get a queue number early no reservations unfortunately for those who are not familiar with asian food i recommend that your group orders a number of dishes and shares everything asian way rather than each person ordering your own dishes you will get to try alot more food this way,Positive
din-tai-fung,ever since i came across paradise dynasty i have just completely abandoned din tai fung it does not help either that there seems to always be a line in this place but to their credit their service is fast succinct enough to ensure that you do not wait too long for your table their food are decent but i feel that the xiao long bao and noodles are outclassed by paradise dynasty,Negative
din-tai-fung,the food was great and there was no line at our local din tai fung in california it is impossible to get a reservation and the wait time is always more than one hour if you are lucky the xlb are scrumptious best xlb around we came her twice in our short stay of  days,Positive
din-tai-fung,really great dumplings and fried rice ill come back again for sure la location though,Positive
din-tai-fung,very good the dumplings were exceptional service was good and pretty quick considering the difficulty in making the kind of food we ordered which was every dumpling known to mankind next time i am trying the  year egg,Positive
din-tai-fung,real shame that i did not get a chance to take photos here they are opening up one at my local mall soon i found out about this place after driving home from marina bay i must say if i did not drive by then i would be missing out i must say this place is really awesome who knew three chinese words can make a difference this eatery meats the world standard of all restaurants in the world all the items that make the restaurant famous are here i really enjoyed the xiao long bao as well who knew i would find it at a better quality than any other dim sum place in the us and singapore this din tai fung is bigger than any other ones in the us cannot wait until they open up the one in valley fair mall only problem was that a dinner here is considered really expensive it is a good splurge,Positive
din-tai-fung,best soup dumplings ever we got the chili crab special which is well worth it and slightly different than the regular crab and pork that is on the menu the truffle soup dumpling is a nice treat the red bean dessert dumpling just becomes too much after a couple or maybe we just over ordered always a place that i scout out and go to in asia,Positive
din-tai-fung,while this is a chain and local in singapore it was my first time experiencing it and it did not disappoint located near tang plaza it was an easy walk from the marriott we were staying at the wait was not long and the view overlooked the main street of the high end shopping district,Negative
din-tai-fung,a famous taiwanese chain restaurant specializing in steamed dumplings which are made to order you can tell since they have an open window to the kitchen with a bunch of chefs rolling dough and stuffing dumplings behind them are stacks of bamboo dished sitting on top of a large steam generator we chose to go to this branch located in the wisma atria food republic for lunch during our last day in singapore before returning home overall great food and decent service the xiao long bao were probably our favorite basically these are small pork dumplings that are filled with a little bit of hot broth as in temperature hot you dip them in vinegar and eat them with extreme caution i usually put an entire one in my mouth and carefully chew off the edge which causes some of the broth the seep out i then proceed to eat the rest of the juicy dumpling the temperature was just right hot but not scalding bite into one of these things too quickly and you can run the risk of burning the inside of your mouth with a jet of hot soup no wonder they are translated to little dragon buns the spicy pork dumplings in red chili oil is another taiwanese classic and they make it good here as well very smooth dumpling skins with the right amout of spice the braided beef noodles is good enough to share with two people very tender and juicy brisket and chewy noodles for dessert we had three little black sesame buns the outside was white and smooth but the insiders were filled with lots of black sesame paste that was sweet and offered a grainy texture to contrast with the outer bun very tasty and a good way to end the email being a famous chain restuarant prices are generally higher than what you can get at the stalls in the food republic still this is a good place to go to if you are craving dumplings and want a quieter meal with your own table the various other menu offerings noodle stoups sauteed veggies traditional chinese dishes are also good if dumplings are not your thing,Positive
din-tai-fung,the crab xiao long bao has a funny taste i actually prefer the pork one much better the wonton in chili sauce was just ok that same dish was so much better when i had it in california food was just ok,Negative
din-tai-fung,i am obsessed with dumplings completely and utterly obsessed to me a great soup dumpling is the ultimate perfection we ordered pork soup dumplings shumai stir fried spinach pork noodles and chili wontons overall the food and ambiance were nice but the soup dumplings did not totally do it for me they were a bit small and the soup was not as flavorful as those i would eaten elsewhere the noodles were also a bit disappointing in the flavor department,Negative
din-tai-fung,i am going to have to jump on the bandwagon and agree that this din tai fung gets five stars my friend asked to meet at this one because it is the nicer one in singapore i can see why it is nicely located in the ritzy orchard district located on the lower level of the wisma atria shopping center we came for saturday dinner and it was packed but we only had to wait  minutes the people were pleasant and the service was great i did not know this before but they also provide little rolly baskets for people to put their personal items in next to their tables which is then covered by a blanket such a nice touch instead of having to hang your stuff behind your chair or putting it on the table the food at dtf is always on point and consistent of course we ordered the xiaolongbao is both salty and sweet version i personally am a fan of salty xiaolongbao is but the taro xiaolongbao is good for those with a sweet tooth hot and sour soup was very nice and i usually never order that basicaly you cannot go wrong with anything you order here so go nuts after your dinner feel free to walk around the huge shopping center and it is central to everything so you can really enjoy your day here dtf is a solid place to go,Positive
din-tai-fung,i came here for dinner with my aunt and sister after hearing so many great recommendations while visiting singapore the chili crab buns and dumplings were so flavorful and delicious it definitely met my expectations and we even ordered more dumplings after having finished our order ha din tai fung new favorite dumplings,Positive
din-tai-fung,probably one of my favorite restaurant with great confidence every branch of din tai fung in the world exhibits consistency in the quality quantity of food as can be found in their flagship store originated in taiwan this alone in terms of quality control impressed me it is not pricey at all for the consistency and quality of food delivered though there may be a tiny adjustments to local taste buds the dishes largely stay true to it is origin and how it was first delivered in taiwan however it is still quite an international flavor than to say it is a true taiwanese local flavor it is like eating in the actual taiwan branch but in singapore,Positive
din-tai-fung,decided to give the restaurant a go after reading reviews on yelp other sites we had a  minute wait in the que but received a list to record our order had to get my own menu we ordered hot sour soup the soup was okay not as flavorful as i was hoping edible after adding some vinager spice our favorites were the chili crab buns and dumplings the service was attentive and efficient the only complaint was jasmine tea was brought to the table without requesting it so we thought it was complimentary upon checking the bill we were charged   person not a huge deal but at least ask the customer if it is wanted other than that a very pleasant affordable meal,Negative
din-tai-fung,i always try the various dishes there everything is good but i would wish if they can improve the noodles i recommend the rice dishes than noodles,Positive
din-tai-fung,delicious food at dtf great dim sum small plates and of course fried rice the waiting line moves pretty quickly and the food comes out fast,Positive
din-tai-fung,came here in july  and had an absolutely awesome time eating their thin skinned plumply filled dumplings the special of the day was chili crab dumplings because we had a citibank credit card thank god for that plastic card would go back in a heartbeat except for the fact it would take  hours to get there,Positive
din-tai-fung,i never thought i would say this but i am all dtf would out i was so amazed by din tai fung the first time i tasted those delicious dumpling morsels at the mbs dtf and since then i have gone back so many times especially the one in jakarta at plaza indonesia when i practically lived at the grant hyatt jakarta on a project it is amazing how consistent dtfs are across the world we had to wait about  mins to be seated at this paragon basement dtf but again consistently good food and quick no nonsense service they have it down to a science,Positive
din-tai-fung,food was ok but what is very off putting is the extremely slow service was told that waiting time was  mins to be seated but out number was only called  mins later the food took another  minutes to arrive not professional,Negative
din-tai-fung,favourite dumplings anywhere whenever i am overseas i always crave these so much if you have not tried it you have to go the xlb skin is the perfect thickness with just the right amount of soup and meat while the normal one is still the best the truffle xlb is are worth trying as well as for the other stuff i absolutely love the fried rice here shrimp being my favourite and i have no idea how they get it to taste so good the la mian is alright but the ones at crystal jade paradise are better imo there is usually a queue at peak times but i find the paragon one moves the fastest out of the town dtfs though now that the wisma outlet expanded it is sometimes comparable,Positive
din-tai-fung,i love you dtf i have been eating here at various branches a long long time and it only gets better no brainer order get the xiao long bao the beef brisket noodle soup and the dou miao pea shoot greens with garlic end of story,Positive
din-tai-fung,very good food and efficient service i came here for the dimsum and was beyond satisfied great restaurant good baos and great dumplings must try if in singapore,Positive
din-tai-fung,when reading reviews i am the kind of person that just looks for food recommendations and skips everything else so let is get straight to it split between  people fully vegetarian options first steamed veg dumplings pcs x hong kong kailan with special sauce nao bai with garlic stewed bean curd cubes with honey saucemy favorite meat option that i have had thus far oriental wontons with black vinegar and chili oil if you are not a vegetarian please get this steamed pork dumplingscomes out to about   sgd per person and you eat like royalty i am dying to try the pork and truffle dumplings,Positive
din-tai-fung,my wife and i were in singapore for a combined business and pleasure trip and were staying nearby we decided to try the food court at wisma mall and found din tai fung we are both big fans of dim sum type dumplings so we decide to have lunch these were some of the best dumplings we have ever had in addition the spinach with garlic was excellent i know i will never be able to make the dumplings but i am trying my best to recreate the spinach back home in the usa we went back twice after the first visit and tried some other dishes but the dumplings outshine everything else service was top notch efficient and friendly too bad there is not a din tai fung in minneapolis minnesota we would be there every week,Positive
din-tai-fung,i generally do not like chinese food i know i know then why do i live here so i came here partially as a way to see if i could convince myself it could be good partially expecting to poke a hole in the hype with a low rating the xlb were disarmingly excellent and the pork and vegetable dumplings and chilicrab bun were also very good it was not too expensive except i wish the vegetables were cheaper the service was unusually good having had my tea cup refilled   times without having to ask even the air conditioning was at a reasonable level in other words all of the issues that i usually complain about with regards to singaporean restaurants mediocre food high prices neglectful waiters fake winter were conspicuously absent they won me over,Negative
din-tai-fung,first time eating real dumplings the crabmeat and pork is phenomenal also had the truffle and pork dumplings which were great also will definitely come back again,Positive
din-tai-fung,i have been dining at this location for over a year and though the food is consistently outstanding the service is seriously lacking many times they have forgotten items which i have ordered and by the time i am able to flag the wait staff down which can be nearly impossible it has been  minutes and they bring it out with the dessert simply put they need to do a better job making sure patrons are all taken care of and that their orders are fulfilled oh and would it kill them to smile orchard road is a convenient location and that is the only reason i return do yourself a favor and go to raffles city location they actually have it together,Positive
din-tai-fung,it is my personal belief that dtf across singapore comes with different service levels and quality of food levels although its a chain restaurant i seem to find that some places which shall not be named are lacking compared to others in my honest opinion the dtf at wisma atria is one of the best i have had in terms of both service and food i do not think i need to wax lyrical about their dishes because everyone else here will probably be better able to recommend you what to eat but if you are going on a budget of around  bucks for  people here is the combo i would recommend and in fact its what i have every single time i go to dtf  xiao cai for starters xiao long bao for sharing fried rice beef brisket souptah dah fills you up in no time,Positive
din-tai-fung,i think it is just a kind of chinese fastfood,Negative
din-tai-fung,although a chain din tai fung bang them out with the best of them cute atmosphere with a great selection of team and an even better selection of buns get the shao lum bao soup dumplings with pork and crab chive and pork were also nice if you require a little greens in you life try the pea spouts sauted in garlic,Positive
din-tai-fung,i adore dtf thanks to my time in singapore i discovered this delicious chain that i just cannot get enough of ah the good old days when i would huddle up with a book two trays of xlb and a large hot sour soup all to myself it took me about an hour to eat it all but i always finished it is that good nobody makes xiao long bao as delicately as they do it is practically an art form i also love their hot sour soup which has fantastically thinly sliced veggies i hate when i get huge chunks that steal the show and prefer when all the flavors blend as they do with this dish i have tried a bunch of their other dumplings all of which were good in their own right but i cannot come here without ordering at least one tray of xlb you have got to too this place is wildly popular and there is almost always a line so be prepared for a slight wait usually  mins but sometimes longer depending on your party size time of day day of week it is my favorite location because of the openness you feel with the glass walls and the efficiency of the service just because it is crazy busy and hectic does not mean that you wo not get timely service,Positive
din-tai-fung,the xiao long bao is very good juicy and succulent the skin is thin and perfect texture it is also always fun to see them making the dumplings service is generally good and the selection is wide only downside is the long wait,Positive
din-tai-fung,always consistently good it is one of the favourite places that i go to when i visit singapore i love their xiao long pao especially the one with truffle pork chop noodles or fried rice service is always good and consistent as well,Positive
din-tai-fung,my parents and i stumbled upon din tai fung after a long day of walking and window shopping we were really hungry and decided to try out this restaurant i have came across din tai fung many times when shopping at level  however my mom and i never tried the restaurant because the waiting queue is usually really long it was not until my dad said that din tai fung is a really good restaurant from taiwan and encouraged us to try it that we finally had dinner there the food is delicious you have to try the xiao long bao juicy pork dumplings there or you will be missing out it is the juiciest most delicious dumplings i have ever had what special about xiao long bao is that there is a little bit of soup inside the dumplings dip the dumpling inside soy sauce and vinegar add a little bit of the ginger yes you will be missing out too if you do not eat it with ginger and it will simply melt in your mouth we ordered several other dishes such as pork shop fried rice shaomai bean sauced noodle drunken chicken and tofu appetizer they are all delicious i also love the refreshing dried longan drink i was looking for it at din tai fung in arcadia california but unfortunately they do not have it there since then whenever we visit singapore we always come to din tai fung the food is definitely worth the long wait besides there are a few shops around that you could go to while waiting for your number to be called the kitchen is also see through if you want to see how the dumplings are made personally i prefer this din tai fung more than the ones in california because there are more choices available especially the longan drink although my favorite din tai fung has to be the one in taiwan,Positive
din-tai-fung,i can not say anything bad about this restaurant i just wish it was open  hours i miss this place very much because i am away in dc my mom always tell me she going to mail me this food but she never do my favorite thing here is the shao lum bao and the soup and pork dumplings oh my gosh my mouth watering right now,Positive
din-tai-fung,during my week long vacay here i must have eaten at a din tai fung at least  times i heart xiao long bao the restaurant is clean service is speedy and friendly and the food is great there is a variety of things to eat other than soup dumplings i love the noodles with spicy sauce i devoured a entire bowl and forgot to share with my  other diners oops it is also pretty neat that you can watch them creating dumplings in the kitchen through big glass windows i wish they had this chain in dallas,Positive
din-tai-fung,very good taiwan based chain dumpling place reliable and tasty food good service sadly this chain has become omnipresent so the uniqueness factor is gone still a good choice for your dumpling craving,Positive
din-tai-fung,this was where it happened my very first xiao long bao as legends go all xiao long bao henceforth known as xlb virgins pay the price their first time scalding your tongue on the soup hidden within it is delicate skin i was torn between letting it happen or scheming up an escape but then i thought why spoil the moment so i caved and let the xlb do to me what it was meant to i bit into the plump dumpling and was i was warned about the hot soup but gladly got scalded any how and the flavour i have not had any better and after visiting even the other branches of this store i do not think i will maybe the hands here are magic after all being caught up in the fantasy world that is xlb it is hard to look around you and notice anything else but of course when you come up for air everything is as it should be the wait staff are mega speedy and relatively polite they say hi when they stop by to drop off each dish they top up your tea often and it just seems like a well oiled machine before you think xlb is everything that they serve but it should be there is a sizeable menu of things that include a super tasty pork chop fried rice and a mystery mix of veggies called xiao cai do not think just order i now employ a break skin and slurp up soup policy but you never forget your first time eh,Negative
din-tai-fung,all time favorite restaurant in sg moderately priced and crazily delicious perfect for expats locals and tourists who grave a delicious little taste of the far east,Positive
din-tai-fung,the best dumplings i have ever eaten perfectly textured dough perfect amount of moisture perfect size perfect temperature and flavor that makes your jaw want to drop but it cannot or soup will spill out the black truffle special is one of the most delectable bites of food i have experienced we came twice during our stay and i have been trying to get to the one n l a ever since will definitely be back next time i am in singapore,Positive
din-tai-fung,was recommended by a co worker it was  of us and we ordered hungrier than we actually were the dumplings were awesome so juicy and so much favor i got the pork egg fried rice as my entre it was d lish did my best to clean my plate highly recommend,Positive
din-tai-fung,food was good but i thought it was better at their kuala lampur location the line was long and we waited about  minutes i thought i was getting hyppglycemic so we picked up a piece of duck at another place they would not let us finish it without an argument once we were seated i hear the wait in irvine ca can be  hours so i should not complain about  minutes,Negative
din-tai-fung,i would say there food is okish not super impressed with xiao long bao we waited for a long time to get our food but they do a good job giving us extra ginger,Positive
din-tai-fung,the problem with ding tai fung is not that it is terrible ask anyone that does not know better and they will tell you it is good food the meals are hot and arrive relatively quickly and they look well presented but the problem with dtf in singapore is they do not have a strong sense of the kind of flavors expected of steamed soup dumplings and even the red roast beef noodles are merely ok in flavor it needs a lot more of that oomph and rarely delivers,Negative
din-tai-fung,i tried the fried rice dish here and it is the best fried rice that i have ever tried before the fried rice is very fragrant and the colour is golden colour as for the other dishes i have ordered i also recommend the xiao long bao which is very juicy and satisfactory,Positive
din-tai-fung,my favourite place for xiaolongbao no other place can beat it even in shanghai all other dishes are also delicious good ambiance and very professional and well trained service staff every dinning experience is memorable,Positive
din-tai-fung,beyond delicious shanghai soup dumplings premium quality ingredients very fresh restaurant was so clean i could have eaten off the floor service was good as well,Positive
din-tai-fung,aside from the service which varies with every visit it is worth it when my dinner comes amazing,Positive
din-tai-fung,great food good prices we ordered the crab and pork dumplings and they were fantastic,Positive
din-tai-fung,i do not have much to say about din tai fung except that it is delicious and that i recommend you give it a try the very first time i came here was with a friend and i ordered the beef noodles and of course the xiao long bao both of which were great since then i have gone to different branches of the restaurant including one of the ones in taipei as well and am happy to say that the quality is consistent throughout a friend in la tells me that the din tai fung there is the same as the one she tried in taipei though the american menu has a few different options,Positive
din-tai-fung,top  restaurant in the world at under  person sign me up tried the dumplings and fried rice both were spot on will be back,Positive
din-tai-fung,amazing little place voted one the worlds top  restaurants the dumplings are incredible you can watch them being handmade in the front window,Positive
din-tai-fung,best dumplings ever my  year old even ate  of them we were at paragon had already eaten lunch but decided since i was visiting i must try the world famous food it was pm on a tuesday and there was no line we had  dumplings a tiger beer and tea perfect snack craving them now that i am back in the us,Positive
din-tai-fung,i have been to two of their location one in singapore and one in taiwan yes their dumplings are good the place gets crowded quickly people lining out on the street,Positive
din-tai-fung,i had a bowl of noodles with preserved veg and minced pork tasty but the noodles werent as chewy as i expected,Negative
din-tai-fung,i reckon its the consistently good and most mouth watering dim sums in the world love the stir fry spinach spicy sauce noodles,Positive
din-tai-fung,very good dumplings loved the pork pork crab were good the chicken we did not enjoy as much mainly because the green onion dominated the flavor the veggies were awesome,Positive
din-tai-fung,love all the savory options here spicy tofu watercress dates w rice veggie dumplings all tiny portions but very filling,Positive
din-tai-fung,bomb that is all i can say got the crab and pork could totally taste the crab also got shrimp and pork was more regular dumpling shape but good none the less,Positive
din-tai-fung,i know i know it is a chain restaurant but it is so addictive i have been to different restaurants in different malls but they all manage to keep the flavor constant it is no mean feat the best thing on the menu is the seaweed glass noodle salad appetizer it is light it is tasty and packed with so much flavor the xiao long bao is really yummy there too the texture is not too thick or thin and none of them are broken when they are served food snobs may scoff at the chain restaurant concept but trust me this one is worth checking out,Positive
din-tai-fung,this is dumpling heaven i ate here a couple times when i was living in singapore and i have also eaten at the one in taipei this was probably one of my favorite meals while living in asia and i have not been able to find dumplings that good anywhere else my friend and i probably ordered  or  different types of dumplings and there was not a single one that i did not like the xiao long bao was the best i have ever had the taro dumplings for dessert were addictive i never really found another version that even came close to being as good,Positive
din-tai-fung,great for solid xlbs a chain restaurant that has invaded the us as well,Positive
din-tai-fung,i love din tai fung im always guaranteed a great meal when i come here service is always good and prompt be prepared to wait a bit during weekends and dinner time the dumplings are definitely a must try here as are their appetizers i really love the honeyed tofu with peanuts its so good their shrimp fried rice and stir fried veggies are also really good its no wonder that this place is so popular all around the world ive been so many times and have ever been disappointed great place,Positive
din-tai-fung,a very average restaurant chain tried many times to convince myself that it is as good the reviews and advertisment out there but the answer is still no the many restaurants in china i have been to thou not as famous as dtf but ten times better,Negative
cloud-forest,loved the cloud forest dome it is huge and amazing i have never seen so much tropical plants and orchids before in one place i really enjoyed myself here and you can tell from my pictures i do have to note this place was super cold inside the dome with the big waterfall inside made it worse it was full on ac and i thought tropical plants needed warmth this is not for folks with a fear of heights too the pathways on top were pretty high up there great for picture taking this was well worth our advance purchase and to avoid the long lines at the ticket counter it was a little cheaper as well totally recommend while touring singapore,Positive
cloud-forest,this is a absolute favorite if you made the trek to the gardens by the bay put up some cash for a trip to this enchanted forest and garden up in the clouds the tiered levels as you ascend makes it feel and smell like you are in the clouds if can get a bit misty and foggy in parts as you make your way up there is every mix and color of orchids you could think up so many unusual blends of gorgeous and wild flowers everywhere it is a result of the beauty nature can yield if left to their own devices,Positive
cloud-forest,it was slightly cheaper to buy the cloud forest with the flower dome experience together than to buy them separately so that is what i did if greenhouses are ur thing then this is the mother lode of all greenhouses that must be witnessed live it was super cool to see this alive and robust tropical paradise in all its colorful glory i did not want to see another plant after this experience which should tell u that this forest will satisfy all of ur tree hugging needs for many years to come,Negative
cloud-forest,the cloud forest is one of the attractions at the gardens and is inside one of the large domes i do not know exactly why it is called the cloud forest the dome may be as high as the clouds outside or there may actually be some clouds inside from the waterfall and rain they have created there it may be cheating that i post pictures from inside the dome since you have to pay to go inside but if you do not get a chance to go to singapore and see this you should have a chance to see what you are missing after all the photos i am posting i think you will want to make the trip,Negative
cloud-forest,we stayed at the marina bay sands so it was a no brainer to stop by the cloud forest because it was within walking distance and came with good recommendations from local friends upon arrival we were met with a cool breeze and spray from an indoor waterfall a cool that you wo not find often in singapore that alone was the worth the price of admission we were so impressed by the variety of tropical plants the orchids and the setting of each area the skill of the conservation is amazing and is extraordinary there are around seven levels to explore with different themes or focus i felt like i was in an unreal bubble looking out towards the real world which also seemed unreal because the whole city of singapore is an architectural marvel i would really recommend visiting the cloud forest and also leaving extra time for the flower dome because we regretted missing it,Positive
cloud-forest,first time coming here and i was completely blown away came in early on a week day to beat the crowd it was amazing being in here absolutely beautiful it is nice and chill thanks to the ac so it works as a great escape from the heat walking around you will notice dragon statues hidden throughout the place take the elevator up to the skywalk for better views including a cool view of the marina bay sands as you walk through the different levels they have displays and presentations about global warming and climate change i highly recommend coming here i left this place blown away at it is beauty and wanting to plant some trees,Positive
cloud-forest,if you come to singapore this is a must see usually botanical gardens would not top my list but this took my breath away honestly it is like walking through a scene from the movie avatar perfectly maintained you will state in amazement and wonder to yourself how they can possible keep up with the sheer variety and amount of plants sprinkle in some amazing art work that ties in perfectly to its surroundings you might as well be walking through a fairy tale also some of the best views of the skyline really just gorgeous,Positive
cloud-forest,by far one of the most beautiful places i have ever seen i could not recommend it more to visitors it is a little pricey but completely worth it they also have a cloud pathway in which you take an elevator to the very top and then walk down a pathway that circles around the mountain of plants and flowers it is absolutely stunning i would recommend not going after  pm it gets extremely busy and the line to go in was very long initially we bought our tickets online but there was a mixup and had to repurchase them there so i would recommend just buying it there,Positive
cloud-forest,out of all the features of gardens by the bay the cloud forest has to be my absolute favorite destinations the cloud forest is an immersive and lush experience that is sure to take your breath away right when you walk in you are greeted by a massive hill of green that houses more plants exhibits and a sky walkway highlights of this whole exhibit for me would have to include the orchid garden and the sky walkway the orchid garden is small but carefully curated all hybrids chosen to be displayed are beautiful and have different aromas do not be afraid to stop and smell all of them additionally the sky walkway is a seemingly expansive trail above the cloud forest that gives you various views around the whole building there is various stops on the sky walkway that will give you informational exhibits about plants landforms and so much more overall a magical way to spend your day,Positive
cloud-forest,buying a ticket to cloud forest feels like buying a ticket to the year  right from your first step into the wonderfully air conditioned greenhouse you are instantly greeted by a larger than life waterfall ripped straight out of a scene from avatar plant people architecture afficionados and those on the quest to become stay insta famous will all find a slice of heaven in this modern marvel the variety of plant species and flowers on display are almost overwhelmingly plentiful the walkways and supporting structures throughout this mega greenhouse are truly well designed and rival those of science fiction finally there are several platforms to take in views and living walls that make for picturesque backdrops all enough to make any instagram addict foam at the mouth singapore is cloud garden is a wonderful place to feel inspired and truly awe struck enjoy your stroll through the greenhouse of the future,Positive
cloud-forest,it is magic you have to go if you are in sg if you have only enough time to do either the flower dome or the cloud forest do the cloud forest i cannot describe in words how amazing this place is you walk around the bottom floor and then go up around this central rainforest mountain probably the best part about sg,Positive
cloud-forest,the cloud forest is a must see when visiting singapore the gardens are exceptionally well kept and breath taking it was not super crowded but it was busy when we were inside leave yourself plenty of time to admire everything from the driftwood sculptures to the microscopic orchids cloud forest is sure to please any nature lover,Positive
cloud-forest,wow this is hands down the best greenhouse i have ever been to in my life you walk into a cooled building and are greeted with a pretty waterfall surrounded by lush greenery and vivid flowers this is enough to make the ticket price worth it as it is a nice reprieve from the heat outside you go through the many levels of plants and see rare flowers that you probably would never see in your lifetime there are also cool native artworks from southeast asia interspersed throughout the foliage the best part for me was the surprising ending where they give you information about climate change i think the way they did it was very well thought out and not preachy which i believe helps people want to stop and listen if you are in gardens by the bay this is a must stop sight,Positive
cloud-forest,this was a good experience loved the indoor waterfall especially that it is always on the top things to do in singapore although other than the waterfall and experiencing walking down the different flights from bridges there was not much to the place there were great views of the outside through the large glass windows there is a two for one ticket for the cloud forest and the flower garden dome,Positive
cloud-forest,the better of the two i came for the rainfall it did not disappoint the best view is at the entrance and looking up at the rain fall the rest of the cloud forest is exploring plants that grow in a forest condition quite impressed with the design and creativity that thought to have a water fall in a greenhouse the other best feeling is the air conditioning a great way to spend  hours away from the hot weather,Positive
cloud-forest,cloud forest is an amazing and unique experience i am usually bored by botanical gardens and conservatories but this one was special it really feels like jurassic park loved the waterfall the elevated walkways really the entire experience if you visit one place in singapore make it cloud forest,Positive
cloud-forest,imagine a large indoor rainforest with a towering waterfall tons of flowers and greenery and a cave with stalagmites stalactites reminds me of my school days i think they had an episode on the magic school bus show about this as well so much to see it was just beautiful and at times quite tranquil to walk around this forest it was a visual and sensory experience the best thing about it was the air conditioning provided in this indoor greenhouse forest this was much appreciated what when the consistent temperature in singapore was usually more than  degrees f this is a must do on your list if you come to singapore the ticket for cloud forest also includes access to their other exhibit the flower dome so that was cool they also have mist shows here at different times of the day so cloud forest looks even more mysterious and magical i am really glad we got to check this out,Positive
cloud-forest,what a work of architectural nature artistic elegance this is worth the  sgd or so entrance fee and i opted to pay for entrance to the flower dome as well so best in a bundle this dome is beautiful and is perfect for a cool off break from the hot humid singapore weather you feel it first as you walk in and observe the fresh huge indoor waterfall it is cooling plus there is air conditioning so if you need i would recommend bringing a light jacket or shawl the temperature is at least under  degrees celsius i would say as you hike up and around the center hill waterfall you are able to see the various types of plants and species that you would find high up in the canopy of the world is tallest trees it was really unique and the layout kept you in awe the whole time there is also a portion which highlights the stalactites and stalagmites which can be found in some caves as well this is a definite highlight for travelers near and far really unique and i cannot say if there is anything in the world like this,Positive
cloud-forest,if you can visit one dome in the gardens by the bay make it this one while the flower dome is awesome this one is more spectacular with the vertical waterfall and high arch skywalks upon walking in you can immediately feel the cool relief from the blistering humidity you will follow the path that eventually winds up to the top of the dome where you will be rewarded with a grand view walking back down along the windy skywalks is breathtaking it is pretty much a surreal experience and not to be missed,Positive
cloud-forest,so pretty and an amazing experience better than the flower dome i have heard from multiple people  dome is   domes is  it is cheaper if you are a local resident the dome is majestic with beautiful greenery contained within at the end there is also great info on how they power gardens by the bay with sustainable energy and a video on climate change encouraging you to be more environmentally friendly i went around sunset which is best you get to see it in the day as you enter and as you slowly descend the dome the sun sets and at the end it was nightfall and i got to see the dome at night too great experience for tourists and if you are local and have never been check it out,Positive
cloud-forest,magnificent creation so glad i chose to go here instead of the flower dome i was being a cheapo and did not want to spend  on two conservatories so i just bought a ticket for one conservatory the cloud forest had lots of plants and trees that did not interest me at all but the waterfall and the walkways were mind blowing once i pulled open that heavy door to the conservatory a coolness draped over me the temperature made everything so much more realistic the waterfall was right by the door and i could not believe that i was staring at world is tallest indoor waterfall needless to say it was a mesmerizing sight there were a lot of tourists taking pictures in front of it but with a distance i was wondering why so i went as near to it as i could for my picture and it was then that i understood why the water splashes and it literally felt like i was taking a shower under it call me crazy but i actually really enjoyed that lol the cloud walk and treetop walk were basically bridges that went semi around the conservatory it felt like a death defying experience for me because i could have had a heart attack i tried my best to walk right in the middle cause the sides did not feel as sturdy but a lot of people were stopping to take pics and whatnot there was even a little balcony on one floor i do not understand why but the balcony had holes on the floor like why anyway it was a surreal experience with great views this is a must for if you go to singapore,Negative
cloud-forest,better than the flower dome as soon as you walk in you have this massive garden waterfall which is phenomenal this has a lot more levels than the flower dome and a lot of information about singapore as a city the further into the dome you get really interesting and beautiful place,Positive
cloud-forest,if you had to choose between cloud forest or flower dome cloud forest definitely wins as soon as you walk in you are greeted with a giant indoor waterfall the temperature inside the dome is a nice change from the hot humidity outside the mist and waterfall keep things cool as you stroll through the exhibit you start at a lower elevation and work your way up to the top before going back down the plants the greenery the floral all breathtaking buy your tickets online for discounted rates and go into the redemption line to pick up not the purchase tickets line it also saves you time since redeeming is a lot quicker and the lines are shorter,Positive
cloud-forest,unbelieveablly beautiful it is surreal to see them mist as well since the top looks like a space ship the flora and fauna are super diverse and was amazing to see it grow along the wall a must visit if you are in singapore,Positive
cloud-forest,was beautiful and amazing as you would guess great photos can be taken in here definitely recommend for photography,Positive
cloud-forest,the could forest was awesome it had a huge waterfall inside and was just stunning this is a must see in singapore there is a cloud walk that goes about six stories high which is beautiful it is well worth the money just make sure you take photos before the misting happens otherwise your photos will be a bit foggy definitely a great stop,Positive
cloud-forest,beautiful part of the gardens by the bay the extra prices is well worth it you could spend a long time roaming around inside it is kept air conditioned too this showcases the lush plant life that comes from singapore,Positive
cloud-forest,wow go to the other dome first if you do this vice versa it wo not be as cool or dramatic of a change it is a cool built rainforest it would be amazing to do a behind the scenes tour,Negative
cloud-forest,family friendly if you plan on checking out garden by the bay is light show cloud forest is a nice place to visit and kill time while it is hot out tickets can be purchased by the booth on the day of visit the flower dome was nice but i was more entertained in the cloud forest,Positive
cloud-forest,in the end it is a botanic garden but way bigger and more impressive than everything i have seen up to now there is a huge hollow mountain in the middle of the dome from which water is falling down and you can feel the spray on a hot day this is definitely a cool down you can take the stairs or if you are not too much into walking the elevator to reach the top and then walk down the trail in our case it was a little bit too crowded kills the experience a little never the less you can see a lot nature some great wooden carvings and in the end you learn a little about global warming it is not annoying but can cause remorse when you are not treating mother earth as she deserves it comparing both domes flower and this i would choose this over the other both are great architectural buildings but this one has the more interesting content,Positive
cloud-forest,wow that is the first word that comes to mind as you enter the cloud forest at the gardens by the bay your breath is taken away as you look up at the world is tallest indoor waterfall and think to yourself where the hell am i am i in pandora did i become an avatar no i am still human and in a cooled greenhouse on the singapore waterfront none of this should make sense but it does and it is an experience not to be missed the cloud forest is a really unique experience featuring the upper level vegetation and climates without climbing up    feet the elevator ride up to the top and the gentle walk down the pathways to the ground level feature a pretty mesmerizing experience of flora and fauna all surrounding this gentle mist of the waterfall it is not really much of a hike but i suppose you could say you did it if you need the exercise points while it may seem like a touristy thing to do it is far from it ok maybe it is but it is a pretty spectacular sight to see,Negative
cloud-forest,cloud forest at gardens by the bay i would say it is a must see when in singapore when you first walk in you are greeted by the waterfall which is absolutely breathtaking i enjoyed strolling around and looking at all the different things they had in there all the flowers and woodworks carvings they had some flowers and other things made out of all legos which i thought were pretty cool just amazing a great way to spend an hour or so take in the beautiful work they have put into this place,Positive
cloud-forest,a great place to beat the heat and enjoy the view you can get great pictures from the top of and you work your way down exploring there is a video at the end you can watch that explains global warming and how it will affect us in the future honestly i enjoyed the botanical garden more than the cloud forest but i would recommend seeing both,Positive
cloud-forest,the most important detail air conditioned or at least cool if not also pretty moist humid but certainly refreshing after the outside but for that exact reason it was a mob scene on a random tuesday night the standard people taking selfies and blocking the path and basically just being ignorant of everyone else around them which drives me nuts that aside this is a pretty cool display really cool structure with some great views of things both inside an out i particularly loved the top floor display of carniverous plants pitcher plants venus fly traps etc mixed with lego versions of the same not sure if this is permanent or not but it was cool also i know this is not a botanical garden singapore has one of those and it is not gardens by the bay but i do think they could do a better job presenting information on what you are seeing information is kind of sparse and i would have spent more time here and enjoyed it more had there been more information on what i was seeing more stuff about the ecosystem being represented and so on that omission is what keeps me from raving about this of the two cloud forest and flower dome i would say this is the one that is more worth visiting it is more interesting to me although maybe without the variety of flower dome but frankly both are pretty reasonable to get in to so i would not turn people away from either,Negative
cloud-forest,this is one of the domes in the botanical gardens and definitely worth the visit you can get a combined ticket for both this and the flower dome about  us or you can buy individual tickets we did not have a lot of time so we chose to visit only the cloud dome and i am so glad we at least made time for this one the waterfall that cascades down from the misty heights is  m tall and the world is tallest indoor waterfall when you first walk in the dome the towering misty mountain transport you into another world the lush vegetation is stunning and i love how they have added structures and statues to make it look like a forgotten world there are several stories to go up so that you can see the dome at different heights there is a really pretty lilly pond at the top and a lot of fun interactive learning features to check out as you make your way back down to the bottom great place for a family trip and very reasonably priced,Positive
cloud-forest,tons of photo opportunities and an amazing way to show the beauty of nature recommend going during a misting if you are a photographer,Positive
cloud-forest,amazing located in the gardens by the bay the highlight is the cloud forest not to be missed it houses the largest indoor waterfall multi story indoor cloud forest with great flowers,Positive
cloud-forest,expensive but worth it it was absolutely breath taking the views are incredible i wish i would had more time or had taken the guided to tour to really be able to appreciate all of the different plants on display if i am able to make it back to sin i will spring the extra for the tour thoroughly enjoyed it,Positive
cloud-forest,i did not get to check this place out the last time i was in singapore so i made it a priority to come here this time and i must admit that it was well worth the visit basically it is an indoor eco system with an artificial mountain that is coverved with tropical trees you can go to the top of the mountain where there are walkways that wind their way down and they even spray mist to give the impression of a well a cloud forest the basement level consists namely of ecological information pertaining to climate change and also how they keep this place running through the use of resusable energy and recycled water oh and the first thing you encounter when you step through the doors is what is basically an awesome waterfall definately something to check out in singapore though i would highly recommend going to the gardens by the bay in any event,Positive
cloud-forest,we were so intrigued to see the world is tallest indoor waterfall while we were at gardens by the bay so we purchased a ticket to see it we were not disappointed at all by what we saw and it was very magical to experience the humidity of rain forest inside a dome we walked closer to the waterfall as soon as we saw it and felt the mist on our skin i think families with kids will definitely enjoy this attraction and the green lush vegetation was very easy to the eyes the size of the green mountain was  metre high and we enjoyed every step to the mountain top while learning about the biodiversity and plants from tropical highlands,Positive
cloud-forest,a must see attraction for the family impressively tall indoor mountain forest exhibit refreshingly cool air to get away from the heat outside we paid for the tram out of the subway so we would not have to walk in the humid heat glad we did also got a combined ticket for the adjacent flower dome which had a lovely cherry blossom exhibit,Negative
cloud-forest,been there done that  steps interesting plants great landscape a ton of instagram worthy pics,Positive
cloud-forest,who knew that there would be an amazing unesco world heritage site here in singapore this is a beautiful garden and definitely one of a kind i would recommend that you stop by the first teller than you see when you get out of the subway and into the park where you can purchase a  set ticket for the botanical garden cloud forest and golf cart transfer i did not think i would need it but it was worth it note that once you start making your way down and head to the st floor there is no way back to where you originally started the path takes you down to the gift store so be sure to take your time and take pictures along the way i did not thinking that we would be back where we started and completely regretted it,Positive
cloud-forest,beautiful breathtaking out of this world cool just some of the ways i would describe my time at the cloud forest i went early in the morning to avoid the crowds and i would suggest doing that for those of you that suffer from the jet lag early in the trip to go and take a walk around here in the am it is unlike anything i have ever seen,Positive
cloud-forest,i really enjoyed the cloud forest very educational as well as visually impressive the walkways give you phenomenal points of view what i also liked was the explanation as to how the whole complex was built with sustainability in mind and practically generates all its own power worth a visit for sure,Positive
cloud-forest,i prefer cloud forest to the flower dome get there in the am so that you could enjoy the walk from the mrt station,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,thanks yelp for directing me to this restaurant as my very first meal in singapore ever i was not convinced that this place warranted the reviews when i saw a couple patsy white ribs in some clear ish broth how could anything be delicious when it looked boiled with no seasonings nope nope nope i stand corrected i can admit i was very wrong the meat was unlike any other ribs i have ever had and the broth is just an extra bonus how something so unassuming and simple can be so good i can not pretend to even know but my socks were completely knocked off can soup make a grown woman cry yes yes it can the ambiance and service is simple the price is low and the product is amazing will i fly back to singapore for ribs in soup i just might,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,best bak kut teh pork rib soup in singapore too many good food in singapore and it is hard to say which one is the best however if you ask for bak kut teh recommendation i gotta say songfamedan is the best among all i am so impressed by the tenderness of the pork ribs which they even show you the level of tenderness of each pork rib soup on their menu no wonder they are listed under the michelin bib gourmand pro tip do not worry about you will finish the soup quickly as they have unlimited refills,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,best food i have had in singapore the service was fast and food came out almost immediately but the bak kut teh is to die for this is a traditional singaporean dish that consists of braised pork ribs with tea broth the broth is rich with a rich garlic flavor the meat practically falls off the bone a large portion is around  singaporean dollars   us dollars plenty of seating but it can get cramped since there is so many customers however i miss their food a ton and would for sure come back if i ever am in singapore again,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,get a portable and foldable silicone cup to protect the health siliconeuse com product,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,currently back in the states and i am regretting not bringing back song fa is bak kut teh spice packets fair warning the soup is verrrry peppery i personally enjoy the kick but i can see how it can be too much for some other than that the broth is sooo warming i enjoyed it in  degree heat so i cannot imagine how good it is when it is cold does it even get cold in singapore the pork rib is tender and meaty i loved biting it off the bone best part is that the soup is unlimited once they see that you are running low a server comes to refill your bowl do not be discouraged if you see a line outside as it moves super quickly,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i get the hype it is one of the most consistent places in terms of both food quality and service even though the food is fairly simple i find myself coming here pretty much once a week on the weekends to get my fix the broth is definitely the highlight for me it is peppery but there is no sharp heat it is so comforting that i usually get at least   refills the meat is pretty tender but the broth is really the star i personally get the large size because i do not get rice or noodle but i think most people will be fine withe regular size the other items are pretty decent as well but i always stick to the bak kut teh as the primary focus the only down side is the line queue they do make the wait time more productive by taking order first,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this soup was not bad just not my favorite it is a peppery porky broth but the soup and pork ribs were little bland by my standards it is nice that they refill the broth though i did not really get the hype around this but maybe i am just not used to singaporean cuisine get the lemon iced tea really refreshing,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i would come here and just get the pork soup we got the normal one large  pieces vs  pieces for rib you get unlimited broth so we just got one large bowl with about  refills omg so good so peppery keep in mind i have not been to other ones but i loved how homey and cheap it was the other items we got were pork trotters chicken feet lightly fried chicken rolls none of those really stuck out tbh i would stick to just the soup they were not bad by any means just nothing could match the soup some soup a little bit of rice and i think you are set we also got the soursop drink and i really thought the fruit worked well,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,damn this place is the place to come for dinner we had veggies beancurd skin pork belly premium loin ribs soup and rice the premium loin ribs soup was very very tasty the soup was very well made and with lots of punch the flavor was on the spot i addition the ribs were very tasty up to the bone the punch of the night was the pork belly it had the proper combination of fat and skinny meat the sauce made the dish even more tastier i gotta warn that this place gets pretty crowded and the wait line can take up to hr or more so be prepared for such long line and long wait time,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,so so simple but so so good and love that it opens at  am so my friends and i could get a breakfast in ordered the pork rib soup which is what they are known for especially if it is in the name of the restaurant and they constantly refill the soup which is nice it tastes heavily of white pepper but i love it and the pork is so tender it falls off the bone definitely one of those restoring and revitalizing feeling soups also got the braised pork belly which was good but if you are sticking to a smaller breakfast just go for the bak kut teh would definitely come back for another,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,go a little late to avoid long lines during meal hours they have the best bak kut teh pork rib soup ever their broth is amazing and they come and refill your bowl if you are low they also have other good vegetable and meat dishes but their pork rib soup is the best they charge for green tea and refill it only once for free super delicious clean and air conditioning,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,oh my oh my do not judge a book by its cover their pork rib soup may look simple but i like to think it has magical powers the peppery and warm broth hits your throat like no other it really warms up your body and makes you feel so good the soup is sweet and peppery but never too overpowering not to mention the pork ribs are so damn tender so easy to bite off and does not have a weird meaty taste just so damn perfect i think this dish is pretty healthy i had a sore throat the day i tried this dish and it completely healed itself the next day what a magical soup this is,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,one of the best bkt restaurants around song fa is famous and old though i do not think they would be the original as there are variations of who made the first bkts hokkien style or the more herbal version i would definitely recommend getting the pickled mustard greens to pair with the savory ness of bkt also they come around and refill the broth which is the best part,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,very cozy feeling when you walk into the store definitely recommend trying their items on the menu with the stars i got the traditional pork bak kuh teh and i absolutely loved it i am usually not the type to order soup when i go out to eat because i am scared it wo not be flavorable however song fa definitely is a michelin star worthy restaurant it was so delicious that we bought their packed soup base to bring back home to make,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,the soup here was delicious and the staff is friendly and helpful as well i ordered the ba ku teh which at about  comes with  pork bones and soup but as you are eating the bones and the soup they come around and refill your bowl with more soup the big benefit of that is that the soup always tastes super hot because there is only so much soup at any given time and every time you get more the soup pipping hot which keeps the experience super enjoyable the broth has a rich tasty pork taste with a bit of pepper in it it was a hearty warm loving soup and i personally liked the amount of pepper i thought it balanced the soup really well the cai lan was also pretty good as well as the lemon tea overall a super enjoyable experience and one of my favorite meals in singapore,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,went to singapore to visit a friend and this place was recommended to me this place has a couple locations around sg but i was advised to go to this one i ordered the one and only bak kut teh for breakfast the pork ribs were soft and fall off the bone the broth soup is pepper but light they also refill your broth soup for free it is really good with rice definitely will go back here when i visit singapore again,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,work lunch singapore style pork rib broth endless broth  pieces of super tender pork ribs peppery white peppery broth needless to say i want more i had three bowls side dishes are bit salty it also came with a bowl of rice it is stereotypical singaporean small dishes and lots of soup i am not complaining but the broth soup thing must be lost on westerners who did not grow up with soup the soup is almost white in color and they refill it from a kettle made for tea thus the name translates into meat bone tea however this thick broth is exactly the kind of thing asians grew up on especially southern cantonese chinese i would love to come back but knowing my immediate family which i put them under the white people category this is not something they would be up for so save this meal trip with fellow soup aficionados,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i have only had malaysian version of pork rib soup prior i had no idea singaporean version was so peppery unlimited refills on broth we ordered their pork ribs loins premium ribs liver kidney every cut was perfectly prepared and extremely tender dipped in a bit of house made chili beyond delish soy braised pig trotters pork belly and pig intestines my fav was the melt in my mouth super cooked down collagen from the trotters the braising sauce was so tasty spoonful over rice you got yourself a perfect meal limited seatings but they are very efficient in getting tables ready also they begin taking your order as you stand in line so foods are served as soon as you are seated def check out song fa when in sg,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,if you like peppery as opposed to herbal bak kut teh this is one of the best places in town popular with asian tourists who come by bus loads to savour this delicacy in addition to the signature pork ribs they also have pork kidney large and small pork intestines chicken feet tofu skin pork belly the wait can be up to an hour in spite of them having two outlets almost next door to each other occasionally you see a hardcore caucasian customer more typically adventurous backpacker types rather than conservative bankers of lawyers but rarely south asian ones and almost never middle eastern ones,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,tea based ribs soup is the specialty here and it is deliciously soaked in the savory broth you will get one refill of the tea throughout the meal the appetizer combo is a good deal if you want to try out the different snacks but those can be skipped if you just go for the ribs now what is not fun is if there is a wait there is no a c here as everything is open air pretty much like a hawker center best to dine and go quickly,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this is my must eat everytime i visit singapore which is once or twice a year there are several locations but i believe new bridge road restaurant is the original and in my opinion the best the ribs soup is super flavorful and is to perfection everything else on the menu is yummy anything you get you will enjoy the only con to this location is no air conditioning if you can bare the heat and humidity i recommend this song fa location and definitely recommend bak kut teh restaurant,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,great broth so the staple item to order is the original bone in broth combo we ordered a few since we had a huge party so the pork rib is very tender and absolutely amazing it is flavorful and juicy we ordered some vegetables for the table bowl of rice and some other side dishes but honestly the pork rib soup the star of the entire place as you are eating your entire meal be careful not eat all of the meat immediately because they will come around and refill your broth the broth is sooo friggin good it is peppery and rich and just so amazing like i was able to enjoy rice with broth and it was so worth it i am not sure what their secret recipe is for the broth but you can tell they spend a lot of hours to make the broth they also sell packages of the broth seasoning in case you want to make it from home which i am a little upset that i did not buy if you are visiting singapore it is definitely a must to just stop in for a bowl of pork rib broth not necessary to order the other vegetables and side dishes but definitely order a bowl of rice to go with the soup make sure to maximize the number of refills i was able to get three,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,amazing ba kut teh pork rib soup i have been here several times and this place is always so crowded even though there are two of these almost right next to each other even though the waiting lines are always big it doesnt take that long the soup is a must try its peppery and clear rib is tender and you can get the soup refilled unlimited times side dishes like bok choy mustard pork belly etc are tasty as well must try place,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,such comfort food and it is always so delicious i always visit this place when i am back in singapore very reasonable price and very filling,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i have never had such a bad experience at any place except for this one first of all my  odd mother and eight year old son waited at the door for a long time finally the shop boy asked us if we had ordered it do you have a number we said we would just given the menu no number and no one asked us to order and he did not care he said you cannot do this and then he just skip us and take the people in the back i hurried to ask another shop assistant in the queue explaining the situation we have a small family of three people will not be stuttering cut in line cheating that the man was reasonable after arranging the group of guests in his hands we got to order food and order number when the food is ready we will order a small serving of bone tea and premium bone soup the soup is too little the shop originally has the service of free refill the soup however we have to call three times and to wait for a long time and the attitude of the service staff is particularly unfriendly i also asked the waiter if he had any tissue paper a waiter replied in a very bad tone the wipes are already on your desk i said i was asking for dry tissues and she answered impatiently for three dollars a pack i wonder why the staff here are all on gunpowder i just asked the most common questions and asked the most basic questions why should they treat their customers this way even if it is well established restaurant and long line at the door they should also do his job and should not be a big bully besides singapore has tons of choices for good food this one is definitely not good enough for me to swallow it that is it i am not coming back here anymore                          premium,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,felt a bit under the weather and was in the mood for something soupy but hearty song fa came through with a peppery broth with tasty pork ribs super busy during lunch but wait times are not long at all it is interesting to taste bak kut teh from different parts as they all taste different up in malaysia specifically klang their version is more herbal tasting i like it all to be honest so no complaints here when i am back in town i will have to make another visit,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,not sure why this place is considered one of the best places in singapore to get bak kut teh pork rib soup i understand that the broth is supposed to be garlic y peppery but the pepper taste was overwhelming the pork belly also tasted pretty average i got a stomachache after eating here which makes me think that their soup was filled with msg,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,popular bak kut teh peppery pork rib soup restaurant in sg with several branches throughout the city this restaurant lives up to its hype the bak kut teh has a strong pepper taste smell which is a big plus for me and the pork ribs are tender we also like the stewed pork belly which was guiltily satisfying the sides of braised tofu and preserved vegetable were also good portions were quite sizable  meaty ribs per bowl vibe a bit hectic busy but if you are ok with that then this is def a good spot to check out bring out of town guests to,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,it is ok i still prefer malaysian type bkt  very crowded but you wo not wait to long although the line looks so scary and long asf  price the soup is expensive than the sides but just try for once it is ok  taste the soup tastes nice and you can ask them to have more soup for free,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i always visit clark quay outlet the one opposite the bus stop the pork rid is always tender and the soup is pepper spicy you could get free refill of the soup usually i order one bak kut teh small rice if there are  of us we would order one more dish you tiao sour veggie or pork feet,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,definitely a must try i did not even know that song fa was a top rated must try for anyone in singapore i was aware of bak kut teh but did not really plan on seeking it out my uncle however was aware and arranged for my family to all go for dinner one night during our stay in singapore i had actually passed by this location while walking back to our hotel then we came back that same night to have dinner here there had already been a line when i passed earlier and there still was one when we arrived food is served fast so the line moves pretty quick customers are constantly moving through the restaurant at a fast rate we had a party of  and were split into three tables throughout the seating area you order food while you are waiting in line so the food arrived as soon as we sat down the soup was sooo good truly bottomless i was trying so hard to drink my soup as fast as possible but as soon as i was two sips away from the bottom the waitress would be refilling my soup eventually i did have to stop her as i was getting very full from the soup alone the pork rib itself was great came right off the bone and right into my big belly we also got some veggies as a side dish and some pork belly mmmmm my mom and bf both ended up buying their soup base packets cannot wait to try it out at home,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,lol this is the asian version of ribs instead of bbq grill and char that is drenched in sauce here you can have boiled ribs in a savory soup meat so tender and flavorful the soup it is super thin like most asian soup and so good for the two of us we ordered one order of ribsone veggie dish one pork belly sideone bowl of rice one small order or fried dough meal was more than enough to feed us both and very tastyservice was quick food came out quick too once all the food arrived to table they bring the check over when you are ready to pay walk up the bill to cashier,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,bak kut teh is one of those dishes that inspire a sense of heritage and at the same time could be a hot topic to debate over the style and where is the best now i am not claiming to be an expert by any means but song fa is producing a pretty impressive teocheow version that i would go back for more the flavors are simple pork ribs slowly cooked in a light pepper and garlic broth yet when you have the first sip of the broth you realize you are having something far more complicated the flavor is clean and to the point yet the layers that develop make you keep sipping till you forget that there are pork ribs to enjoy the pork was tender and at that point where it was still just about to fall of the bone yet not quite pliable where it became difficult to eat the side dish options are pretty respectable and give that nice balance of flavor that you end up craving service was quick and efficient as you wait in the line be prepared to order because the your dishes will arrive as soon as your butt hits the chair stool there is an efficiency to their process and you will be quick to enjoy your dishes while helping them keep their line moving definitely would go back it is quick service nice location and pretty impressive dishes make me a fan,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,made a trip out to this restaurant during my stay in singapore and i am so glad i did the food specifically the bak kut teh reminded me of home and it really hit the spot the meat is so tender and literally falls off the bone we got  large ones other dishes to share amongst  people and it was just the right amount of food however we all agreed that we each could have finished our own bak kut teh i recommend one per person they have both regular and large large more meat if i ever go back to singapore i will definitely visit song fa again,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,the waitress was very good at selling and convincing customers especially newbies tourists to order and try more dishes from the menu i like that song fa is bak kut teh has no soy or black sauce added to their soup broth strong and mostly white pepper flavor with subtle herbal essence not cheap eats small bowl with small portion very little soup when asked for soup refill we did not get it until the rd request soon after food was served server asked for payment and soon after payment was made service disappeared along with condiments tactics to get people to leave and not linger around,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i love the flavor of  the chinese medicine flavor is strong but i am chinese i totally accept it,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,woohoo as good as it gets this place never disappoints it serves the peppery variety of bak kut teh which is pork ribs in a tea soup concoction decor is beautiful and reminiscent of older times of singapore food is great gets very busy during its peak hours good restaurant,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,we love this location open as early as  am personal favor is the pork bone soup w the mei xien soup is unlimited refill i did not like the marinated pork interesting was too mushy to me,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,fun place for first day in singapore the pork rib soup is excellent upon viewing a long line we decided this place would be worth trying not disappointed with our decision the lines told the truth,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,one of the best bak kut teh you can find in singapore the tourists will always come here to visit and that is why the crowd can be bad the service is fast and good their best specialty is their prime rib soup i would recommend it to other people,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,we had their pork rib soup in the food court at marina bay sand and changi airport soups are really tasty and you get  ribs pricy but good soups,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i only like song fa after i discovered you can have sliced fish in the bkt broth instead of pork ribs yay the soup can be tasteless at times though after a top up it can pack a punch of peppery goodness it does not taste like it has been made with actual ribs slow cooking for hours lacking the natural sweetness and taste of home cooked soup as it is perennially crowded with tourists and locals the staff is very efficient in seating customers and clearing tables it really reminds me of the game diner dash i always feel like i am in the live version of it when eating here to shorten any potential time wasting diners are expected to pay when the food arrive just like in some coffee shops and hawker centers so you can just leave once you are done with your meal the pork ribs is tender but not that tender that the meat can slid right off without some coaxing the side dishes are ok i will only come here when i want sliced fish in bkt broth or if i am in the area otherwise there are probably other better bkt around i believe this is a cash only place,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,across the street from the shops at clarke quay the restaurant has two locations side by side the corner location seemed way more crowded so we hopped into the other side we ordered up some water chestnut waters to hydrate and got to looking at the menu beware of those wet naps those are not free and they will charge you   each if you do not want miscellaneous charges you just return the wet naps when you pay and they take it off your final bill i wished i knew that tidbit in advance for food we got the popular pork rib soup and a few other dishes like cai xin mustard greens braised chicken feet and braised pork belly to share among the three of us the pork ribs were tender and fell off the bone while the soup was heavy in white pepper it was not too spicy since the heat level dissipated after a few seconds it was so delicious the pork belly was super fatty gelatinous and flavorful the chicken feet for me was just comfort food both portions were relatively small but tasty the greens were there for balance haha anyway food is legit and service is very quick once the food arrives you pay before you eat so you can bounce out when you are done,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this is the original shop of a chain of bak kut teh restaurants the bak kut teh was well cooked with the meat just off the bone the meat is tender and flavourful the soup is peppery but not over powering the salty vegetables and tofu sheets are also quite good the service is good and the staff are friendly,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,very classic pepper flavor bak knut teh with perfect scale of spicy taste from pepper soup can be refilled a definitely a plus in this everything you need to pay country,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this is probably one of the best bak kut teh restaurant that i have tasted so far the you tiao is especially crispy on the outside and the soup is definitely flavourful which is worth trying,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,service is fast bak kut teh is similar with our food in the philippines so i was laughing when i have to try one here jn singapore dont get me wrong bak kuh teh is good and i like that they refill the soup when it is out unlimited broth anyone it will be a good experience for other people to try it at least i get to know what our nilaga is called in different country,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,despite having been to singapore more times than i can count and having even lived here for a year i would never had real bak kut teh other than the kind made by my mom which lets face it just is not as up to par until my cousin introduced me to song fa last year let is just say this place will be a must visit from now on the food is awesomely good plentiful and dirt cheap apparently everyone else feels the same way too given the crowds especially at lunch hour on weekdays the pork ribs and soup are are intensely flavored with pepper herbs and whole cloves of garlic do not miss out on the veggies which are incredibly good too total comfort food,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this place is bomb great service amazing food bah kut teh has such good flavor for the broth and the pork just falls off the bone the side dishes pork rolls is also a must,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,per recommendations and reviews this was my first bak kut teh here in singapore first off it is nice that there is the corner restaurant and the one a few doors down the corner one was busy so i went to the one that was indoors and was greeted by the person working the queue it was still busy but lucky me it was less than  minutes wait since it was toward the end of lunch also there was ac which was a nice break from the heat and while eating i ordered while i was waiting so the service was extra quick i had a bowl of bak kut teh and kai lan the soup was good but i found it was quite peppery the meat was flavorful tender and fell off the bone i initially thought there was not enough soup but they come around and top up your bowl with hot soup after you have eaten a rib so there is more room definitely a plus also give it a try and taste the meat with the condiments provided overall the service and people were nice food came quickly and it was flavorful and tender also the conscientious location is also a plus tip try to go during off peak hours so you have a shorter queuetip i believe it is cash only so be sure you have some on you you pay once you get your food at your table,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i just love this shop its innards like intestines is a must ordered toothough many competitors are coming out i find yahua  is too peppery for me and it is slightly more expensive some find founder bak kut teh with more herbal taste however i have not tried this one,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,the pork rib soup is solid here it is very flavorful and has a rich pork meat sweetness i really like it as it is very homey like something my mom makes the only downside is the price a large bowl is  without rice or anything also a cup of water is   so it is quite expensive i mean a plate of hainanese chicken rice runs under  in singapore but here you literally get three pork ribs in a bowl of clear soup but it is definitely tasty service was quick and friendly as well,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i was told this place is the original song fa bak kut teh in singapore and lines are usually pretty long for lunch and dinner can go up to an hour wait so my girlfriend decided this was something i had to have during my visit i do not recall what my husband ordered he had the spare rib soup that was boneless and said it tasted pretty regular my girlfriend ordered the fish which was surprisingly good not too fishy but the soup is pretty neutral i had their signature dish the black peppered spare rib soup its definitely different from what i have had before good but not wowed by it i am not sure if this is a local favorite dish but it feels like this is something neutral for tourists like me not too heavy and not super bland just the perfect balance in flavor to give you that savory taste but i was not wowed by this place in all honesty it was not something out of the ordinary and something quite simple to make at home i would not recommend it to any of my friends who wanted to visit singapore unless they want to eat on the safe side this is probably closest to safe without being too salty too sweet too strong or too overwhelming,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this is one of the must eat restaurant in singapore their bak kut teh is really flavorful expect a long line,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,founder of song fa bkt yeo eng song started serving bak kut teh from a pushcart stall in  nowadays song fa no longer operate from a pushcart but promise the same original fall off the bone tender pork ribs experience sadly what we had was far from that our premium loin ribs looked impressive but the meat was super tough and dry the standard ribs were surprisingly much softer and flavoursome the soup was not overwhelmingly peppery but just enough to make you sweat not the best bkt place we have been to unfortunately and there is nothing that would entice us to come back anytime soon,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,three things i love about this place  open early i like to eat lunch early like right at am sometimes some hawker stands are not even serving food at am but his place is always open and ready for me  fast service food is served in  minutes or less and you pay when the food is served no need to chase done the waitstaff to pay after your meal i wish more places did this  simple delicious food the food tastes fresh with simple clean flavors a lot of food in se asia includes tons of spice which can be overwhelming meal after meal the flavors here are much more subtle providing a nice change furthermore this is one of the few places i have found in singapore where it is easy to eat low carb slow carb just go sans rice and the price is right large soup s  side of veggies s  highly recommend,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,bak kut teh was something that was on my must eat list when visiting singapore with the help of yelpers in singapore i found song fa this place is legit as you can see lots of local people eating here get here early as they fill up fast and the lines get quite outrageous they even have a sign out front where they update how long the wait is for a table i love the interior decor makes it feel homey even though the tables are pretty close to each other the tables along the walls have their own sinks and heated tea pots for those who want hot tea the must order of course is their pork ribs bak kut teh the ribs are fall off the bone tender and the soup is full of garlic and peppery goodness get an order of noodles to eat with this soup and if you run low on soup they give free refills on soup their braised chicken feet with beancurd is also very good the chicken feet are braised very soft and the flavors are spot on they even sell soup packets for you to make your own bak kut teh at home just need to add garlic and ribs its about  blocks away from the clarke quay subway station so super convenient,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,pretty much everything i tried here was superb my favorite was the pork liver kidney and stomach bathes in pork rib broth the soup which they fill your bowl up without asking is excellent also get the full tea order and not by the cup better value buying a whole kettle the tea is very good had their specialty the pork rib soup it is very good but i liked liver kidney and stomach more amazing quality here everything was excellent,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,bak kut teh rich pork rib soupeverything at song fa is pretty delicious but their infamous bak kut teh is a must i kid you not but since coming back to the states i still salivate over this peppery pork soup mmm it is simple yet complexly delicious and who can resist unlimited broth refills yes unlimited added to your bowl granted when i was in sin it was super crazy hot and hard to put down hot liquids in my system but i can only imagine how much more delicious this meat bone tea would taste during the cold winter months the rich peppery taste can easily warm your stomach in fact with winter fast approaching it prompted me to write this review i am determined to find something comparable here in the states the meat from the pork ribs fell right off the bone and is best eaten with either a little bit of soy or a nice bowl of mee sua i prefer noodles over rice but i see others easily make rice soup with the brother and a nice bowl of rice craving something on the lighter side there is also plenty of veggie options beancurd skin chinese broccoli salted veggies to complement the meat palate keep in mind that song fa does get pretty crowded no matter what time of the day and you are often asked to share a table if you come alone with the constant amount of people it can get pretty stuffy from time to time however service is super quick and they make every effort to get their patrons in and seated as quick as possible,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,song fa solidi cannot believe it took me so long to get to this famous bak kut teh spot this clarke quay location always has a queue but when we visited over the weekend it was not too bad as they were out of the premium long ribs we settled for the regular pork rib soup at my first sip of soup i could tell right away that it was flavourful but not as peppery as founder is on balestier i still prefer founder is broth but do not get me wrong song fa is is still very very good for me a lot of bak kut teh places fall flat when it comes to the quality of the pork meat sometimes it is dry and tough which puts a damper on the dish however song fa passes this test with flying colours i was amazed at how juicy and tender their pork meat was how did they do it i guess that is their secret in my opinion this is where they are better than founder is i only deduct one star because i was not too much a fan of their you tiao i found it slightly greasy and not very fluffy it took me a while to really chew it til it got soft enough but overall i understand why people flock here it is location is tourist friendly the prices are good and the al fresco vibe really gives you a local singaporean experience,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,delicious pork rib soup with free soup refills tender pork belly and savory vegetables,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,there is almost always a line i am not sure i would wait more than   min but the bak kut teh here is definitely some of most flavorful and balanced i have had in singapore all too often other bkt broth are heavily salted or filled with msg not the case here very nice and service was efficient and quick bring cash,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,bak kut teh a singaporean classic that is a must try the fall off the bone pork rib is happily swimming in a tasty broth of classic chinese spice hard to describe divinely flavored looks like philippine sinigang but tastes uniquely all its own order the fried donuts to soak up the broth and you will be properly sorted during peak hours of lunch and dinner be ready to wait but trust me its well worth it,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,came back a second time and the bak kut teh was just as good we also got the braised pork belly this dish is a must as the meat was soooo tender and the fat just melted in your mouth xiao bai cai also very good veggies a perfect complement to all the meat,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,simple warming delicious and endlessly refilled broth which leaves you full and happy dirt cheap fast turnarounds and healthy bal kit teh is rightly an institution beware the queue at the original outlet check out one of the quieter but same quality branches,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i must confess i am not a huge fan of singapore style bahkuhteh so my review may be biased i prefer the malaysian style which is stronger in my opinion song fa is what singaporean bkt tastes like to me mild and peppery i ordered a small which was indeed quite small but it alright i probably wo not be able to finish a larger one anyway i know there are people who swear by it but for the others out there you are not alone perhaps you are just like me who prefer the stronger tasting malay style bkt p,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,best bak kut teh in singapore bak kut teh literally means pork bone tea in hokkein chinese dialect it was the poor man is broth back in the days but regarded as one of the national dishes of both singapore and malaysia song fa is one of the most popular bak kut teh places in singapore in fact they are so popular now that they ha e to open  more outlets along the same street within walking distance so that customers do not have to wait too long for their pork broth they have braised pork as well choose from pork ribs trotters organs liver kidney intestines etc,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,we ordered the pork rib soup intestines and sour mustard veggies the pork rib soup is fantastic very peppery which i love not sure about the other stuff on the menu as everyone else in the store got the ribs all the soups have the same soup base they just add in the different meats per your order also you can get additional soup added to your bowl do not forget to ask for some hot soup to be added to your bowl at the end of the meal,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,the soup is very peppery with the white pepper taste it can be quite comforting during a cold day but i had it on a hot day still good they refill your soup so you never run out the pork ribs are good but could have been soaked longer to bring out more flavor i happen to like my mom is better but this place shall do if you are not near homecooked food it is located pretty close to clarke quay mrt so it is convenient to get to,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,good for any foreigners since it is a very easily acceptable neutral soup taste and tender meat intestines are delicious sat outside with the fan blowing so strongly the hot soup turns into cold water in a matter of seconds overall i still prefer founder is bak kut teh for its awesome soup that last hot throughout and the very tender meats,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i have been here  months ago it was very good to help cure a hangover,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,there are two songfa bak kut teh locations within  feet of one another the one facing new bridge road is indoors the other wrapping around the street is outdoors considering the humidity of singapore i opted for the indoor songfa with rotating fans there were not many customers since it was past peak hours of lunch however at   pm during the first half hour into my dine couples groups of friends and a crew of middle aged men trickled in  of the restaurant was occupied half an hour later they stealthily left as they had come the interior contained black and white photos of clark quay and color photos of their dishes with questions sprouting in my mind regarding the food and its history i inquired the waitresses they did not speak much english so it was up to my imagination and google to answer my curiosities i ordered a small bowl of pork ribs soup also known as bak kut teh and meat bone soup the soup had a strong presence of black pepper the soft garlic cloves dissolved as you gently squeezed the meat out of them some of the pork ribs were soft others had a slightly dry texture even when rehydrated in the soup if you run low on hot soup ask a server for free refills usually bak kut teh is paired with rice or noodles instead i consumed it with a small plate of choi sum topped off with garlic chips the vegetables were seasoned just enough to have flavor but not so much that it would take away attention from the soup each table has a pot and mini sink you boil your own cup of tea as for me i drank their homemade water chestnut which can be ordered cold or warm it tasted medicinal with a slight sweetness my bill totaled to   sgd   usd and yes they charged  cents for the wet tissue dear singapore what do you have against dry napkins ps the tiny bathrooms here should be illegal consider using the toilet before eating eat first then go good luck every inch counts the men and women is bathroom should be combined aside from lavatory woes i would come back for more songfa bak kut teh,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,omg the line for bak kut teh on a friday night was crazily long thankfully my friends went early to queue and we got a table by the time i arrived service here is pretty fast and you pay on the spot when food is served i ordered the pork rib with pig stomach combo which was decent the pork rib was soft and the soup was peppery we also ordered kai lan salted vegetable and marinated pig intestine to share i love the pig intestine decently cleaned and marinated well not too salty i also appreciate how they come around and offer soup refills definitely recommended for a night bak kut teh hunt near clark quay,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,my favorite meal in singapore get the pork rib soup you have to get that do not get the premium pork loin soup it is just not as tasty in my opinion skip the pork belly unless you want super fatty chunks with not a lot of meat maybe it is meant to be eaten like that i do not know the broth in the pork rib soup is really something special okay i am a tourist so i do not know how it is supposed to taste or how genuine it is but i do travel a lot and i have never tasted anything quite like this the broth is perfectly salted and it has an herby smokey flavor very satisfying i liken it to a tea based broth in my opinion it was pretty inexpensive given it is in clarke quay  for a large bowl approx   us dollars overall its a great place for a tourist like me to get a taste of the local cuisine i felt like i was transported to another time and place a time when singapore was more simple and less of a global smart city which i think is pretty damn great fyi,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,peppery soup based quite okay depends on your taste cost us  for  persons the place is very crowded so just be prepared to wait for up to  min ambience is a little it noisy and slightly cramp definitely cannot stay there for a long time because of many patrons waiting outside,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i have never had bak kut teh before so my singaporean friends of course wanted to drag me here we came on a wednesday night with a party of  i heard the line would be quite long so i actually got there like   minutes before the rest of my friends got there and even though it was fairly busy i managed to snag a table quite quickly albeit right next to the door i guess i am pretty lucky anyways given that i was new to the entire thing i had my singaporean friends make recommendations on what to order i myself got a large bowl of pork ribs lime juice a bowl of rice and a pork trotter dish to share i did not actually know what trotter was and when i found out that trotter feet i was like oh that is obvious my friends said it was good so we got an order you get like  ribs with the large order the ribs themselves are very soft and tender bit lightly flavored as a lot of the flavor has gone into the soup but it was very good and what i expected the broth is great it is rich warm and delicious i loved the lime juice too i should get more lime juice drinks in the future as long as the mexican lime crisis concludes the trotter was decent perhaps not really to my taste though maybe i did not like the texture all in all it came out to be like  ish a person awesome price for delicious food would totally come back next time i am in singapore hooray for singaporean food,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,peppery soup broth i must be the rare ones who does not like gnawing on ribs so i do appreciate on a good soup it is refillable do not be disheartened by the queues it moves quickly based on my past few experiences i used to frequent the place in  when i was a student great place to catch up,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,pork ribs in peppery soup cooked singaporean style a must have says my local friend a legend his friends add okay fine let is gothirty minutes of waiting in line later we are seated on barely stable plastic chairs that essentially on the street i do not say this disparagingly some of the truly best food is at places that do not waste their time energy and money on needless pretensions our group ordered almost one of everything on the menu the famed ribs and the soup it came in was disappointingly average the meat tasted like most of the flavor was boiled out of it i guess the soup benefitted from that and you can get unlimited soup refills the thing is everyone loves that this soup is peppery but it is so peppery that the other flavors are overwhelmed it just seems counter productive that they went through a hard core famous cooking process to make great quality broth then mask it,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i learned this bak kut teh was yet another must try dish on the singapore foodie hit list and you must try it here at song fa so my local partners in crime got us a reservation at this hip and happening place for pork rib soup once seated we ordered the namesake dish some veggies and fried dough it came out rather fast was piping hot and looked delicious and the soup was delicious in a simple home cooked way the pork bones were meaty tender and my guide pointed out that there were  grades of pork rib bones but looked similar to me i noticed there was a lot of white pepper used to flavor the broth so who woulda thought the simple clear soup mom has been making for the last  years was a close version of the bak kut teh now that i have came saw and experienced i know how to glam up mom is brew,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,queue can get pretty long so best to go early and avoid lunch and dinner crowds the soup is a bit spicy but there is a slight herbal taste and the meat that comes along is soft and tender the you tiao that came along could be fresher and less oily i suppose however thats not the main dish so screw it non singaporeans take not that you can always ask for refill for soup,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,song fa bak kut teh is truly one of the great bak kut teh locations in singapore if you are familiar with my reviews you know i am a huge fan of bak kut teh singapore is pork rib pepper soup i came to song fa on a rainy saturday on the back drop of lky is passing the restaurant was full of locals who had spent hours in line to pay their last respects to mr lee who lay temporarily at parliament less than km away given the rainy weather outside and the somber mood that singapore has experienced this past week there is no better dish than in my view bak kut teh to warm a person is heart i ordered the premium pork rib soup but to my disappointment it was of out stock i settled on the regular pork rib soup which to my great surprise was tender and moist regular pork rib orders at other bak kut teh establishments are generally quite dry although i find founders bak kut teh in balestier to be my personal favorite song fa is a very close second if you are a visitor to singapore and do not want to venture outside the cbd area or travel to balestier road then song fa is your best to try this famous sg dish,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this is probably the most crowded bak kut teh everyone loves this place i think the soup is quite nice and spiciness is relatively mild compared to others when are go try to avoid after   the queue is unbelievably long if you go in the morning you can grab a seat right away try and see,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,traditional and delicious food really good place to eat good service and good price down site you have to wait for  to  min,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,throughout my years of living in the lion city of singapore there are a few foods that seem to make virtually every top  foods of singapore list one of those dishes is bak kut teh or pork rib soup and our favorite place to eat this delectable goodness is songfa bak kut teh according to the songfa website bak kut teh is a chinese soup popularly served in singapore the name literally translates as meat bone tea and at its simplest consists of meaty pork ribs in a complex broth of herbs and spices boiled together with pork bones for hours bak kut teh was introduced to malaya in the th century by chinese workers from canton chaoshan and fujian so what does this mean to the average joe like you or i not too much other than to know that this is a historically simple and good dish that has been served on this side of the planet for eons and it is damn good songfa is always crowded and they move people through quickly think of it as local fast food the menu is filled with a lot of local delicacies that may be a bit tough for an untested western palette like pig organ soup or braised chicken feet but if i may be so bold order this pork ribs soup dough fritters kai lan you wo not be disappointed and the best part the broth is bottomless so the goodness will keep on going i know it might seem odd to get excited about soup in the warm muggy climate of singapore but the flavors make up for it this is home cooking at its local fast food finest so if you are near the quays and looking for something quick cheap and filling i heartily recommend songfa bak kut teh the goodness will not disappoint,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,there is always a queue for this place and now i know why the service is super quick considering the number of tables and i love how they continually come by to refill your bowl with steaming soup we had the jumbo ribs  with the braised trotters intestines and salted veg the soup is the clear and peppery type and the ribs where pretty tender went well with the dark sauce though not a bak kut teh fan after this i may be converted,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,one of my top  favorite places for bak kuh teh out of over  voted best places for bak kuh teh in singapore song fa has several stores and they are all in quite centrally located locations where tourists could easily go to whereas my other favorite place ng ah siu is near little india which may be more challenging for tourists to find make sure you order the special kung fu tea several different varieties to choose from and they are all good and their taste is distinguishable if you have tried all of them served in small cups to complement your soup,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,great and simple bak kut teh the new queuing system helped organize the crowd too remember to order spare ribs and get your free soup top ups visited this outlet in april with my friends from the uk,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i stopped by this place having heard great things about it and i was not let down i was not able to try many dishes but was able to try the bak kut teh which was pricier than expected  sgd because overall shops like these are usually a bit cheaper but it was worth it the broth had amazing flavor was at a perfect temperature and i got good sized pieces of meat with it so like i said definitely worth it everyone needs to give it a try,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,it turns out i have been having fake bak kut the for my life so far i love soup asian soup in all style chinese mushroom or fish soup tomato with pork bones hong kong style and japanese ramen base nail me and bak kut teh appears among my second ring for soup preferences the ones we have in hk tends to be heavy in herbs it always tastes rather bitter with a chinese medicine smell and served in those brown clay pot which totally make a medi dish but the soup remains sweet salty and fresh i know this sounds wired but it is one of the best pork bone dish okay let us talk about the authenticity here in s pore pure soup pure pork bone soup with herbs seafood some grandma is soup not those  hour canto style very simple homemade soup i almost doubt was there any msg haha the drinks sucks here oh soup is free refill chew that bone and pour the great souppppppppp,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,lunch time is sooo crowded be sure to go early to avoid the lines i reckon the queue has more to do with singaporean is obsession with the dish more than anything most bakuteh joints in singapore are pretty decent it is a national staple  the pork broth was great they could be a bit more generous with the pork ribs though  you tiao is cold and soggy do not order unless you intend only to dip it in the soup commonly eaten this way in singapore then its lack of crispiness is tolerable  would not recommend ordering the pig is throttles in black sauce too much pig skin and fats very little meat price range  per pax,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,it is crazy busy but the lines move fast there is also a constant stream of tourists so i suspect they are listed on certain travel guides the bkt is decent marginally good sometimes it also depends on the day but definitely pepperish and garlicky the pig trotters is a good side dish to share if you do not mind the fats it is braised till it is tender and melt in your mouth,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,as delicious as bak kut teh is with all the spices and pepper this was only mediocre compared to other places i have had it in singapore unlike reviews of others there was absolutely no line up and in fact tons of empty tables when i came by on a thursday night however the bak kut teh was the only soup left available so i did not get the chance to try any of the other  soups they had on the menu i do love the amount of pepper i do love the tender pieces of pork i do love the continuous broth refill the parts that were missing for me are the melt in your mouth cloves of garlic that usually come in it such a key ingredient i also enjoy the versions that have some cilantro to top it off we also tried the marinated pig intestines and although decent flavour it was not up to par in terms of texture a bit broken down and did not have the chew that i desire when i eat innards,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i love their fish slices bak kut teh awesome peppery soup without the cholesterol of pork ribs pretty standard tasting compared to he balestier ones service is awesome love how they are ever ready to refill my soup,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,my absolute favorite bak kut teh in sg it is always busy menu is simple but made perfection service is quick food comes in  mins max even when the house if full must try kidney soup and pork rib soup as well as bean curd skin the soup is pepper based and can get spicy service is per singapore standards most probably you will have to queue but it is worth it,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,best place to have your first and authentic bah kuh teh when you visit singapore the long line up is complemented by their quick service do not forget the you tiao when you order your bah kuh teh otherwise your experience wo not be complete also check out their braised pig trotter and steamed kailan i have no words to describe it except you will miss it when you leave singapore it is an eatery by the roadside and i recommend you eat there at night in case you will be seated outside to avoid the searing asian heat,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i have a strong preference for klang style hokkien bak kut teh over our more common teochew style white pepper bak kut teh in singapore but when once needs a bak kut teh fix in the middle of town song fa is a trusty option you can rely on it does not hit the spot for me i want dark soup but it does fix my weird chinese need to drink very hot things on a hot afternoon most afternoons,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,its a long line and super famous but good that their turnaround is fast we have  people and it was very crowded and hard to sit there is not ac so very hot their bak kut teh is amazing we ordered so many bowls their other items such as fried fritters and organs stuff were not so good though we also tried the sliced fish soup and intestine liver are not good either just stick to bak kut teh,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,the soup at song fa is pretty good nice and peppery but definitely not the best the pork ribs we got the premium were a bit too tough and i would not recommend them the thing that makes song fa stand out the thing that makes them truly exceptional is the pork loin get this it is amazingly tender and the soup is even more peppery than the normal soup the kidney and liver were also perfect for me i prefer my kidney cut a bit thicker with the x cuts that make them look like cooked cuttlefish and that is how they do them here delicious,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,so i came here after getting off the clark quay mrt stop crossed the street and saw two song fa bak khu tehs one is open air and on the corner the other one down the block a bit and air conditioned i said to myself hells no man get your butt in the air conditioned song fa bak kut teh so off i go with the princess to get some meat bone tea we head inside the aircon room and get a little table for two i ask for the favorite and get the following  plain rice   wet tissue   pork ribs soup   premium loin ribs   home made ice lemon tea  food was fantastic and very affordable there is also a pot of tea next to the wall and a water dispenser that you should not wash your hands in or use as a chewing tobacco receptable the princess did not eat her pork because it was too spicy spicy for  year olds but not spice for us in our late s,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this is the best bakut teh in singapore for me it use pepper instead of chinese herb and it has international taste though i know some singaporean prefer the other bakut teh i always bring visitors to this song fa bakut teh and they love it,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i like the ambience of the place the table i sat on has a tap beside me and that really served me well in cleaning the cups etc i have not had the authentic feel of enjoying a bak kut teh with tea cups and boiler for such a long time most places serve their tea in plastic cups the meat is tender and neither too hard nor too soft the service is pretty alright and average what else i think if you would like an above average bak kut teh with a reasonable comfortable ambience which is not too expensive and yet located in a very centralised place its just opposite the central the question you have to ask yourself is why not,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i am not an expert at singapore style teochew style peppery bak kut teh i far far prefer the herby klang version one finds over in malaysia for that reason i tend to avoid bak kut teh in singapore and have not had this in a very long time but a group dinner where the decision was out of my hands forced me back into the clear peppery pork land of songfa is this a good or bad version of singapore bkt i do not know guys i do not like the dish that much so it is hard for me to say i can tell you that i found the ribs to be of average quality the meat just did not fall off the bone the way it should have having said that i was pleasantly surprised by the tenderloin pork i am pretty lazy so having my pork chopped up in bite size chunks versus needing to gnaw at big bits of bone was kind of nice i also like how they keep refilling the soup it would be even better if it was the herby klang soup but no matter warm soup is always a pleasure but i must admit i am rather mystified by the tea arrangement why do i get my tea in a packet of leaves and then have to boil my own water i just do not get it but then like i said i am pretty lazy,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,one of the more popular pork rib soup in singapore they claim to be the authentic and flavorful it is a popular franchise now which means they have multiple outlet in singapore it is worth a try as the price are reasonable this branch is usually crowded during lunch time,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,great place to get your bkt fix surprisingly nice addition is their traditional chinese tea sets slightly on the pricey end when it comes to bkt but the food meets the expectation,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,one of the best bak kut teh places in town long queues at the original location but worth the wait for the peppery broth tasty pork ribs and nice fixings they serve up,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,on cold nights or rainy days i often find myself craving for hot peppery soup and that is when i will head down to song fa ba kut teh to warm up my shivering tummy my favorite bkt is the clear soup otherwise called white soup which is packed with lotsa black and white pepper not a fan of the black herbal sort too much herbs for me verdict the soup is not bad savory enough and is very aromatic the meat is so tender it peels off the bone with a light tug of your teeth the ribs absorbs the flavor of the soup so thoroughly you do not even have to dip it in too much dark sauce to give it the extra flavor i have tried both the premium and the regular ribs here and the regular ones are much better trust me on this one the regular rib is better than founder is premium ribs as well for  you would get the large bowl and that is about  ribs on good days i can finish that by myself if you want more food other dishes such as the braised intestines really well marinated and clean pork trotters braised and melt in your mouth meat chicken feet i do not eat this etc are pretty awesome too if you like variety you could go for the mixed soup of your choice you could choose ribs stomach tail bone etc in the pork bone soup me i would just go for the regular pork rib bkt there are  outlets along new bridge road i always go to the air conditioned one it is from the same kitchen and the prices are the same so why not dine in comfort right,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,really enjoyed this dish when i was visiting singapore back in november  whilst staying in clarke quay area i randomly stumbled upon this restaurant on one of my walks around town having been told that bak kut teh is supposed to be the singaporean dish to be tried i figured it would not hurt to give it a go i ordered one order of bkt one order of pork knuckle and one order of steamed rice everything was brought out lightning quick which was perfect since i was seriously starved oh i should mention that smaller the group the quicker you get seated in between customers me having gone solo i was given a seat almost instantly food was excellent although i cannot compare the bkt to any other place as i did not have the time to go check out other places i will say though one of my favourite meals in singapore was this,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,pretty good alil on the pricey side i wld give it   stars if i could service is inconsistent it will give you a good bowl of bak kut teh,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i just love the way this restaurant serves the food and tea it just brings you back in time the pork bkt is still the best they have fish as well a light and refreshing soup that goes well with plain rice or the fried donut stick the seasoning flavoring is well balanced this would be a wonderful meal to have on a cold winter day but in the swearting heat it is just satisfying,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this place is touristy kitschy crowded and does a decent pig trotter it is better than ng ah sio probably on the same level as founder is and loses to the still best eng kee which i have yet to photograph in ang mo kio peppery soup tender braised trotters moderately pissed off service this place serves up an average soup fatty but at least with a reasonable amount of meat salty but no immediate salt burn and very peppery which is a quality i appreciate decent flavor in the broth though none of that natural sweetness you would associate with good soup a general lack suffered by many of the more commercial stalls they have a fair selection of veg here mostly done up blanched and tossed with sesame oil soy sauce and diced garlic decently green enough for a good clean flavor to break up the pork and not overcooked even if a little watery but let is talk about my favorite dish the braised pork trotter it is a chunky dice as opposed to the more finely diced and mixed cut at ng ah sio and the whole trotter served at founder is with a good mix of meat and fat i had two dishes of this which attests to gluttony and tolerance in the face of a favorite dish to the comfortingly tender meat and decent flavor no overtly gamey porkiness here if you are afraid of that and the braise is tasty,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,my ex and i stalked all the hyped bkt places over  different places in singapore and kept coming back to this one the queue was extremely long when we came in the evening but found that the wait was cut in half to sit inside i am not sure if people were aware that you could sit inside to the right of the tables we get the premium ribs there is a difference in quality the broth is a good balance of pepper and garlic though as a garlic lover i ask for extra the meat is nice and tender and of course the savory broth is all you can slurp i wished the youtiao was fresher hot and crispy when it comes out but it is not bad with rice we also got kway chop but it was too salty and the texture was off song fa is definitely a solid choice,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,have gone past this place on the bus many many times but never got a reason to go in and try it i love bkt btw even though i am usually not too hot on pork so my friend greg and i were just looking for a place to eat and we settled on this and we had a great time we got the pork ribs soup   a side of vegetables and some you tiao to eat with the dark sauce and soup yum service was quick we had our respective refills of soup yummy and the pork ribs are tender the soup tastes delicious though the atmosphere is pretty un conducive for a conversation but the purpose of these old fashioned bkt shops is to get your fill and get the hell out will make a return trip here if the occasion arises,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,very fast and attentive service good bak kut teh and the accompanying pepper soup have a fish version as well easily one of the top  bak kut teh places in singapore,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,if you are looking for an authentic place to get your fix of ba ku the song fa is the place to go located just opposite the central shopping mall at clark quay it is in a sufficiently accessible spot that is not too far flung in the heartlands of singapore the joint itself looks like an ungraded version of the usual coffee shop stalls with air conditioning and occupying up to  units at the corner of the building they serve the usual soup with generous helpings of succulent meat with the delicious boiled all day taste that our grannies used to make for us and soups are refillable it is a nice homey touch to a modern day looking restaurant that adds a dash of nostalgia of the olden days the soup is not too peppery and still thick enough with both spices and meat so it is actually possible for young kids to mix it with plain rice for a meal without any additional seasoning their side dishes are also yummy like pork innards if you find that acceptable and honestly locals have no qualms since it is considered as quite the delicacy and good for our health somehow,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i love the noodle there most of bak kut teh store only serve rice so if you are noodle lover must try,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,really good soup and a really good price great brunch,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,pork rib soup is simple but so good my husband and i were suppose to have dinner at another place but that place was closed but i had this place booked mark we walked from our hotel to this place which was about a little over a mile when we arrived there was no line but the place was  full they do not have a very extensive menu because they specialize in pork rib soup we both got a bowl of soup a bowl of rice and the husband order pig intestines we both ordered drinks too we were both hot from the walk the soups came out fairly quick and the intestines our drinks came out soon after the soup was amazing even when it was hot out the pork falls right off the bone and they give you fresh red chili and you add your own soy sauce the intestine were really good too they were braised in a sweet soy sauce our drinks were good too we ordered a barley and  lime juices i think lime juice is singapores version of lemonade our meal was super cheap before we left singapore we made another stop for more soup and this time i learned you can ask for more soup broth we bought the soup packets to bring home to recreate the soup i hope it will taste just like it,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,my favorite bak kut teh is the clear soup otherwise called white soup which is packed with lots of black and white pepper not a fan of the black herbal sort too much herbs for me the you tiao was not that crispy because i guessed it was pre fried but it did not really matter because we were drowning it in the soup anyway the soft dough with all the soup absorbed is just plain happiness this is the new store that opened near the old stall it actually looks more clean and spacious compared to the old shop front but it somehow lacks the old feel like this one feels more commercialized and less authentic but the favorite bak kut teh is still nice it is located conveniently near clarke quay mrt station once you step out at the burger king side you can see it opposite the road one of the better favorite bak kut teh i have tried so far,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,the bak kut teh here is the clear peppery kind it is across the road from central cross the road and head to the junction it is exactly at the corner of new bridge road and upper circular road very crowded in the evenings they a pretty good variety of different parts that you can have in your soup you have the usual ribs tenderloin or offal like liver kidneys stomach as i am usually too lazy to remove the bones from the ribs i usually get the tenderloin mixed with stomachthey also do a pretty decent braised intestine if you feel like it the soup is light and delicate which is good if you do do not want something very over powering,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,very crowded during meal times come early for folks who loves cooking they sell the spice too good for tourist who wants to bring local spices home as gifts,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,dont understand the hype really seriously always seen a really long queue loads and loads of people waiting for a seat so finally one day when the queue was not that long and when you go on your own its usually not that hard to get a table for one i got myself a seat and ordered and i was very disappointed yes people may say that ya ya you from malaysia you are use to a different type of bkt my reply yes malaysia has different types of bkt for example klang bkt which is more gravy that soup and oh so flavourful i am from kk where bkt is very much like those found here but tastes sooooooooo much better i am use to something more herbal based or some more pepper base but always with clear soup so i was disappointed and wonder still why the reviews are so good i ordered the most basic of pork ribs and a side of vege and of course deep fried dough fritters did not really enjoy the meal mind you i had decent bkt here in singapore before just not at this place,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,there is  locations on the same block the difference is one has ac and the other does not i tried to come here x and there were always lines during lunch the lines were a bit shorter waited about  minutes i had this dish a few years back on my last trip to singapore this time the soup taste more soupy and did not have the same taste as last time i am not sure what the real bak kut teh tastes like,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,the pork is really tender soup is not too spicy really appetizing heard they are even found in indonesia these days,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,the best and last bak kut teh i had such a humble yet comforting dish that i now miss very dearly a great dinner place before a night out in clarke quay,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this ba ku teh is too overrated its crowded hot noisy the ba ku is so hard like a stone but the soup is not bad however there are better ones else where sorry for being harsh but this is too commercialize and it did survive because of its good location,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,note that there are two song fas on the same street they are the same restaurant just that the one on the street corner is more kopitiam all outdoor and the one further down nearer the traffic light has air conditioning go early because the queues are long otherwise you have to stand in line while imagining a juicy pork rib in between your teeth,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,damn good bak kut teh had me two orders and i long to return,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,my favourite place for bah kut teh i like everything here except the crowd,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,amazing breakfast spot we tried the ultimate combo perfect portion size and good price sat outside and watched city go by croissants were amazing and perfectly baked served hot with new zealand anchor butter service was really great with a smile food came fast perfect breakfast spot clean restrooms,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,one of the best brunches i have had in a long time reminded me of the hipster brunch places in pdx which is always a good first sign they have delicious coffee a second good sign great vibe too and its a hole in the wall place below a nondescript hbd complex but easy enough to get too via mrt bus i got the smoked salmon with scrambled eggs and a baked tomato the salmon was fresh eggs were done perfectly wife got the baked eggs which were delicious cupcake sized baked eggs wrapped in bacon on brioche just mouth watering had the affogato to wrap up brunch and the espresso was just delicious warm earthy tones that paired well with the salted caramel ice cream must try place in sgp,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,this was actually our first meal in singapore and it was absolutely delicious i got the iced orange mocha and the norwegian smoked salmon scrambled eggs the mocha had a great flavor and was not too sweet my actual meal came with a lot of fresh avocado slices and was just the perfect hearty and healthy breakfast that i needed the workers were so friendly and the place is extremely aesthetic my friend really wanted to come back to try their other foods but unfortunately there were just so many places to try definitely my favorite brunch place when we were there though,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,one of the best brunch places we went to in singapore i ordered an iced coffee truffle scrambled eggs and avocado bruschetta which were all delicious i would only recommend the truffle scrambled eggs if you know you are a fan of truffle oil as the taste can be a little strong the coffee and appetizers were great on top of this servers went out of their way to be kind and even ran after us outside when we forgot a pair of glasses at our table,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,the good a local business service is you get seated then you order food from the counter when it is ready they deliver it to you at your table very straightforward delicious healthy fare go for brunch i had the eggs with mushrooms and bacon and it was so yummy they also serve coffee tea and pastries they take credit cardsthe bad can get really really crowded during peak times not ideal for large groups small groups are fine but if you want to come here with a group larger than   people you are going to struggle to find a place for you allthe ugly nonewould i go back for certain this place is a really great charming casual dining experience that makes me feel like i am back in the states this place is in,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,ok wow we were dropped off a block away and got nervous due to the other stores on the shopping strip but do not turn back keep going and make it to tolido is there is a huge menu of coffee drinks both safe choices as well as local inspired creations iced coffe ice blends and espresso drinks alike the food menu offers unique items with fresh ingredients like smoked salmon lox and sausages they have an all day menu and a entree menu with seafood and pastas we had the rsti with smoked salmon as well as baked eggs with capers and fresh dill so satisfying thanks tolido is,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,having stayed in singapore numerous times we discovered this place through trip adviser and what a great find as we tire of hotel buffets so we revisited again to discover it is still as good as  months ago i am not into coffee but anna and rated it highly all coffees are double shot unless single preferred milk options a little light compared to australia ie almond milk the food serves are generous and really tasty as displayed in the photos plenty of truffle in the eggs and cherry tomatoes in the shakshouka we have not had lunch here so cannot comment on the dishes to the right of the menu highly recommend toledo is,Positive

tolidos-espresso-nook,this is my first time to singapore and tolido is was a great recommendation service was great atmosphere was pleasant and the food was amazing the portions were very nice and i will be back,Positive

tolidos-espresso-nook,this is going to be one of my new favourite brunch places we found the recommendation online and in spite of the difficulty in finding good parking spots this place is definitely worth thevisit it reminds me of the cafes that you would find in melbourne sydney locals and travellers seem to know of this place as it was packed on a saturday morning their version of baked eggs brought us back to our favourite haunts in sydney and their pandan pancake was delightful with its full pandas flavour and gula melaka on the side they serve their coffee with a standard double shot while the kinds of food is not revolutionary they do it very well one of the major plus points to this place is the lower price of food compared to other similar establishments most items are priced in the   dollar range i am going to keep this place in my rotating list of brunch places,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,prawns for breakfast sure why not this is a cute place to have both singapore based food and the american breakfast both utterly crucial to where me and my boyfriend were going to eat he wanted american vs i wanted singapore food tolido is came to the rescue although the walk was a bit of a hike from where we were staying bugis shopping mall area it was worth the walk the service was spot on and the wait was not too terrible granted i still recommend making reservations if you want a spot inside it can get pretty busy otherwise,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,tolido is espresso nook is a great little breakfast place tolido is is a cute little place in singapore that while not particularly convenient is definitely worth walking over to neither the coffee nor the sweet breakfast is the best i have ever had but both were definitely pretty solid and service was appropriately quick it is hard to complain in that regard i got in had a good breakfast and got out in less than  minutes,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,pretty good spot is extremely busy on the weekend but easy to sit right down on a week day wide variety of coffee type drinks including blended and smoothie options food was fine general western style breakfast type stuff,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,double shot coffee at a much lower price than starbucks and with a wonderful latte art i say kudos to the owner as passion for good coffee shows service was also efficient and food wonderful only thing is you got to be patient for the wait as good things come to those who waits,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,i have only tried their blended matcha latte and i must say it was the best matcha drink i have ever tasted will definitely come back to try more of their food and drinks,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,tolido is is a nice escape from the heat and an intimate setting with incredible food if i spent more time in singapore i would definitely become a regular to start the pandan waffles are just amazing an incredible blend of pandan topped with coconut ice cream but of course i could not just stop there i decided to go all out and also ordered the truffle eggs a combination i would not have thought of on my own but it could not have been more perfect i still dream about the food here amazingly delicious,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,great menu and service though go early on weekends if you do not want to queue coffee was fabulous as was the hot chocolate,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,one of our finds for sunday brunches good coffee and all day breakfast the sea salt caramel latte was heavenly cafe had a nice relaxed vibe,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,we have been here twice now definitely make a reservation and sit inside unless you are just looking for a quick coffee the food is unbelievably good here i highly recommend the pandan pancakes,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,i love the banana pancakes they serve they have some nice caramelization on the bananas whip cream and drizzled caramel sauce to ensure you get some sweet and salty on each bite and the pancakes are flawlessly fluffy i got the cappuccino to wash it sown ahem both times i have been the staff are also very sweet and attentive i have been on a sunday each time and despite the full house of customers i have not had to wait for a spot to sit,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,enjoyed sea salt spiced chai latte and cereal bacon rolls both delicious nice atmosphere and a wonderful breakfast menu served all day,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,excellent baked egg royale brioche was awesome with wasabi cream cheese highly recommend,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,by far my new favorite breakfast spot in singapore reasonable prices for singapore great food friendly staff and an all day hip vibe we will be back tomorrow,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,the ambience is fabulous and the decor is hip a great hangout for youngsters for sure love the cakes latte and cappuccino and the service is impeccable the price is slightly steep i would really love to hangout here if parking is easier,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,i had a flat white and was very pleased they used yahava beans the coffee was great second only to yahava the barista was also very friendly taking the time to explain what a kopi latte was and recommend some choice picks at the cafe apparently the barista came in third at a singapore latte art competition as we were stuffed we did not order any food but we saw many orders for the pandan pancake which looked sumptuous we will be back to try that the place was doing a roaring trade on a sunday afternoon,Negative
tolidos-espresso-nook,finally a delicious brunch spot in singapore that does not charge an arm and a leg for a decent meal located at an hdb block about an  minute walk from both lavender and bugis mrt stops tolido provides fantastic all day breakfast items along with a robust pasta menu with most menu items priced between s   i left the cafe feeling full and satisfied they also take reservations over the phone which makes getting a coveted spot indoors very feasible will definitely be coming back again to try some of the other items on the menu,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,i am so happy that we found tolido is espresso nook the place is cute as a button trendy comfortable and friendly the coffee is on point the staff is awesome and the breakfast we had was excellent we really enjoyed the vibe and the laid back atmosphere just what the dr ordered while on vacation do not delay go today,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,first time here good vibes hit me as soon as i walked thru the doors hmmm good start i thought to myself super friendly and happy staff checkedtasty yummy food checkedawesome coffee checkedaffordable prices checkedfairly accessible checked either  mins walk from lavender mrt or park at nearby hdb parking lots behind had the croissant with scrambled eggs and streaky bacon rosti with sunny side egg and bratwurst recommended by staff pandan pancakes with vanilla ice cream and gula melaka sauce hhhhhhhnnnn few cuppa flat whites walked out with a happy tummy and a smile on my face kudos tolido is i will be back for sure d,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,another hipster cafe great there are not enough of them to go round this little island the food is generally tasty standard fare that you would expect from a regular hipster cafe likewise for decor it may not necessary wow you but it certainly is not poorly done up would i recommend it yes if you happen to be in the neighborhood,Negative
tolidos-espresso-nook,i am so happy to find so many cozy cafes popping up around the island and it is always heartening to see local spins on usual brunch items the one thing that stood out to me on the menu was an sg special pandan pancakes do not expect it to be like a pandan chiffon cake because duh it is a pancake but they were still delightfully fluffy and i easily downed the whole plate of three they currently have pineapple waffles for cny and i would be back to try if i have the time one star off for the rather overwhelming truffle oil smell that hits you when you walk in i like them truffle fries but do not really want to smell like one,Negative
tolidos-espresso-nook,after the giant surge of cafes opening up in singapore in the past  years i confess i have been biased against cafe food because they tend to be a standard cookie cutter menu in some sort of hipster backdrop we came here on a public holiday for lunch and waited about  minutes for a place for two inside we ordered an ice blended chocolate an ice blended coffee strawberry cream cheese pancakes and bratwurst on a rosti oh man i do love the food here the food here did not take too long and the drinks were decent and not overly sweet and they do ask if you want whipped cream on or off your ice blended drinks the cream cheese pancakes are two giant fluffy pancakes with a lot of cream cheese custard filled in between the two and strawberry sauce drizzled all over i am glad we got a savory other dish because we were sugar overloaded but happy nonetheless the crispy rosti really deserves a special mention with two bratwursts a fried sunny side up and sour cream would be even better with green scallions on top but this is as good as it gets i would come back again and again oh and free wifi,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,this little coffee shop was a great escape from the heat the interior reminded me of coffee shops that you find in the northwest i got the affogato ice cream with espresso both the coffee ice cream were of superior quality making it a wonderful afternoon snack on a hot day,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,i liked the gula melaka pancake for local tastebuds that is the bomb sadly service was a huge disappointment person taking orders was abit rude and unable to customise orders like adding cheese to egg was like super challenging and he does not know the ingredients well so was clueless most of the time it feels like mostly a student hangout place coffee is not bad,Negative
tolidos-espresso-nook,love love love tolido who cannot resist a charming neighborhood hangout that boasts a top notch barista and a kitchen that can whip up a seriously good breakfast meal not to mention an assortment of pastas i went here with my wife for our usual sunday brunch where we normally try to recover from a night of going out by eating a filling breakfast i ordered the banana pancakes yum while my wife ordered the french toast double yum what stood out to me was not just the great taste and the beautiful presentation but rather the intangibles specifically the soul and love that was put into each dish and each cup of coffee made for that matter it definitely brought me back to that feeling when my parents used to serve me banana pancakes when i was a young boy so much can be said of tolido but i will some it up by these select adjectives welcoming charming neighborly pleasant and cozy did i mention the all day breakfast count me in kudos to douglas for introducing himself to my wife and i and making us feel at home,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,loved it you have to get the sea salt caramel latte blended it is better than starbucks great food had pancakes eggs cheese sausage one morning and potatoes eggs cheese sausage the next day this place is a must if you want to brunch,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,their food is so delicious here everyone in my group  people including young kids all loved their food their coffee is really delicious as well,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,i have to admit this place was not the easiest to find but the food is good and it comes out very quick after you order even when it is a full house we ordered the tolido pancakes and  egg omelette the bacon was so good need more of that the pancakes are so light and fluffy def a treat for me the egg omelettes are also very fluffy and almost liquidy on the inside update th sept  so now that it is my rd time here i decided to try the ultimate combo and it is delicious the bacon smelt so good it would make anyone hungry the pancakes were just as good they may look like normal pancakes but just wait till you put them into your mouth it is so fluffy and tasty the rosti with cheese sausages for   is a good price and the rosti is delish i did have to tell them to cook with less oil as the last time i had it my plate was flooded with a layer of oil i need to visit here more often to checkout more menu items like the cereal bacon,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,very good breakfast with reasonable prices we had the bacon and eggs croissant banana almond french toast and waffle jammer americano coffee with one shot was more like coffee in the states,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,my friend has been telling me about their pandan pancakes for a while so after lunch at kampong glam we decided to get some dessert and coffee at tolido it was still buzzing with the lunch crowd but emptied out pretty soon after   my stack of three pandan pancakes were good fluffy with a whiff of pandan they were great with the ice cream and gula melaka drizzle i had the perfect salted caramel latte too smooth milky and rich enough to leave you wanting i like that unlike some cafes they have their act together and the staff are smiling win and tip if you are impressed ok that is how we spread the love,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,great little cafe one of our favorite spots during our trip to singapore great food atmosphere and coffee,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,good vibe good food came here based on yelp reviews for breakfast my husband ordered pancakes and the pumpkin spice latte he really enjoyed his meal which is a plus i ordered the laksa prawn noodle as i wanted to try what locals love to eat it was good but probably not my favorite flavor staff is nice here and the restaurant is a nice place to relax and have a wonderful time worth a visit,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,been hearing all the raving about this place from a bunch and friends and i finally got to visit today and it didnt disappoint while small it is not too noisy even when crowded so i guess the crowd are pretty refined albeit young they serve up yahava koffee here so fans of yahava koffeeworks can enjoy a nice cuppa here though they wont have the full yahava selection here i am really not a coffee person so am just happy to settle with a nice cup of fragrant chai latte didnt had too much time to try the mains but i managed to grab a bite of their plain pancakes it is a little pricey at  for  plain pancakes only at  or more you could try their banana pancakes or the tolido pancakes that comes with sausages the pancakes are soft and fluffy nice texture but still lacks a little bit of the richness compared to those that you will get at mcds they have breakfast all day menu and pasta mains simple cafe with a good variety staff are really friendly and nice would not hesitate to go back to try more food from their menu soon,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,i was staring greedily at the menu just  days ago when i was here and today i finally tried their spiced chai latte christmas special drink and waffles with rum raisin ice cream despite having an up sized bak chor mee dinner earlier we finished the waffle in record time freshly made piping hot waffles with rum raisin ice cream is heavenly a definite must try i am used to a much heavy taste of spiced chai latte so i was surprised that this was pretty light on the taste buds significantly missing was the taste of cinnamon which only came as an aftertaste that was barely there well the drink grows on you i guess as i felt quite satisfied after i finished my cup absolutely love the fact that its a closely knit family run business the cafe was empty save for the staff family at pm but started to fill up pretty quickly from pm onwards will be back again this weekend perhaps do not recommend this to your friends let is keep this a secret shall we,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,loved the coffee and brunch selection best beef bolognese and baked eggs best spiced chai latte ever i travel from orchard to here every weekend since i have discovered the place loved it,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,people are nice tap water is for free the cold low fat chocolate was great and the banana pan cakes i had were the best ever they just do not get full points because i were missing one savory vegeterian solution on the menue such as avocado smash,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,pro food is delicious french toast is amazing but to small more bacon ultimate combo is tasty and good amount of food con portion size between plates varies to much smoke salmon not worth the cost flavor is ok but nothing amazing service is terrible they bring u food but no utensils if u ask them for something do not expect them to remember seating is poorly done it is a mixture of first come first serve reservation and who ever tells the guy walking around where they want to sit,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,if your from the states like i am and looking to take a break from the local hawker stand and looking for alittle taste of back home this is definitely a place to check out the staff are awesome and they really make you feel at home definitely try the milk shake even for breakfast with the singapore heat wave this delectable frost of goodness just make the meal complete,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,oh yeah another hipster like coffee shop in sg exciting ehrm not so much ordered scrambled eggs with croissant and bacon eggs came in over buttered and nothing special no cheese in them or any other additional ingredient menu misses yoghurt or muesli for breakfast waited  mins for a coffee they forgot about our order it seems as if the place was ran by some young punks that lack order there is about  waiters they kept coming asking what we ordered not only is but the table next to us as well the coffee is actually good bitter than smooth but the fluffy milk balances out the flavours well inside is too crowded and small for my liking and disorganised especially at the entrance where water filler is placed and tables cannot get through i might be back but only because it is close to my house rating three only because of the coffee else this would get two p s for those that rated this  please go to ronin stay true to yelp,Negative
tolidos-espresso-nook,the go to place in singapore awesome food and coffee its a small place so if you have a big party better make a reservation you wo not regret it,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,of the hdb neighborhood cafes that i have visited tolido is espresso nook is one that left an impression a good one tucked in chaotic crawford lane among local coffee shops and singlet wearing ah peks and aunties hawking random stuff at void decks this cafe juxtaposes with a relaxed and chic vibe that would warrant a repeat visit i love the fluidity in the different spaces loosely separated by the low coffee bar and the floor to ceiling glass panes that act as invisible barriers to the alfresco area all day breakfast is served here for all you breakfast eaters pancakes eggs toast waffles and small pastries are available all day err day and there is no need to wait for the weekends i decided not to be greedy and went with the tolido is pancakes   which comes with  fluffy pancakes streaky bacon and egg sunnyside up typically the greedy me would have ordered the ultimate combo   which includes  chipolata sausages and more eggs on top of the basic pancakes but well it is quite a substantial portion already the pancakes while fluffy were still kinda moist and sticky inside a distinct milky flavor could be tasted and i liked that the batter was slightly salty i topped up  for scrambled eggs instead of a sunny side up the eggs had a nice height to it and was poofy like a cloud it could be a little more funny but it was still decent s had the waffle with ice cream   which came with a choice of a single scoop of ice cream sprinkled with freshly baked crumble and drizzled with your choice of sauce on a thick waffle if you like a crunchy waffles this would be up your alley but i thought it was a little more like a biscuit i e dry the generic but sufficiently rich chocolate ice cream helped to moisten the batter a little but did not make the dish spectacular if you want something more substantial tolido is also does pastas and sandwiches at reasonable prices   onwards i would love to try the croque monsieur only because i love the french ham and cheese sandwich now now tolido is also serves really good and pretty coffee yahava coffee blends are used here and the medium roast was fragrant and smooth with a low acidity head barista and owner douglas tan was the third place winner in the  singapore latte art competition and that explains the photogenic cuppas do not miss the salted caramel latte the flavor was well blended into the drink and every sip was a velvety mouthful with the perfect amount of salt yums adding to my list of favorites because of their salted caramel latte and lovely space,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,fine way to eat breakfast western style its really cheap in terms of singapore prices we eat some pancakes and scrambled eggs which were good,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,oh so delicious so glad we found this place with wonderful breakfast specials to go with their extraordinary brewed offerings would be very difficult to choose which dish i liked the most but i think i would go with the pandan pancakes which were perfectly prepared and the pandan adds a wonderful touch would not go to singapore without visiting this place,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,excellent food they understand what real western breakfast food is the maple syrup is potent the pancake is eggy and fluffy the coffee is good but a but sour it is a great place to get your early morning fuel,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,eating in tolido is is a great opportunity for people who love breakfast and pastas the food looks very presentable and the taste is oustandingly perfect if any of you are breakfast and pasta fans or even either one come to tolido,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,coffee is good nice atmosphere good food only accepts cash or nets so travellers beware reminds me of a typical melbourne australia cafe,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,glad i took the recommendation from them to try their pandan pancake and the waffles with egg bacon and scrambled egg was heavenly loved the scrambled egg especially,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,cheap and easy food was good and came quick if i am in the neighborhood i will definitely come back,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,love this place one of the few brunch places in singapore where you can get some decently priced grubs food is good too,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,best long black i have had in singapore thailand or malaysia was there for breakfast brunch pancakes and french toast were very tasty and well priced good atmosphere and a bit of a hipster fit out thats a positive has a bit of character,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,the coffee is good really good but under no circumstances is it appropriate to wait  minutes for a coffee we ordered received our food i went to the counter after  minutes to confirm they remembered our coffees food now finished someone comes over to confirm our coffee order and we repeat our order  more minutes we receive a coffee this place has great potential but great coffee without great service makes for an average experience,Positive
tolidos-espresso-nook,ice blended sea salt caramel latte was great but not so much when it is hot smoked salmon carbonara did not quite work the ultimate pancakes and bacon were good separately but as a whole the dish did not make an impression service is excellent staff were friendly and accommodating,Positive
jumbo-seafood,my boyfriend and i came here for dinner while in singapore and we were so happy we did we ordered chilli crab mantou buns and cereal prawns we loved everything and had a delicious meal we got the dungeness crab which i highly recommend because it had a ton of sweet crab meat it went really well with the chilli sauce you must also get the mantou buns to sop up some of the sauce they are deep fried slightly sweet bread rolls that are absolutely delicious i highly recommend getting both of these if you come here we had chilli crab at a hawker center and enjoyed it but preferred it with the dungeness crab we got here to the mud crab at the hawker center the cereal prawns were also delicious they come butterflied in a crispy cereal coating that has seasonings like chili and curry leaves in it they are fairly mild in flavor but were delicious i highly recommend also getting these service was not overly friendly but was fairly quick the place is definitely more expensive than a hawker center will be but not outrageously expensive i would recommend coming here if you are looking for good chilli crab in a higher end place,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i was recommended this restaurant by someone who grew up in singapore so i had to trust their recommendation i highly recommend purchasing the klook voucher before you come here as the food is quite expensive here i ordered a chilli crab and while it was absolutely delicious it would cost me about  sgd if i had not purchased the klook voucher i came here for lunch and since i was here on my own it took about  minutes to get a seat without a reservation they asked if i minded sharing a table with another party and i said no because i knew i would get seated sooner i was seated next to a girl about my age and her mother so it was all pleasant i ordered the smallest size chilli crab and used my hands to break into the crab along with the tools they provided to crack the shell i noticed some other people were provided with gloves and i think it is not fair that they did not even mention that they had gloves available maybe this would be something i would be aware of if i ate more messy seafood or if i were a singapore local big note they will offer you peanuts and tea as if they do not cost extra but they do so if you are trying to save some money refuse the peanuts and tea just get some water though that still costs extra regardless of choosing bottled or tap water another note they do not have napkins or anything at the table so if you need wet napkins definitely call someone over to provide you with some you will definitely need wet wipes because chilli crab gets messy anyway the chilli crab was very delicious i basically devoured the chilli sauce and the crab was yummy too the diy breaking into the crab was fun but super messy i would probably be happy with having any seafood with the chilli sauce but without the mess since i am just one person i was not able to try any of the other delicious items they have i hope i will be back here with some friends and try the cereal prawns,Positive
jumbo-seafood,sgd singapore dollar for some crab and fish seems like we were gettin played by our singaporean brothas and sistuhs but no we just had no idea what the hell we were ordering just look at the sgd gram and order the amount of grams u want to pay or that will satisfy ur belly do not order an entire fish crab if u do not want to spend close to  sgd i must admit the soon hock fish was phenomenal cooked to perfection in that wow i cannot believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce they do not make fish like this in the states the crab was delicious but ma pa makes me better crab so gotta knock off a star there was ample supply of crab meat the meat itself was sturdy full of flavor but we did not really enjoy the famous singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes if u do not want to smell like u have just rolled in some fine fish and crab u can wash ur hands at the sink inside the restaurant when u are all fished and crabbed out this is a seafood chain in singapore and unless u have dreamt of visiting singapore just to get a taste of the seafood here then just walk on by my friend cuz u can have the same quality tasting seafood for a better price point at one of the many food hawkers around town happy hawking,Negative
jumbo-seafood,holy cow totally wish we stuck with the street food and hawker stands waited all day to come try jumbo seafood for dinner and was so disappointed the whole dining experience was meh there was only one person taking orders you cannot just ask anyone to take your order or grab the server you would just get brushed off there were   of us dining  adults and a child we ordered the chili crab chinese broccoli small order of fried rice small order of noodles and  bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating nothing really wow ed us we were really underwhelmed especially for the price we paid honestly every hawker stand we tried the food was so good being that this was the most expensive meal of our trip we were slightly bitter and disappointed,Negative
jumbo-seafood,jumbo seafood is the place to go for crabs my parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in singapore with all the food choices that is a big endorsement unfortunately they were out of the alaskan crab the night that i went but we opted for dungeness crabs and they were still delicious everybody raves about the chili crab but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better but honestly you cannot go wrong with either choice the chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers the salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab the fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here sure it is a little pricey but it is well worth it you cannot come to singapore without stopping by a jumbo seafood location to grab some crabs,Positive
jumbo-seafood,during my  days stay in singapore in march of  i cannot not try the singapore award winning chilly crab here i was sooo excited to come and i have to say by far it is the best crab i have ever had in my life the sauce of the crab was soupy and you can dip with bread or donut i just ate it by itself and i finished the whole crab plus all the sauce did not waste any tiny bit well i did say it was the best crab of my life during the past  months i have tried a couple of malaysian and chinese restaurants in the northeast and have not found anything that was close to this i should have bought the chilly crab seasoning that the restaurant also sells my bf did not want to try any of my crab because he heard from many people who got sick with food in asia and he was extremely careful i did not care because i was born and raised in asia for  years before i came to the states he ordered a seafood clay pot instead which looked boring haha well that is his choice and nothing outside of the expectation but it is due to this disk that i am taking off a star he got very very sick after this disk i am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food but he started going to the bathroom twice before i even finished my meal omg poor guy we stayed at the marina bay and he almost did not make it back to the hotel that was his experience in asia did not get sick in a third world country vietnam eating all the street food but yet got sick in a restaurant in singapore and it was not cheap the bill came around  singapore dollars i know it was because of my chilly crab his disk was not that expensive i still love my chilly crab and want to come back to singapore for this but next time my bf for sure will just watch me eat,Negative
jumbo-seafood,a singapore institution that never disappoints situated on the shores of the river this beautiful setting in a warm singapore evening watching the people cruise by we started with a squid appetizer followed by pepper crab and chili crab crab comes with amazing sauce that cannot be described perfect little dough balls for mopping up the extra sauce love this place,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i am aware that jumbo seafood is a total tourist trap and that prices are high that said i was taken to a non touristy chilli crab spot by someone who lived in singapore previously and did not enjoy the crab at all since this was his first trip to singapore i figured why not go with jumbo i made a reservation for prime dinner time about  days in advance you do not need to book that far ahead but you do need to book early since it was only the two of us we did not want to order too many items we ended up getting chilli crab omg so good so messy so much fun we ate in silence as we concentrated on getting all the crab meat out i may have flung some crab onto the glass window next to where we were sitting oops fried buns perfect for soaking up the chilli sauce cereal prawns skip do not believe the hype it was not worth it we were in an out within an hour and were very satisfied with our seafood feast,Negative
jumbo-seafood,underwhelmed by the flavors and quality of the foods here we arrived here on a friday evening close to pm we only had to wait about  minutes for a table of  the restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside they provided waters and chairs for those waiting the restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to clarke quay center we were seated at a large table with other groups of  it took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders one of the customers had to flag the waiter down we were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional if we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts we ordered the chili crab and pepper crab along with fried rice and  buns i do not know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order  crab for just us  the foods came out very slowly and it did not make sense the ones who ordered last got their foods first it took about  more minutes until our foods came out the chili crab sauce was not good it had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell might have been overcooked the fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though the pepper crab came out way too late by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full we ate it anyways the flavors were odd i did not enjoy the flavors too much at the end of the dinner i felt nauseous and had to go back to hotel something about the flavors made me nauseous total came out around  usd expensive napkins were non existent we asked for some but were ignored,Negative
jumbo-seafood,someone at the hotelwhere i am staying recommended this restaurant after a walk in chinatown we decided to come here we got seated right away and we ordered the alaska king crab   kg half of the full crab about  sgd and we got the seafood noodles the sauce for the chili alaska king crab tasted like ketchup and was a little bit spicy not what i was expecting service was also very disappointing workers were rushing us to pay the bill even before we started to eat felt like we were been hustled peanuts that we did not ask for and was put in our table  sgd in the bill bread rolls that i did not even touch also put in the bill at least ask the guest if they want it instead of putting it on the table and charging for it i would not recommend this place way better other places in singapore to have chili crabs,Negative
jumbo-seafood,came for the chili crab and was not disappointed this stuff is so good and a cant miss in singapore i had found jumbo seafood on a list of best chili crab and had that recommendation seconded by a local so i could not say no one chili crab is about the right size for two people and do no miss the bao buns on the side to soak up all that delicious chili crab sauce also prepared go get messy digging in we had just a side of broccoli with the crab and honestly were so stuffed we did not need any other sides the wait was long but they take your name and number and clarke quay is a great place to walk around so just expect it to take a little time for your turn,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i really do not get the hype a single chili crab was  sgd which is about  for that kind of money i could go to an ayce buffet in vegas and get unlimited crab legs the flavor is pretty mediocre too we ordered pea sprouts but they were the baby kind not the tastier more mature kind and some sort of scallops in taro which i could have done without actually i could have done without the whole meal there are two branches of the same restaurant within walking distance of each other make sure you go to the right one reservations recommended this place gets busy,Negative
jumbo-seafood,a must visit for visitors to singapore jumbo seafood is the place to come for the classic singaporean dish of chili crab it is messy wear a bib it is spicy it is sweet it actually reminds me of the classic chinese tomato and egg dish perhaps not surprising since the sauce contains both these ingredients the cracked pieces of crab are delicious and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried crispy mantou on the side but chili crab is not the only thing to get here the vegetables stir fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness the seafood fried rice was a simple classic and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well but perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal when i saw this on the menu i thought that the cereal was just the breading for the shrimp but when the dish came i saw that the dish had way more cereal than shrimp luckily the crispy sweet cereal was an absolutely delicious part of the meal even eaten on its own,Positive
jumbo-seafood,salted egg coated food that is what this place is all about my colleagues and i came here for dinner none of us live here as it is super expensive to dine without expense account the crab was ginormous we ordered the set menu which is always the best  of us  a person totally worth it salted egg shrink and fish skin fried very singaporean and very cool salted egg coated crab and pepper crab two way delicious great view if you were to sit outside as it is right by the bay grab home as in using your grab app uber is no longer allowed since april in singapore or malaysia good riddance if you ask me and you should find a car sharing service nearby i do love me some singapore,Positive
jumbo-seafood,went here during a business trip had to stop by twice to try two different type of crabs black pepper and chilly sauce crabs we like the chilly one better,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crab is excellent their fried rice is one of the most well made fried rice i have ever had each grain is perfectly sauted and not overly saucily or oily,Positive
jumbo-seafood,everything about this place was great aside from the price chilli crab is expensive i get it but the quantity we got just was not the best for the price we paid other than that though now that that is out of the way the food was freaking delicious and the reservation system online was really easy and convenient to use the decor inside is very pleasant and comfortable and the servers were very helpful and polite which made the atmosphere and experience good for us also the salted egg golden prawns were an excellent appetizer along with the mantou bread to drench in our chilli crab sauce would still recommend coming to this place if you have never had chilli crab or are dying to get chilli crab but i wo not be back for a while after being underwhelmed by the quality value ratio of singapore is national dish,Positive
jumbo-seafood,alaays good expensive but always good the chili crab i have spent so much on those crabs,Positive
jumbo-seafood,really good seafood restaurant the price is fair for every bite of eaten you can feel yes the seafood worth the price,Positive
jumbo-seafood,kg for s  for non swim crab it is somewhat pricey and no service at all they told the customers pm last call for ordering and the restaurant close at pm a few tables came in around  pm they did not come to us to play the order when they finally do the dishes took sometimes to come then as you dig your hands into working on the crab the waitress came asking for payment on the total all of us must clean our hands and get the money or card to pay first before continuing eating this is for a pricy restaurant in the area and no customer service while they was not short hand at all then they force you to drop everything to make payment unbelievable and unacceptable,Negative
jumbo-seafood,three things my buds from the red dot said i must try tian tian hainanese chicken rice bah kuh teh and singapore chili crab i crossed the first two at various hawker centers around town for the chili crab many recommend me to come here arrived here via metro around  restaurant was at half capacity the lunch rush crowd gone and no reservation needed yes the food appetizer shrimp with pumpkin pure really good shrimp fried rice another great dish enough for  people main singapore chili crab excellent very flavorful spice level was just right enough kick to enjoy generous portion and good to the last bite environment service great the waiter was very attentive he also let me know i that i ordered enough for  people glad i stopped because i was about to order two more dishes love the bibs and large hand washing stations you do not have that same luxury the meal was worth the price glad i listened to my buds that pointed me this way,Positive
jumbo-seafood,not worth the hype crab was good but service was mediocre got in right away but we were there  mins before they opened they forgot two of our entrees we ordered very nice servers super crowded clearly a local and tourist favorite dinner and we still left a bit hungry good location close to marina bay and other restaurants if the wait gets too long,Negative
jumbo-seafood,a must try when you are in singapore so yum i am drooling now as i write this review i definitely recommend the chilli crab with lots of fried buns we ordered that along with some veggies and fried rice i would opt out of the fried rice and order extra buns instead the chilli sauce is scrumptious you would want to eat it all up we got lucky and were able to walk in without a reservation we sat outside while it was lightly drizzling but we were not uncomfortable at all the outdoor part of the restaurant had umbrellas to shield us from the rain and the waiters provided covers to protect our belongings,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the prawns with the pumpkin pure was hubby is fav thing to eat when we went to singapore this place is expensive but worth it to come once there is plenty of other cheaper and better eats the service was pretty attentive even though our chilli crab took forever it does not come either the bread which is pretty stingy considering the price of the crab over  usd i would come back with new people but not again on our own this is a tourist trap and the prices reflect this,Negative
jumbo-seafood,unfortunately my rating isnt about the food i never got a chance to try anything i have never felt so unwanted and disrespected in my life i took a solo trip to singapore and was really looking forward to trying food from jumbo especially after watching so many videos about it needless to say i should have payed attention to the fact only asians were on the videos i had a pm reservation not even  minutes after being seated i was being rushed to order i politely asked the waitress for a few minutes to look over the menu  minutes later a new waitress comes and ask for my order as i am trying to order my food she kept saying thats too much for you to everything i asked aee you speaking of the portions or the price i was well aware of what i would be spending i am not a budget traveler she did not answer and walked off i payed for my tea with another waitress and walked out,Negative
jumbo-seafood,if chili crab is something you must try when visiting singapore then jumbo seafood is one of the best places to try it yes it is a chain restaurant that is very pricey and very crowded requiring a reservation if you want to avoid a long wait in the unrelenting heat and if this is your first time trying chili crab it will invariably fall short of your lofty expectations but you should definitely still eat here when given the chance because despite all this the food is delicious i personally favored the black pepper crab which came smothered in a potent pepper sauce packed with a subtle kick although the chili crab was delicious as well sopping up all of the sweet and spicy chili sauce with the fried buns was a most satisfying experience the salted egg prawns were a pleasant surprise with the egg yolk providing a mild flavor and interesting texture while the sweet and crispy fried baby squid made for a perfect little appetizer despite being a bit of a novelty there is no doubt that jumbo seafood prepares some quality seafood and a mean version of chili crab if you are willing to deal with the steep prices they charge for everything including the peanuts and wipes the lackluster service and are lucky enough to score a reservation in the air conditioned section you will be treated to a very tasty meal,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i came here on a saturday night without a reservation and did not have to wait long it is located by the river walk and patronized by a lot of out of town visitors foodchili crab very good but extremely expensive i think we paid usd for  crab which is ridiculous but i can see why it is so popular the sauce is a delicious blend of sweet and spicy and perfect with rice or man tou buns on the side man tou yummy they are slightly sweet and slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside definitely recommend i just wish they were a little bigger because you can eat one in  bites noodles i do not remember the name on the menu but these noodles were super yummy they were nice and sweet and spicy and a decent amount for   people chinese broccoli this was just ok i am not a fan of chinese broccoli in general and thought this dish was a bit weird with the thousand year eggs and egg yolk servicethe servers are super busy here and we had to flag ours down multiple times they are very nice though and the food comes out fairly quickly considering the amount of people in the restaurant overallthe food was good but overall very pricey especially their famous chili crab but would i come here again yes because even though it is touristy the food is still good oh and that glass tray of yellow liquid on your table it is just tea with lemon to wash your fingers with after eating crab do not drink it you are welcome,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this place was recommended to my sister and i by someone to order the chili crab specifically during my trip chili crab was everywhere i do wish i had tried it elsewhere to give a comparison however i am not mad with only having eaten it here my sister and i got one crab to share which was more than enough it is truly the sauce that makes this dish so great i love tomatoes anything tomato based i am typically a fan right off the bat and their sauce has a tomato y base that is sweet and spicy and so addicting i would pour the sauce on anything and eat it that how good it is we also ordered the ho fun sadly i did not take a picture of it but is really good the gravy was very flavorful my sister and i love the chili crab sauce so much that we even ended up mixing it with our noodles finger licking bowl slurping good,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i love jumbo and the one in ion orchard is great servers here are ridiculously slow and system is so inefficient lets say if you order bun in big room someone bring buns and put on their common table then my server comes and serve them to customers so fucking ridiculous why not serve buns to me directly so my bun was there in front of me and i had to wait for fucking min to get this cold bun besides customers nearby me ordered bun and they forgot and asked them again like in min love dish but attitude and efficiency need to be improved here i wont come back and will keep going to the one in ion orchard,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this place is good if you are visiting the clarke quay boat quay area i cannot say it is the best chili crab because it is the first time having the establishment was very busy and the whole area is busy at night the chili crab had good taste and i recommend trying it if you are visiting after the first piece i said i am getting it again the next day but by the end of the meal i was satisfied,Positive
jumbo-seafood,my friend took me here for chili crab because it is the must do thing in singapore and this is a popular spot overlooking the water singapore river the ambiance was amazing the wait is super long so you definitely have time to grab a happy hour drink nearby you put your name in the queue and they will call you when your table is ready you can request your own table or a shared table which is probably quicker to get seated at they quoted us  minutes but we were seated in less then  now on to the food though we tried the chili crab my friend told me her favorite was the salt and pepper which i wish we got instead the chili crab is good but a bit too sweet for me it is basically doused in sweet chili sauce the kind you might dip your eggroll in i prefer my crab on the savory side we also got the fried rice loved it morning glory was to die for and their special bread was a must to dip in the crab sauce it seems almost impossible to have a bad meal in singapore so this is another good one i enjoyed myself and left with a food coma,Positive
jumbo-seafood,jumbo is a must go stop for me whenever i am back in singapore for vacation jumbo has numerous outlets across singapore and this review is for the riverwalk outlet their baby squid appetizer is a must have they are crunchy with the right amount of sweetness i had the herbal live prawns cereal prawns mocha ribs and many other dishes all were delicious service was great too as staff were very attentive however my dining experience was spoiled by a company having their staff dinner celebration they were obnoxious with their loud yum shengs throughout the duration i was there while i understand it is chinese new year i feel that party should have spared a thought for other diners in the restaurant maybe jumbo can advise big parties to be mindful with their noise level next time as this restaurant is rather small and any noise is amplified in this enclosed airconditioned area i talked to a service staff abt the noise disturbance and the management served my party with a complimentary dessert a nice gesture by the management of jumbo while i appreciate the nice gesture i would have preferred to enjoy my dinner without the noise disturbance i recommend this seafood restaurant and hopefully next time i will not be dining with large noisy groups,Positive
jumbo-seafood,their chili crab and walnut prawns are to die for a must try for anyone visiting singapore with an appetite for seafood the only thing that put me off was sitting next to an annoying party at the same table,Positive
jumbo-seafood,expensive but definitely lives up to it is reputation we ordered the chili crab cereal prawn fried prawn rolls scallop vermicelli extra fried buns stir fry vegetables and  desserts it was a lot for  people the cereal prawns were really crispy loved the cereal topping we devoured the entire dish right after it hit the table the prawn rolls were good as well definitely order more fried buns to soak up all that chili crab sauce or eat it with your rice,Positive
jumbo-seafood,very pricey place to have singaporean chili crab the waitress tried to upsell us to get both the large chili crab and black pepper crab i did not like that she tried to tell us that they were out of the small regular sized crab the large chili crab is like  or something anyways i got a small chili crab black pepper crab salted duck egg prawns and some fried mantou the chili crab and black pepper crab were both pretty delicious make sure you get the fried mantou to soak up the flavors,Negative
jumbo-seafood,great chili crab was in singapore for business and i craved this place everyday after my first try the young coconut was so sweet i had to get one to go the chili crab with the buns were out of this world i love them better than their competition the meal was not cheap by any means but i look forward to going back just to experience that meal again,Positive
jumbo-seafood,my husband and i ordered chili crab and egg fried rice the quantity was good more than enough for two both chili crab and fried was delicious,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this place was packed when we came fortunately they have a good digital line approach the ambience is nice because it is right on the water in the clarke quay area so there is lots of people watching and fun stuff to see in the surrounding area we ordered the chili crab and broccoli the sauce on the chili crab was great also the crab was fresh and delicious you can tell everything is made to order the broccoli was too oily for me but it was cooked to the right tenderness the service was fine fast and efficient but not very friendly bottom line come here for the ambience and the chili crab expect new york style service it is fast it is efficient but there is no relationship building prosclarke quay areaon the water fast service good digital line serviceconsservice could be much friendly,Positive
jumbo-seafood,amazing we ordered the award winning chili spice crab with  rolls the mee long i think that is the correct spelling if not the noodles on the recommendation menu page and the beef filet in pepper sauce for  people we could have done without the beef filet but it was still tasty the staff were amazing and guided us through our ordering we were originally going to choose  crabs because we thought it was not enough meat inside but there was plenty like  pieces each,Negative
jumbo-seafood,i highly recommend jumbo this particular location is excellent all around servicewhile you might expect the service at a chain restaurant to be sub par you would be wrong about that at this particular jumbo restaurant the service was notably great they were attentive efficient mindful of the number of guests in our party and quick to keep us updated on the status of our cooking crabs one manager even went out of his way to convince us not to order so much he saved us  and a night of misery that was very hospitable and ethical of him foodomg if crab was meant to be served and eaten by gods then there ought to be no other way to serve or eat crab than this the perfect balance of sweet tangy salty and spicy i do not know how else to describe the succulent taste that enraptures your taste buds we ordered both the chili crab and the blk pepper crab both excellent but above i am speaking of the chili crab environmentexcellent location the restaurant is always jamming but they do a good and efficient job of spacing everyone apart i highly recommend you making reservations if you are in singapore you will must try this joint,Positive
jumbo-seafood,when you visit singapore you have to have chili crab period coming here for a work trip i let my coworkers do the planning night one after arrival we found ourselves here there were  of us and i thought my male coworkers were joking when they said we were going to order  crabs at about  crab say what  but wanting to have the full experience i acquiesced the final menu for our table  crabs  chili  black pepper an order of the tiger prawns fresh steamed abalone fried rice bok choy because you need your greens the crabs were good but to be honest i enjoyed the black pepper crab better than the chili crab which was marinated in so much tomato sauce that it was actually quite difficult to eat the tiger prawns though this was worth it it was about  skewer of one prawn but it was one of the best prawns i have ever had the abalone was silky smooth the fried rice and bok choy were as good as fried rice and bok choy can be but nothing out of this world the total bill was a whopping sgd ouch but when in rome right i am glad we tried it but at these prices i am not so sure it was worth it i wish i had a point of comparison and should have tried it at other places but that will have to wait for the next trip i would definitely recommend a go at the abalone and for sure the prawns this is what upped it from a  to  star in my books p s i truly do appreciate they have a hand washing station a definitely must,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i had a reservation but i arrive to the restaurant one hour early and they were able to seat us outside right away they ran out of small crabs so my mom and i ordered medium to share the size of the crab was just right it gets really messy and i saw some local people bringing in their own plastic gloves and wipes how smart and professional you have to order the fried bread to dip in the chili sauce it is so heavenly i did not find the price is particularly expensive for the crab itself but i thought the side dishes and drinks are quite high stir fried spinach for  dollars umm i do not think so the customer service is just okay nothing special i wish they kept the bathroom clean because even the basin was really disgusting,Negative
jumbo-seafood,they got their sauce right thats the key though price is on high side per local is input who know where to go locally for their popular dish other than this place,Positive
jumbo-seafood,first foremost i do not know where one yelper really went this restaurant does not has a seating on a tarmac what we are not on the airport runway lol indoor seating with really good ac no visible bugs and plenty of soap towels for the patrons back to my review i love that the restaurant gives out bibs to the patrons the bibs are so cute had a reservation at noon today we ordered chili crab black pepper crab deep fried prawns in cereal and a dozen of buns chili crab definitely an a it was not too spicy and i really believe the chili crab here is better than those at no signboard at esplanade black pepper crab that is a b i have definitely had better black pepper crab elsewhere deep fried prawns in cereal a the small order has generous amount of prawns at  and came without the shells that was not bad at all this dish was good but those at no signboard at esplanade is slightly better fried buns a despite someone commenting i have become fatter eyes rolling just last week i have been indulging in fried food the buns here were golden and crispy on the outside and so soft in the inside this definitely complements the chili crab definitely order these buns to go with the chili crab service was top notch and the staffs took peanuts and tree nuts allergies very seriously so no chili crabs for those allergic to peanuts will definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to try out singapore is famous and very popular chili crab,Positive
jumbo-seafood,during our visit we swung by and tried the crabs like tourists do the service when in the restaurant was on par with a busy chinese restaurant what tainted our experience was the hostess at the other jumbo location on merchant road not sure where this review most appropriately fits being tourists our cab dropped us off at the merchant road location right in time for our reservation at the riverwalk once they let us know we were in the wrong spot we asked if they would let the other location know we were on our way the hostess said she would not having a toddler in tow did not elicit any sympathy from the hostess and she reminded us we had  minutes left to make our reservation before it was given away eventually the food was good i have never had chili crab and thought it was okay the fried buns are a bit greasy i would stick with the regular ones the food is pricey as expected i thought it was a good one time food experience i do not feel the need to go back and visit again,Negative
jumbo-seafood,jumbo seafood is definitely the best seafood restaurant to go to they have the best chilli crab in singapore the queue can be very long especially during the weekends,Positive
jumbo-seafood,we had to try the famous chili crab that singapore is known for so we went to probably the most well known place in the city country that is known for it keep in mind that there is one right across from clark quay that we got this location confused with so we ended up being slightly late for our lunch reservation here that said we were able to get a seat inside easily enough although by the time we had left the restaurant was quite packed for a weekday lunch service was pretty quick and easy although one of the menu items we wanted was not available despite it being early on in the day a bit puzzling but not a dealbreaker the drink selection has a lot of juices but the alcoholic selections beer and wine are a bit on the light side the crabs themselves they are huge but they are very tasty as well for someone who is a bit less experienced at pulling apart seafood i made an abject mess of it thankfully there are wet wipes and plenty of extra napkins provided but the meat was fresh and infused with the delicious fragrance and taste of red chilis one could be forgiven for thinking that the crabs were swimming in chili oil before being cooked be prepared to fight for the meat though it takes a lot of patience and you have to watch our for the sharper edges on the shell once your hands are slippery from the oil outside of that though the rest of the meal was very standard issue chinese food and given the premium the restaurant places on the crab everything else is pretty overpriced in comparison the fish maw soup i had here was definitely worse than i have had in china or in chinatown in nyc and it was quite a bit more expensive the mushroom tofu dish we got as our other side was similarly bland and uninspiring but it set us back nearly s  possibly more the crab lives up to the hype and i would come back just to eat that alone but the rest of the meal was overpriced mediocrity to put it bluntly unfortunately the magic that comes along with the crab is not really present on any of the other dishes,Negative
jumbo-seafood,awesome place ordered chili crab steam cod with mushroom sauce fish maw soup garlic pea sproutseverything was delicious and as advertised recommend,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i went early in the day right when they open so no reservations were necessary and everything here was in tip top shape from the staff to the food loved it all of course we had the chili crab but also the rack of lamb seafood fried rice veggies shark fin soup and basket of mini buns perfect amount of food for  people not sure how busy they get in the evening but worth the wait no need to go into depth about the food you can read the other reviews just know i cleaned the pan dry with that chili crab bombay behbeh,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i went for the chili crab which was tasty they brought it out for me to inspect and i did not even realize it was alive the rich sauce it came in when cooked was pretty unique and definitely tasty not punishingly hot but a bit of a creeping heat in a good way my host ordered many side dishes which were also delicious the atmosphere was nice too while it was a muggy singapore night after a small beer and the start of food i paid no mind,Positive
jumbo-seafood,got the chili crab here to see what the fuss was all about the food and service was okay and the chili crab was flavorful the cost for the crab was around  it was a good experience but not worth the price to try again also expect to wait  minutes or more around dinner time,Negative
jumbo-seafood,i made a reservation online a week before there is no specification of indoor or outdoor seatings when we arrived it was hot and humid we requested for indoor seats we were told that we have to wait and not given about the approximate time of wait after   mins went by we approached the hostess again and told the same thing so we asked to speak to the manager instead of accommodating and honoring our reservation he basically said that if we do not want the outdoor seating he cannot kick his indoor customers out we replied that it was not our intention to have him kick his customer out but we would like to be seated for next available table as we saw other people were being seated before us while we had the reservation it was definitely disappointing to speak to a manager who is more defending himself rather trying to accommodate his customers moving on to chili crabs it was delicious forgot which one we ordered but it is got eggs on its broth fresh and juicy i love the flavor and savoring the sauces w a bowl of rice we did not ask price as it is not indicated on the menu and we were aware it was by weight so we ordered one to share along w other dishes the razor clam was really delicious too overall i like the food although it is definitely overpriced especially the chili crab ours came out to be over  sd for one small crab as some of the yelpers mentioned there were also shady about the price and yes they charged petty things like napkins tea and peanuts i would probably not want to return w such terrible manager and steep touristy price,Negative
jumbo-seafood,tourist chain i am sure but really i am only here to get my chili crab fix and theirs did not dissapoint it was delicious flavorful huge crabs i heard it is a pretty expensive place so keep that in mind we also got the fried rice which is fabulous with the chili crab sauce some fish and chinese brocolli try it if you are strolling down clark quey,Positive
jumbo-seafood,great food good riverside tourist location horrible service the food really is worth visiting here i have been twice and will go back despite the dismissive and unwelcoming staff they are not helpful if you have questions and expect you to order as soon as you sit down they also timebox reservations so if you take too long to eat or just linger you will be asked to leave tip there is a wash station by the bathroom that you should use several times during the meal as it can get very messy also do not wear a white shirt they charge for the peanuts and tea so tell them no if you do not really want them chili crab very good must getblack pepper crab good not great also found it to be spicier than the chili crab fried prawns with cereal did not enjoy it is very sweetregular prawns very goodwhole fried fish cannot remember the name but was pictured in the menu very,Positive
jumbo-seafood,worth the wait we were told to skip the chili crab and do black pepper but once we got there how could we pass up our opportunity my husband and i are not the most savvy of chili crab jumbo seafood orders so we went for the meal for  option a and let them bring stuff out the greens crab seafood rice and yummy rolls were all amazing the desert was a nice surprise too really great tasty experience and glad we tried the chili crab we put the sauce on everything,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i cannot say enough great things about the amazing crab dishes we had here we went after getting repeated recommendation vouches for the jumbo seafood as the go to place to try singaporean chili crab even though at first we were hesitant due to the fact that it was a chain joint however despite a bit of difficulty getting reservation we used the app chope and slowness in service i have to say the food itself was amazing for the two of us we ordered  veggie dish sauted in garlic sauce and one chili crab and they were both a pure delicacy we got medium spiciness and was just perfectly sauced spiced cooked steamed and cracked to be eaten easily what a joy we then proceeded to order a pepper crab which was warmed in delicious butter and exotic black pepper and it was like experiencing a whole new world a world is apart journey in flavor from the chili crab yum i would recommend both since they are very different but if i had to choose one would probably go with the classic chili crab also beware that the crabs are not cheap about  sgd a piece so be prepared to spend some if you are willing to adventure on trying both next time i definitely want to try their buns to dip it in the chili sauce as well as the fried rice also i would highly recommend this location located by the beautifully lit singapore river as it is only a short walk to all the beautiful sights and sceneries by the water as well as the fullerton hotels and the merlion,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crab and black pepper crab with fried rice was yummy it is near by the river but long wait even i made a reservation not worth the wait i think many other dishes to try but didnt have a chance to do so,Negative
jumbo-seafood,there is a reason people put up with the difficulty of making a reservation and the wait for your table even when you do have a rez and the reason is quality and enjoyment derived from the food atmosphere eh there is nothing there service a little better maybe but crab now we are talking my wife and i shared  chili crab standard size is   kg at   black pepper crab standard size is  kg also  a couple orders of their mini buns  buns for   do not order more than one per plate as you can use a spoon to eat the sauce no bread less filling oh yes we also ordered a side of stir fried broccoli  which was more wok steamed and very delicious with garlic several beers each burp as other advised we told staff to remove peanuts and yet we were still charged for the ice tea that we never order they promptly took it off the bill when i said something all in all as others have stated great succulent sweet crabs order all your food as soon as you sit down as your    hour dining clock starts then they will get pushy as it nears your expiration if they ran the parking meters we would all get tickets,Positive
jumbo-seafood,people kept mentioning the chili crab at jumbo so i had to give it a try there are few locations throughout the city but we heard the riverwalk location was great and so that is where we went i recommend sitting outside so you have a view of the water my two friends and i shared a chili crab sgd pepper crab  sgd small fried rice enough for  or  ppl broccoli and the fried buns i loved every bite of everything the sauce for the chili crab was great for dipping the fried bun eating the crab involved some work so do not try to be dainty while getting into it they give each guest a little bowl of water for washing so that comes in handy minor thing to call out they put peanuts on the table for snacking before the meal comes out you think it is free but there is a small charge i have also heard they sometimes charge for the napkins which you will need so ask before taking a big stack overall this place is slightly price given it is a chain restaurant but it was a good meal make sure to call for a reservation we had a pm rez and had until   to finish i did not feel rushed but i am sure they would have notified us had we overstayed out time there is another location just a short walk on the clarke quay riverside walk so make sure to go to the right location,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this was a serious disappointment for me definitely recommend making rezzies bc the wait can be very long i was looking forward to trying the chili crab but price to taste ratio was not worth it in my opinion almost usd for one crab drenched in s tomato chili sauce with scrambled egg the garlic butter crabs in san francisco were much better and half the price for sides we had greens at almost  usd and the portion was tiiiiny do not accept the peanuts they try to give you when you first sit down they will charge you you are given one measly towellete to use how is this possible when you have to dig in with your hands i guess you are paying for the view and location we were a party of  and asked to sit at a table closer to the water but was told it was only for parties of  or more yet as we were leaving i noticed a caucasian party of two sitting at the table i asked for definitely never coming back there are a lot more seafood options in the city,Negative
jumbo-seafood,staff was very helpful since it was my first time hear had the chili crab and it was great highly recommended,Positive
jumbo-seafood,nom nom nom needless to say love to come back i had three plates service was efficient good servings value for money two of us think you should get the restaurant is signature bowl chilli crab,Positive
jumbo-seafood,like all the other yelpers are saying chili crab that would be what you have to get here i do not care if that is the only thing you get as long as you get chili crab the bread rolls that can be dipped into the delicious sauce this joint is probably most frequented by tourists cough me cough my cousins took me and my grandma here while we were visiting them because they were famous for their chili crab apparently even won awards as they should although i did not get to try pepper crab their salted egg crab was also delicious as well it is damn messy so take your foodporn pictures before digging in because you will need to spend some time apart from your precious phone to enjoy this singaporean delicacy tip the crab meat itself might taste kind of bland because it is protected from communication with the chili sauce by that damn shell so tip the meat into the sauce for a better tasting experience you can sit outside or inside the inside has ac so for all you people who do not like sweating while eating be sure to make a reservation for a table indoors otherwise prepare to get a workout in while eating crab in that humid singapore weather all in all i want to come back here the next time i am back in the country,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the food here was really nice the seafood is fresh and prices are decent however the waiter that served us who ridiculously careless forgot to take in our order and also did not apologise overall despite for the service quality the experiences is pretty nice,Positive
jumbo-seafood,when in singapore it seems chili crab is a must try so my sister and i trekked over to this location before our flight luckily for us there was no wait i think we arrived right before the lunch crowds poured in it got really busy as we were eating the chili crab was something we definitely had to get but my sister also wanted to try the cereal prawns i noticed the menu had a prix fixe for two people  sgd which included a variety of items although the price tag was steep who knew when we would be back in singapore we took the plunge and i would say i am pretty happy with our decision we were able to try a variety of items including lychee soda dragonfruit lobster salad fried rice with egg cereal prawns chili crab and a pomelo sago dessert i loved the lychee soda refreshing and not too sweet my least favorite item was actually the dragonfruit lobster salad it was literally just chopped dragonfruit mixed with lobster and mayo the fried rice with egg was pretty good and came in a huge portion i think this could have been enough for  people the star of the show the chili crab was delicious the crab meat was juicy and flavorful the sauce was not as spicy as i thought it would be in fact it was pretty sweet however it was still really good and tasted fantastic when you dipped the fried mantou in the sauce i also enjoyed the cereal prawns which literally tasted like shrimp covered in crushed cereal sounds weird but it was yummy we ended our meal with a spectacular dessert of pomelo and sago i would give jumbo seafood five stars if not for the spotty service the girl working the front seemed really frustrated and was not very welcoming the waitstaff inside were very nice and friendly but service was very slow,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this was my only chili crab experience and i sort wished i ate it again the two of us shared the chili crab with the fried buns we did not eat any rice just fried buns we used the buns to soak up all the chili sauce that was the absolutely best part they do charge you for the peanuts and the tea it is kind of annoying because we did not asked for neither but oh well the meal was still pretty great,Negative
jumbo-seafood,delightful chili crab omg creamy delicious tofu loved the sauted baby kale and prawn tempura would go back for this experience great service and friendly staff,Positive
jumbo-seafood,we love both chili crab and black pepper crab however i personally think they are pricey next time i rather try somewhere else if i am craving for chili and black pepper crab service,Positive
jumbo-seafood,be prepared to shell ha out a lot of money for the meal here but it is totally worth it considered by most people i have talked to as one of the top two or three crab restaurants in sg which is world famous for crab and i understand why the crabs are huge we had one chili crab and one pepper crab for five people soooo good also some fried noodles spinach with garlic prawns with some kind of sweet dry crust on them wish i could remember the name and of course buns to soak up the sauces plenty of pitchers of cold tiger beer to round out the meal reservations are highly recommended as it is crowded every night on the border of clarke quay and boat quay with both indoor and outdoor seating service is efficient lots of people refilling glasses getting more beer not overly friendly but that is not really an issue you will be too busy chowing down to care highly recommended,Positive
jumbo-seafood,so i was here in aug  for a family vaca and i was really expecting the food in singapore to really blow me away i felt food in singapore was good at best jumbo was a shining star though there are two locations on clarke quay pronounced clark key very close to each other since they are both very busy catering to the hungry tourist i actually found this place from the hotel i was staying in the place is definitely a great choice but it is pricey the food roast duck with mango this was the only dish i was not completely in love with it was a good dish but the combination of mango and duck was off for me yelp com userlocalphot boiled shrimp in a sweet and sour sauce with a side of jellyfish i thought this dish really worked the shrimp was cooked nicely and the sweet and sour sauce paired nicely with the shrimp the jellyfish does not explode with flavor but was a nice contrast in taste and texture to the shrimp yelp com userlocalphot broiled jumbo prawn with japanese mayonnaise so utterly amazing it was so perfectly cooked the prawn and mayo was perfection yelp com userlocalphot singapore chili crab this is singapore is signature dish it was excellent the chili sauce is sweet and slightly spicy the crab they used was dungeness crab and we ordered mantou buns to sop up all the sauce this dish is so messy but completely worth the mess it is a must get in singapore yelp com userlocalphot,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i wish i could fill a bathtub of the sauce they use on the chili crab and have my wife give birth to our first born son in it ok that maybe a bit much but that is how i felt when i tasted that crab for the first time last night i would recommend getting a side of white rice to put the leftover sauce from the crab on also got the veal which was solid but nothing so outstanding i have not had at other places do not really think it warranted the  price tag aside from the food environment was pretty nice and obviously in the very popular river walk area it was pretty lit on a friday night recommend this spot for people visiting or for a special date that you met somewhere other than tinder,Negative
jumbo-seafood,the best advice is not what to order here it is to avoid the lines somehow the first location had too long of a wait and sent us to the second location where the wait was a measly  minutes when we finally got a seat we ordered the benchmark chili crab kang kong sambal and scallops in purple yam we also ordered the lychee italian soda and the green apple italian soda the drinks looked pretty and tasted much better than imagined i was not drink that night but damn a beer would have gone so well with that crab the crab is swimming in sauce that is pretty damn close to perfection i wish i had just some plain white rice and could have engorged in that stuff alone the crab was fresh and good the kang kong was our way of trying to justify eating an entire crab and the scallops were just as good second piece of advice the scallops with the crab sauce is a large improvement over the house sauce the bill was a bit high but not unexpected for an entire crab would eat again with more folks to feel less guilty,Positive
jumbo-seafood,it is said that jumbo and no signal are the two best seafood restaurants in sg had no signal before so we tried jumbo this time actually the same taste i will recommend chilli crab over pepper crab with chilli sauce i can eat  fried bread,Positive
jumbo-seafood,came here twice during my visit of sg the primary focus is crab crab and crabs here dishes are pricey in this restaurant and i would suggest just get the crab out of here and go some where else if you are not filling singapore is full of delicious food everywhere i tried their chili crab black pepper crab in different session both are nice chili crab comes with a lot of sauce that is good with a bowl of white rice the black pepper crab is my favorite it is dry compare to the chili crab there is no sauce but it is more intense and flavorful to me it is about sgd crab after tax for the smallest size you can pick i ordered some other rice dish and vegetable dish because some of my family dont eat seafood the dishes were ok but definitely not worth the price again come here for the crab and you will not be disappointed tips line queue might be long so try to make reservation before you come,Positive
jumbo-seafood,overpriced and def a tourist trap portions are tiny for the price they charge beware of the peanuts and wet towels they put on your table it is not free they charge you for it so if you do not want to be nickel and dimed just politely say no and refused the nuts and whatever they put on your table without you asking the duck and mango salad was good,Negative
jumbo-seafood,i only had the chili crab and a bowl of rice and it was quite good it was spicier than i thought the price when i went was  per kilo and the crab i received which seemed typical was just shy of a kilo pricey this location is a little less busy than the one further down the river for some reason service was efficient but impersonal,Negative
jumbo-seafood,this place is off the hook love love their chili crab black pepper crab so good that we have to stop by again the next day just to make sure we tried everything food starsservice stars,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crab for the win i went to visit  friends in singapore and they took me here to try the famous chili crab omg it is messy but so yummy the sauce is great to mix with rice but seriously singaporeans where are the napkins,Positive
jumbo-seafood,food was delicious but the wait was awful  minutes luckily they have an efficient reservation system and even luckier i was with a local who knew what to do once we were seated everything was fine staff was friendly and helpful food came quickly and at a great pace ambiance was loud and crowded but somewhat expected for how popular they are,Positive
jumbo-seafood,a favorite with the locals and many tourists not a favorite for me and my family very oily and fatty food and it is difficult to eat crab with aquariums full of them lining the walls,Positive
jumbo-seafood,it is a tourist style restaurant but maintain very good quality even i lived in singapore would still like to visit again and again famous tourism restaurant can still provide very nice chili crab which is my favorite one in sg not too sweet and perfect match with fried mento and i love black pepper crab as well,Positive
jumbo-seafood,came here during a two week trip to singapore upon recommendations that i must try the chili crab during my visit jumbo is was recommended as a typical place people go and was convenient from my hotel i was told i must make a reservation and was glad for the advice when i realized i could not get in for a couple days this location was less busy than the one just up the river at riverside overall my experience was just ok the service was a little weird as they kept trying to deliver things i had not ordered and after accepting one of the items realized at the end that they just charge you for it i guess its like up selling i told them i did not want the tea or peanuts and noticed on my bill they removed these items so they were going to charge me i was also by myself and was brought a rather large crab  i probably should have requested something smaller but did not think that was the way they worked here the chili crab was ok but i wo not go out of my way to try again i would say this is a great place to try chili or pepper crab if you are visiting but once is enough,Negative
jumbo-seafood,my cousins would always rave about this place sending me pictures and then facetiming me when they were there so understandably expectations were high when i finally was able to make a trip to singapore needless to say expectations were met and then some the queue was short on the saturday night in january that we went party of three the night was warm and there was a cool breeze off of the river people were starting to gather at the lively clark quay area and only made the anticipation of my meal greater once seated we ordered the black pepper crab chili crab cereal prawns scallops in yam rings and then load of fried and steamed buns for three people it looked like a lot of food and it was but i could not stop eating the flavors were not too spicy not too sweet not too salty nice and balanced when you want to keep eating beyond the point of feeling full that usually is a good indicator of an amazing food experience,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this place is extremely shady my friend and i came here to try their crab around  pm our waitress told us they only have one last alaskan king crab left that would cost about  our first reaction was holy we even asked her if she was sure if that was the only type of crab left and if we could get any other type of smaller crab but she promised us that it was the last one and even spoke to the back with her transponder to save the last crab for me she even promised us that it would not be too much for  people i thought it was weird that this place would run out of its signature dish so quick but since i am only here for  days i decided to get it then as more customers came and ordered smaller crabs we called her over to question her and she denied everything and saying she only said that was the last alaskan crab now i would forgive her if we did not ask her  times to make sure that was the last of any crab and if she did not quote save the last crab for me they also charge everything from peanuts to water and they wo not tell you unless you ask so definitely watch out for that since they bring out the peanut to you without you asking for it like it was free,Negative
jumbo-seafood,i find myself salivating for more when i think about this jumbo seafood it is marvelous i cannot wait to go and try some more dishes here bye,Positive
jumbo-seafood,my first chili crab experience in singapore would be special no matter what but a friend strongly suggested it be here he recommended a reservation but when i happened upon this location right around dinner time with no plan i was able to walk right in they did put a  min time limit on my meal which was a first but something i actually found very efficient service was excellent i received constant attention i am still getting used to the lack of napkins in singapore so that was an adjustment bibb plastic gloves finger bowls and wet wipes but no napkins for a very messy meal with nothing to compare it to the crab was just ok i enjoyed it but it did not blow my mind and leave me salivating to return though perhaps chili crab in general just is not tasty enough for me to yearn for it especially at the price which was very comparative for chili crab in singapore glad i had the experience but i am not rushing back,Negative
jumbo-seafood,it is all about the crabs the chili crabs specifically this is the go to place for the extended family especially when relatives are here from overseas somehow there is something about eating crabs which brings the family closer maybe it is the mess where everyone just digs in using our hands and fingers trying to pry the sweet meat from the shells bibs are now provided so you do not get gravy stains on your tops the must order dish is the chili crab plus the fried mini buns mantous to soak up the addictive spicy sweet chili gravy the rest is an afterthought the food is generally decent but for the fried rice and hor fun they lacked the wok hei flavor of tze char sambal kang kong fried tofu cereal prawns and the likes are just ok or average the service is fast and there are two seatings the first is from  pm to  pm and with the speedy way they served the dishes our two tables were done within  minutes lots of eating and less talking i guess getting to the place is a bit of a hassle if you have elderly or those who cannot walk well in your dining party as they are plenty of steps to navigate parking is available at the riverwalk turn into upper circular road or at the ura parking lot behind i much prefer dempsey location which is equally crowded,Positive
jumbo-seafood,if i could fly the  hours from the us just to get chilli or black pepper crab i would it was that good i love spicy and both dishes were spicy but not too spicy we sat at a table with about  other people enjoying the good food i do not even know if a table for two was even an option and i did not care were i sat as long as the food was on the way not too sure how much everything cost since my dear friend from high school paid for everything,Negative
jumbo-seafood,one of the  things people said to do while in singapore was chili crab we needed to find the best place to test to have a thorough opinion so we poked the brains of every uber taxi driver and local we could find we found out everyone has a different opinion so since we wanted to go to clark quey we decided on the jumbo at the end so we could walk through the madness afterwards we ordered the chili crab malay style noodles and the little bread balls before i state my opinion i have to say that i am a big fan of crab i love than long ppq crawstation and at most places i can eat the shells clean and usually want to take a straw to the leftover broth but i was not tempted to ask for a straw here we were slightly disappointed in the flavor that was so hyped up by our friend the malay noodles on the other hand omg must get the flavor was beautiful the little bread balls were nice to not necessarily necessary but good for soaking up said chili sauce which is not the same as sipping the broth the bread just needed something this location is pretty sweet and we did not have to wait in line you might need to sit with other people at a large round table but it is a cool experience and you can see what other people order the group to the right of us ordered the king crab legs and the servers brought out the giant crab alive in a basket so he could meet the people that held his fate in their stomachs before being whisked away to the hot tub i would go back and maybe try chili crab at another place maybe,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i was very disappointed with nearly every aspect of this place let is chat about the basics  it was outdoors on tarmac exposed to bugs and whatever blew by  the washrooms had no soap nor dryer or towelling this washroom was used by the staff who prepared and delivered food to tables as well as patrons any place in where there is no proper hand washing facilities concerns me greatly this last fact should close them down for sanitation review the photos of the food on the menu did not match what arrived in several cases the low quantity and low quality of the food for the high price charged was simply outrageous they seemed more interested in upselling alcohol than serving food once they knew you were not going to be drinkers the wait staff ignored us for quite a while before coming back to place our order when the food was ready it was rushed to the table in an effort to turn the table as soon as possible they charged   for a single chopped up crab a k a crab bits was more than a bit pricey for what you got for   you get a  cm cube of codfish six tiny scallops surrounded by an enormous amount of yam cost  again not worth the price and they tasted oily maybe they were good at one time that is not the case any more at least not tonight and for a bill over   you would expect that you would get quality service and quality food with a hand wash facility for patrons and staff that had the basic necessities all in all i have nothing positive to say about this place and need to simply state that this seems to be an expensive low quality tourist trap for those that do not know any better avoid at all costs and seek singapore chilli crab elsewhere ask a local we will never return,Negative
jumbo-seafood,this place is the holiest of holy sites in singapore when it comes to seafood if you want ridiculously tasty chili and or black pepper crabs this is the place to go especially if you only have time to visit one particular seafood restaurant in singapore if you go with the chili crab make sure to get the fried mantou so you can dip it in the oh so delicious sauce if you go with the black pepper crab you will be happy as well so long as you do not mind looking absolutely disgusting after you finish you meal good thing they have huge sinks here for you to wash your face and hands there is plenty of other dishes that should be on your list such as the incredibly tasty steamed fish drunken prawns even the salted fish fried rice is a must try their mango desserts are also excellent and remember to wash it all down with a nice big ol coconut juice but there are some things to note as well  the peanuts here are not free there are still plenty of instances of nickel and diming bullshit in singapore and this is an example of it be sure to tell them right off the bat you do not want the peanuts and that you do not want to be charged for it  same deal with the tea that shit ai not free if you do not want to pay tell them ask for water instead  also remember the crabs are charged by weight make sure you ask for the size of your crab and the cost per kilo before you order otherwise you might get stuck with a  dollar order of crab and not realize it another weird thing i noticed on my most recent visit i ate here three times and on all three occasions nobody ever bothered to return my change i had to bitch and moan each time to get my money back what gives btw they do include a service charge in the meals fyi,Positive
jumbo-seafood,we were so lucky that our uber driver knew the people that own this place we got reservations on a weekend night and sat outside unfortunately it was so hot and humid and mosquitoes love me but the food was well worth it the chili crab is so worth it they are huge and scrumptious and yummy deep friend prawns in cereal are also a must if you come here for just those two things it is so worth it,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this was my favorite restaurant on my singapore trip and had the most memorable meal here this restaurant is by the riverside and the view is simply breathtaking my best friend who lives in singapore took me to this place on my recent visit knowing my love for crabs she recommended getting the chili crab and it was delicious we also got some shrimps with garlic and it was so yummy the bread that they give is so soft and almost taste like donut without the sugar i had a great time here and i owe it all to my friend who helped me pick the right things,Positive
jumbo-seafood,one of the messiest dinners ever but so so worth it that tomato based yummy spicy broth the crab is in gets tastier as you sop up some mini buns with it pricey yep a must do and unique taste in singapore for sure,Positive
jumbo-seafood,a effn mazing got to try the infamous singapore spicy chili crab crowded and requires reservations it gets busy service not all the greatest a true singaporean style service get you in and get you out pronto they also give you a time limit to eat talk about speed eatingthe delicious damage see my photo spicy chili crab of course scallop yam ring i liked it salted egg prawns i liked it saucy and little salty mongolian beef good but nothing special chicken skewers again good but nothing special crispy pork belly holy shit goodness a must have do not take the service personal its just how the restaurant operates a must have meal when in singapore enjoy,Positive
jumbo-seafood,famous for its chili crab i naturally had to check it out while in town for business unfortunately while the flavor of the dish was pretty good it certainly did not merit the market price that i paid  it is a fun dish to eat at first complete with wet napkins and a bib but quickly becomes cumbersome and an act of patience service was surprisingly spotty during a slow time and my table had the luck of being seated directly beneath a tree shortly after it had rained so my food and self were frequently drizzled on from above you would think it would add to the scenery but that turns out to be a romanticized abstraction when spending this much,Negative
jumbo-seafood,we tried chili crab and peppercorn crab and ordered two side white rices the crabs were  each but is big and very meaty we sat outside on a beautiful night with the water as the backdrop,Positive
jumbo-seafood,if i could give this place negative stars i would although i use yelp regularly i never write reviews but this one place was so unbelievably bad i felt compelled to write my first review on the one positive side the seating process is efficient given that the place is run like a factory on a busy friday night i was seated within  minutes but sadly this is the only positive thing about the restaurant the service was appalling i was the only one at the table who did not have a place setting and i asked  times before i got one the waitress kept mumbling under her nose i noticed that none of the dishes on the menu had prices i ordered one chili crab and a glass of wine the waitress also brought peanuts and tea i did not love the crab but felt good about having tried it as the typical local dish then the bill came it was over  the crab was  which i thought was ridiculously overpriced i was also charged for the peanuts and tea i did not order and also did not touch i was appalled the entire experience was very unpleasant and left a bad taste in my mouth i recommend you avoid this restaurant,Negative
jumbo-seafood,heard that jumbo seafood was the one of the best places to go for chili crab in singapore the chili crab here was good but the price is way too high also they charge separately for anything to accompany the chili crab even rice or bread service was also some what inattentive which was surprising for singapore,Negative
jumbo-seafood,singapore chilie crab at its best amazing flavour and the perfect mix of spices the cereal prawn is a must try the service and the ambiance is very nice we did not have to wait for too long even if you have to wait a bit it is worth the wait highly recommend it this will be a place of indulgence during every visit,Positive
jumbo-seafood,struggling whether to give it  stars or  stars but jumbo seafood is really not as bad as many make it out to be sure the price is expensive and the wait here can be daunting but with a little bit of planning ahead and an expectation to spend   per crab this place is quite all right the chili crabs are delicious as judged by me a possibly misguided foreigner and the wait can be spent at one of the many bars nearby as they send a text message when the table is ready and wait   mins for you to arrive if you ask for it as for the price it is a meal for an occasion or when hosting visitors anyways and given the location near the circular road this place is worth it,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this place is really busy and best known for chili crab black pepper crab cereal pawnas there was only  of us and only  of us were eating the crab we had ordered  chili crab and a small cereal pawn the cereal pawn is sweet and quite tasty when ordering they will ask you with shell or no shell we went with the no shell one and felt that we made the right decision as the pawns are coated with the cereal the crab was more than enough for two people it comes with so much sauce that you should order rice to eat up some of the sauce as we were sitting outside we also ordered a jug of lime aloe juice to share everything was really good just be careful of the service they will charge for everything when we got our bill we noticed that we were charged for the peanuts that were given to us the tea they poured us  service charge,Positive
jumbo-seafood,extremely deceptive the guy who took our order tried convincing us to get a more expensive kind of crab they also gave us tea without asking what we wanted to drink and then charging us for the tea the service was horrible workers there walked around like zombies we did not have reservations and got seated outside there were a million little flies flying around landing on our food the chili crab was nothing to rave about i would not go back and honestly do not know what the hype is about,Negative
jumbo-seafood,if you are in singapore you have probably heard that you need to try the chili crab i will admit i am glad i did it was delicious although i think i would have preferred the black pepper crab instead but you get a yummy sauce for some bread with the chili option so depends if you are in a dippin mood or not i gave it  stars mostly because the service was very very average everyone around us seemed to be taken care of while we felt ignored for  of our meal i realize the service standard is completely different in the us of a compared to many parts of the world but it was enough to make us leave in a hurry if you are just looking for some good food and do not mind fighting a bit to get drinks or napkins it gets extremely messy as you can imagine then i think jumbos is worth a visit,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the chilli crab is so big it looked like it came from the wrath of the titans release the kraken overall this place was amazing ordered fried rice drunken shrimp and mantau on the sides the chilli crab sauce is superbly delicious they said that the crab are sri lankan the claws are as big as lobster tails make sure that you make reservations before coming in it is very crowded during dinner time beware hungry patrons lining up,Positive
jumbo-seafood,jumbo is a must everytime i am in singapore the chili crab is just delicious and something we westerners are not used to make sure to order minimum two mantous fried buns per person,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this place was highly recommended on my trip to singapore so i decided to try it we made reservations and upon arriving we was seated in about mins the service was very different as the waiter would bring things out to our table that we did not order after i asked him he said they are not complimentary and we had to pay for it so i kindly asked him to remove it from our table as i was not about to pay for something i did not order the food was good definitely order the black pepper crab if you like spicy food it was sooooo tasty and full of flavor the drinks was ok nothing special and the portion of the fried rice was a lot we also enjoyed the free wifi,Negative
jumbo-seafood,well folks this former new yorker is now officially singaporean from what i understand jumbo seafood is an establishment here in singers and i am happy to say that i enjoyed chilli crab pepper crab and drunken shrimp here my husband and i came by with some fellow ex pat friends who were visiting from kuala lumpur even with a reservation on a weeknight we had to wait another  minutes for a table but once we sat down it did not take long for them to take our order and deliver our starters the drunken shrimp tasted exactly like i thought it would in a flavorful broth with a hint of liquor the pepper crab tasted like pepper crab should i am always amazed at how they can get the meat to taste all peppery even though the crab shell is tough to break through and of course the granddaddy of them all chilli crab i liked this version a lot because it did have a little kick to it but not to the point where i was sweating balls the service was good even though the restaurant was fully booked i also found it kid friendly as our table did have a toddler there were other smaller kids at the tables nearby us and none of the other diners seemed to mind perhaps it is because we are all wearing bibs given how messy crab can get so we all look like children anyway overall a solid place to bring tourists or just your local selves to experience singaporean realness just remember that this location is not to be mistaken for riverside point which is located in the heart of clarke quay i made that mistake while reserving since this location is called the riverwalk but no worries as they are only about a   minute walk apart,Positive
jumbo-seafood,during my week long stay in singapore we came here twice i had to have more chili crab before i went home to texas service both times was excellent now to the important stuff the food the chili crab is by far the best thing on the menu the shells on those crabs are so thick you almost need a small hammer in addition to the cracker the little fried buns they give you are great to soak up the sauce the crab if floating in the pepper crab was okay peppery totally outdone by the chili crab the egg custard shrimp were delicious the whole peking duck was wonderful they prepare the whole thing bring it table side and then skin it in front of you wrapping the bits of crispy skin into crepes with cucumber green onion and a bit of sauce yummy then take the duck back and roast it again and bring it to you de boned and sliced the seafood fried rice was a bit on the salty side the venison was very tender not gamey at all and almost buttery both dining experiences were great and i would say this is a must go local or tourist,Positive
jumbo-seafood,incredible food got their signature chili crab salted eggshrimp fried buns and stir fried veggies definitely recommend for any visitors looking to try out the iconic singaporean dish wait wasnt that bad either   mins as expected for dinner,Positive
jumbo-seafood,worst crabs went for dinner and ordered pepper crab and chilli crab both crabs were tiny the irony waiter said  kg each but both were max  grams pepper crab was the worst ive had and it had no sauce i asked for sauce and the waiter blatantly refused we were not even given an apron or cracker for the crab i have been a loyal customer of jumbo since many years and always visit when im in singapore but after this visit i will not be returning here ever,Negative
jumbo-seafood,this place is a must have if you are in singapore the black pepper crab and the chili crab are two of my favorite dishes who would have thought something so little could pack so much flavor the little bread rolls are divine they are like unglazed donuts from the heavens above waiting to be dipped in to a sea of angels ie the chili crab stew the cereal drenched prawns were amazing,Positive
jumbo-seafood,they are well known for  dishes here  chilli crab  black pepper crab  cereal prawns we had the chilli crab and black pepper crab let me start off by saying that the chilli crab especially the sauce is phenomenal spicy tangy and sweet all at the same time the crab meat soaks up the sauce and it is just purely delicious amongst the best i have had the black pepper crab is delicious as well the black pepper marinade coats the whole crab if you are a big black pepper fan like me you will love this dish some people who are not black pepper fans are not too impressed but i loved it the chilli crab comes served whole not cut up while the black pepper crab comes out slightly chopped up the cereal prawns we did not get as for only  people it is a lot of food but i have heard they are amazing and it is a must try on my return one day back to singapore so the menu is interesting they only give you prices on  prix fixe options for  people they have both which include chilli crab and other stuff appetizer dessert etc we just wanted crab so we asked about pricing for kg raw it is s  you have to ask personally i think it was better to get the  crabs or the prawns as its what they are known for and forget the other stuff the prix fixe options are i believe s  better to get  crabs than one of these as for the  star instead of  star review is the service it is poor to below average at best for one thing they put peanuts and wet towelettes on the table and in the menu fine print they are a blurb that there is a charge if consumed for us americans who are not used to this that is ridiculous plus getting service to order food get refills on water or just straight napkins was very lackluster but the food itself is easily a  star rating highly recommended to make reservations on their website  hours before going they are very busy every day you can standby but it is not reliable of course outside seating along the river highly recommended very nice ambience,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i asked as friend who is a local to take us to the best chill crab spot in sinagpore and he took us here marcus l and his girlfriend did the ordering and soon we had the plastic bibs on and red chill sauce stained in a glove shape all over our hands we ate a lot of great food my favourite was the crab though i think when you have such beautiful crab meat it is a shame to cover up its delicate and exquisite taste with an overwhelming chilli sauce i would have much preferred it just steamed and eaten it cold without any seasoning or sauce but i think i am a seafood purist when it comes to crabs i also loved the dish which is tiles of cooked fish and prawn paste and topped tightly with a chicken skin what is the name of this delicious dish jumbo was expensive even by perth is extortionate standard but it is the best and right on the water so i guess that is to be expected book ahead to get a table inside in the air con,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crab chili crab chili crab that was all i heard about from everyone who came back from singapore so naturally this was on the list of must eats during the trip i had emailed a co worker based in singapore what were some of the recommendations to eat while in the city it is like asking a nyc local where was the best place to get pizza she mentioned chili crab at jumbo seafood and so when my wife is friend is family took us here i was more than happy they have several locations but the one we went to was next to the waters the view was fantastic especially at night and they had plenty of outdoor tables it bustling with people enjoying chili crab and other local seafood we ate a ton of food but let is talk about the chili crab the crab is not your standard dungeness crab that we are all used to in the states they used sri lankan crabs which had huge meaty claws the crab meat was succulent nice and sweet extremely juicy and tender it was a like giant delicious mutant crab as for the chili sauce it is hard to describe but it is similar to the dipping sauce that brodard uses for their pork spring rolls only chunkier with more crab meat inside with a lot more complex flavors and ton spicier i am talking really spicy maybe it was because i was practically drinking the stuff with the help of the fried and steamed bread man tou sopping up the juices then i washed it down with some local tiger beer man was it good if this was in the states i would be a bona fide regular,Positive
jumbo-seafood,when visiting singapore one must try the famous singaporean dish chili crab there are so many places that sell chili crab in singapore every local will have their own favorite spot we chose this place since it was most convenient and we were walking along boat quay eating crab can be quite messy and that is why i chose a nice sit down restaurant with white tablecloths if you have not figured this out most food places food court hawker centres etc do not provide napkins i really appreciated the cloth napkins bowl of water and lemon and the large sink right outside their bathrooms since my foodie friend was still recovering from food poisoning she only could eat the steamed mantou so i ended up eating the whole chili crab and finishing it all by myself d it was delicious the seafood was fresh service was very quick and efficient the restaurant was clean and empty at pm fyi there is free wifi nearby but weak signal if you can they have a promo going on that if you like them on facebook you will get a free drink check their website for more specials nearest mrt station clarke quay,Positive
jumbo-seafood,sadly this place was a huge disappointment service wise though food was pretty good atmosphere is to be desired big open room packed with tables huge fish tanks in the back where you watch whatever you ordered get taken lol maybe it is just my tender heart but i have always had a hard time with that type of display but moving on a lot of bareness in regards to decoration etc we had a wait but it was not bad for dinner on a saturday night once we were seated we went to order i thought seafood would be easy gluten free but apparently not i was initially told they could not make me anything when my friend pressed with more questions annoyed at how dismissive the server had been we finally settled that i could have a plain steamed crab with none of the sauces it was apparently impossible to not put wheat in any of them even the garlic and olive oil and the scallops and vegetables plain my friends ordered other things the worst part is that all these things came out and i was just sitting there waiting and watching them eat for  mins they finally brought the scallops which everyone ate as well we then all sat and waited we had to ask five yes five times about the last crab me still starving we were blown off several times asked to speak to a manager twice who never came two hours after being seated it finally came and everyone just watched me eat food was good though mine was bland as they offered no sauce options but seafood was fresh and portions good they also charge for everything without telling you the peanuts on the table yep the tea they bring you bet ur bottom when i return to singapore i wo not be rushing back,Negative
jumbo-seafood,have been here many many times chili crab pepper crab shrimp prawns more chili crab alka seltzer another beer more chili crab wow i am actually drooling seriously if you like seafood this is a busy happening place hectic and crazy so not for a romantic dinner especially with your bib and ripping into the crab this is a great great place to bring a bunch of people to start off a nice rowdy evening,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this was my first and still to the time i am writing this review only taste of chilli crab and i thought it was o k but i must say it was very pricy for the crab also i thought the flavours had not really penetrated the crab it tasted more like ketchup and sweetness than a savoury food which was really disappointing the rice and buns were okay maybe because the location was in a very central location which was why it was busier and more expensive i would suggest trying somewhere else tip the peanuts they offer you at the beginning cost money so if you do not want to eat them do not let them put it down,Negative
jumbo-seafood,so overrated feels like it is a place for tourist sat down for  hours i still did not get my desert and the bill came i am sure you can find a better place for this over priced seafood joint for tourist not coming back,Negative
jumbo-seafood,it was very messy yummy and spicy crab great to try and experience but not something i would really really crave again the whole thing is to embrace the culture and give it all a try amazing country,Positive
jumbo-seafood,could not go to singapore without trying the chili crab at a jumbo seafood never had this dish before hard to eat like most crab but worth the effort be sure to order more buns than you think you can eat because you will need them to sop up all the delicious juice all the side dishes were great well worth the  minute uber ride from the st regis if it is a rainy night try to get a table in the covered area since it gets a little crazy for the people outside when the rain comes,Positive
jumbo-seafood,finally came to this place for her legendary chilli crab i was very impressed and felt my trip and money worthwhile i had a kg chilli crab s  and it came out perfect in fact just nice not too much and not too little i did not have the alaska live crab because i did not fly  miles from sfo for live alaska crab there are tons of it in sfo is fisherman is wharf just regretting for ordering rice s   which i did not even touch and the peanuts and the tea were a waste too because i did not touch those too btw they do charge for the tiny cup s   of tea which is refillable and the peanuts s   must come back for more in the near future,Negative
jumbo-seafood,it is my first time in singapore and my friend and i were really looking forward to trying chili crabs we picked jumbo based on the good reviews we were walk ins but were able to get a table after which was great sadly after looking at the menu we had to leave because they serve shark fin soup and we can not support the inhumane unnecessary and unsustainable killing of sharks just to texturize soup please reconsider serving this product before sharks go extinct over it thank you for your consideration,Negative
jumbo-seafood,had a half day layover in singapore with the kids and their mom on the way back home to houston reserved a table for  at  pm from a month before and even though we showed up  minutes early we were told to wait until  pm sharp so walk ins got accommodated earlier than us but they were all given tables outside inside was air conditioned while outside was not and it is really important in hot and humid singapore ordered a package menu for  for sin  that includes shark is fin soup mushroom with broccoli and fried rice with chili crab being the piece de resistance omg the crab was so good and the sauce so divinely delicious we ends up scraping the sauce from the bowl using the fried mantou bread that we ordered afterwards,Positive
jumbo-seafood,yes i love this place there is always a long wait but the chili crab is so good and the little fried mantou are yummy the prawn salted egg is good too i wish i lived in sg so i could eat this more often,Positive
jumbo-seafood,we decided to try this place because my cousin was raving about their seafood particularly their crab but honestly i was pretty disappointed everything was very mediocre and a bit too sweet for my liking the food did not taste bad but given the price and the quality i probably would not recommend this restaurant to any friends visiting singapore,Negative
jumbo-seafood,first dinner during my trip to singapore was at jumbo seafood since this has become one my wife is favorite restaurants here and this place did not disappoint they have ample seating both indoors and outdoors but wait times can be long on busy evenings reservations for weekends are recommended service is attentive and with a smile a good balance of singapore efficiency that you see everywhere including the way trees are planted on sidewalks and hospitality the waiters here who make sure you are taken care of without becoming too much in your face we ordered the following crab with salt ad pepper if you are a fan of good crabs i mean really good crabs and are not afraid to roll up your sleeves and flex your muscles in cracking crab shells then this dish is for you cooked perfectly and great flavors and spices this dish is a winner i had to stop myself in sucking on pieces of the shell so as not to look like a hobo seafood noodles well made and the shrimp and squid were cooked perfectly had a bit off a kick tho but i still could not stop eating it farmed frogs one of the best versions of frog legs that i have had ever the sauce was awesome pardon my limited repertoire of powerful english words and stood on its own compared to the crab a must try seafood restaurant when in singapore,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i m a big fan for seafood must try the black pepper crab and fried shrimp with cereal also order the chinese bread with chilli crab is sauce so yummy,Positive
jumbo-seafood,overpriced food factory service the crab is good but not worth the exorbitant price,Negative
jumbo-seafood,i expected to enjoy this venue more as i would heard good things but for me the food was too rich and took too long to arrive the menu is extensive and looks like it has many delicious options i may have just hit a bad day,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crab mmmm being in singapore the one dish you cannot leave without trying is chili crab so when i finally received my last paycheck for my summer internship there i decided to splurge on singapore is speciality after hearing from my coworkers that jumbo had the best most famous chili crab to offer maybe it is the fact that i am young or the fact that i am a girl and sometimes do not need to pay for my meals but splurge in my book was clearly not the splurging i had intended to do i ended up dropping more than  on my meal and i had split my bill with my roommate who was also sitting in disbelief that the two of us would consume  worth of chili crab in my opinion this restaurant was way overpriced which along with the marginally acceptable service is the main reason why i only gave it three stars mind you the crab itself was very delicious the chili is a tomato based sauce so it was sweet and not overwhelming and tastes delicious with the fried buns i might say that their other dishes are quite good too if you can get over the fact that a plate of veggies and tofu would cost you  this also might sound pretty petty but at first i was pleased that the server poured us tea and served us peanuts until i saw that the two showed up on my bill at the end why would i pay to eat a small dish of peanuts at a seafood restaurant especially when my server disappeared for the vast majority of the night even when i wanted a refill of said overpriced tea and or peanuts however the ambience itself is quite nice the restaurant looks nice and sits right in the center of clarke quay read tourist central so you can get a nice view of the singapore river and the thousands of people passing by and jealously watching you eat seafood this restaurant is extremely crowded however things should be okay if you make reservations more than a week in advance i highly doubt anyone but tourists and birthday celebrators eat at this restaurant but being a tourist myself it is fair to say that this restaurant is signature dish definitely left a lasting impression,Positive
jumbo-seafood,good foods but too expensive i guess it is singapore but yes i love the chilli crab,Positive
jumbo-seafood,first yelp review in singapore everyone tells me that i have to try the chili crab when in singapore so when the opportunity came along friend i met during this trip wanted to go to this place to celebrate her birthday i was totally down for it and i am so glad she invited me there were five of us and we ordered two crabs one chili and one black pepper we also ordered some noodles and veggie plate i shared the ginormous chili crab with the birthday gal and oi was it delicious the sauce was amazing i thought it was going to be super spicy but it was not the sauce was just perfect spicy but not so spicy that it feels like your tongue is on fire as a matter of fact it was very flavorful you can enjoy both the spiciness and flavor what is more amazing is if you dipped the bread into the sauce or even put a few spoons onto the noodles the crab itself was fresh and meaty we each paid about  dollars which is not too bad honestly i consider it pretty cheap i would definitely want to try the pepper crab next time since this time i did not really get to try it,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i ate here twice in july  i had the pepper crab the first time and the chili crab the second time i far preferred the pepper crab it is traditional singapore style in simple pepper broth not a sweat creamy sauce like you sometimes see with this dish the chili crab i found the sauce to be too gooey not for me to each his own i also ordered other items like mee goreng noodles very good and spicy the seafood fried rice was also very good overall the service was fast and typical for a place like this surprisingly they have some good white wines that pair very well with the spicy dishes recommended,Positive
jumbo-seafood,a bit overpriced but absolutely worth it anyone visiting singapore should not be allowed to leave without ordering the chili crab and the mini buns the crab was fresh and the sauce can only be described as perfect i wish they would open a location in nyc,Positive
jumbo-seafood,textbook singapore chilly crab meh,Negative
jumbo-seafood,the food was good but also keep in mind that it was my first time trying chilli crab so i have nothing to compare it to good things indoor seating available good crab and fried bread to dip it in sauce and they crack the crab for you things to improve the waiting staff was a bit rude they forgot some of my orders the price was a bit high and they kept offering things we did not want watch out they charge you for tea peanuts and the wet napkin,Positive
jumbo-seafood,way over priced place that is tourist central i am guessing because lonely planet recommended it the chilli crab was pretty good but again expensive and what really put a damper on the experience is how they serve you peanuts and walk around pouring you green tea like it is complimentary and then it shows up on your bill pretty shameless as long as tourists keep coming they can get away with these practices i highly doubt any locals are eating here,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i would rather write this review in chinese because i ordered in chinese thus do not remember the english name of any dish i ordered  months ago but well this is yelp of course everybody comes here for a chili crab their chili crab was satisfactory in general delicious and classy though i would recommend the corner eatery near upper thompson road which provide the most yummy chili crab ever in a less decent environment unless you are taking your mother and father in law to dinner as i said classy is a tag on everything in jumbo seafood if fulfills all the western fantasy of an eastern country with jade tofu cm long razor clams the iridescent reflection on the singapore river the fish eyed twakow boats and the numerous modern skyscrapers try it ignore the price tag,Positive
jumbo-seafood,ask any taxi driver where to get chili crab and you will probably get a different answer everyone has their own opinion in my opinion jumbos is always consistently good they have a decent menu and you can definitely find something for everyone i love the mocha pork ribs one of the reasons i really like jumbos is also because you can get the cereal prawns deshelled i am sorry but i am a white guy and i dont like durian and i dont like prawns with the shell on i find the chili crab sauce here to be a tad bit sweeter there are other spots that have bigger crabs but i think all around with the food crab options and different branches all over its a pretty safe bet in terms of this branch there is always a wait if youre calling for reservations the same day for dinner forget it otherwise you will be eating at pm the service is not friendly but its there if youre a live here and you and your friends are always taking friends visitors to chili crab sign up for the jumbo membership,Positive
jumbo-seafood,good food good vibe good view recommendation chili crab pepper crab salty fish fried rice etc pro clean chili crab restaurant with great view of river con over priced there are other good places to go for chili crab but jumbo is one of the places that i would go for chili crab in singapore a lot of the restaurants in singapore is not clean as you think,Positive
jumbo-seafood,jumbo disappointment i heard jumbos standard has gone down a lot but was not believing it but after eating here last night i wo not be going there nor will be recommending it anymore terrible food and felt cheated as i was served smaller crabs than i was told standard deplorable and feels like they forgot how to cook moreover had an upset stomach after eating here grossly overrated eat at your own risk,Negative
jumbo-seafood,i usually head to the branch at east coast park because eating seafood by the sea adds authenticity to the dining experience or so i think it is probably just an unfounded bias that eating seafood next to the sea makes the catch more fresh when in reality i know that the all of the products probably came from the same wholesaler who delivers them to each jumbo branch for convenience is sake you might want to dine at the branch at riverwalk which is at the heart of singapore is nightlife clark quay my favorite food picks are  black pepper crab order the fried buns known as mantous it is sooo good then dip it in the black pepper sauce expect to get your hands super duper dirty definitely not a dish for the first date they will give you some lime water to clean your hands with after the meal but the crab smell will still linger  steamed bamboo clam with garlic and vermicelli love it bamboo clams taste like chewy abalone  steamed prawns you would be surprise how good these prawns are even without any seasoning they usually serve you some soya sauce with slices of red chili to dip the prawns  fried you tiao stuff with fish cake honestly i did not expect to be a fan of this dish because you tiaos fried dough strips are sooo oily but the ones at jumbo are crispy and golden the fish cake inside makes it even more flavorful and savory perfect combination ambiance jumbo is restaurant outdoor seating area is overlooking the beautiful singapore river so you get a good view of singpore is old port now a tourist hotspot for boat cruises i would recommend jumbo over the boat cruise any day,Positive
jumbo-seafood,touristy spot admittedly but still this place has become a usual spot for me when i want to bring a group to a chilli crab place that is more presentable place with ac and slightly better service the deep fried mantou is are to die for only,Positive
jumbo-seafood,for a a group of  americans it was great fun little place with yummy chili crab we also had the black pepper crab and dancing prawns,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i asked the concierge at my hotel where to find the best place for chili crab and he said hands down it is jumbo seafood in clarke quay i gave it a go and it was amazing the crab was tender and in this great tasty gravy that i wanted to gulp down after all the crab was gone it being chili sauce you would assume it is spicy but it was not it was just a flavorful goodness i would definitely go back,Positive
jumbo-seafood,they charge for everything even the peanuts that is already on the table why it is not like we ordered it we ordered set a which included this duck salad which we could not eat total bill was  for  people which is awfully expensive for below standard service and food i honestly absolutely love crab and was so excited to try this place and was so disappointed,Negative
jumbo-seafood,what can i say this is the place to go for chilli crab black white pepper crab egg yolk crab which i categorise as die die must eat hahaha if you have enough people to share i suggest you to order a bigger size i e   kg which the claw is more like a piece of steak and is much more fulfilling sometimes sharing a g crab by  is not so enough in that case i usually end up coming again before i take off back to hk there are  jumbos around clarke quay one is right at the river side which is more open and the view is better good to go with client foreigners the other one is at this upper circular road which is indoor and it is less crowded in terms of seating but usually serves  rounds everyday           onward however we were not being kicked out at pm and stay there till the end anyway both serve the same food with same high standard booking is needed,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i enjoyed the black pepper crab better than the chili crab i think this depends on preference this is a must try in singapore but i do not think that i would go here again,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i have been here a few times just as a family and with guests from out of town i never remember to get a reservation so i just show up early and see what is available luckily with a small group you can usually get a table if you agree to leave within about   hours or so i have had a few dishes here of course chilli crab is a must and it is very good the sauce is hot but really flavorful it is not quite as great of a chilli sauce as the seafood international out by east coast park but still good a perfect dish is the fried mantou buns excellent dipped in the chilli sauce the slightly sweet breadiness helps to cut the spice we usually get a couple of veg dishes too which are pretty standard the cereal prawns are not bad but since then i have gotten just salt and pepper prawns instead all in all i will still come here if i am meeting people in the downtown area reliably good and not so overpriced,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this place is a hot favorite of tourists busy executives but is not one that attracts a lot of singaporeans food was decent and unlike other chili crab places this proved to be a rather sterile eating experience prices are not as wallet friendly as you would get if you go further out,Negative
jumbo-seafood,last week i was down from tokyo where i live in singapore for a tradeshow this was the third time this year that i have been to jumbo and again it lived up to the billing my pal sophia my go to singapore foodie says jumbo is the place to go for crab and when it comes to food in singapore what sophia says goes there were a group of  of us thirsty from chatting with customers all day and ready to drain some tiger beer and murder some crab we started with some appetizers including some great river shrimp the chili crab was the first to come as the other reviewer said the mantou buns are a must for mopping up the extra sauce of which there is plenty we also got some veggie dishes and noodles to keep the crab company but i was waiting for his brother to make an appearance finally the pepper crab came also awesome whereas the chili crab has an ebi chili sweetness about it the pepper crab lives up to its name an has a peppery after kick good thing i cut my nails the day before singapore crab like sand at the beach gets everywhere and it was nice not to have to dig it out per prior visits the riverside branch of the restaurant was bustling as always and we sat outside as always great people watching and the river after dark feels cool the icy tiger helped bill for a dozen eating and drinking reasonably but not leaving hungry was sin  ish pretty reasonable by business dinner standards compared to north america us or western europe it is f this weekend so the place is probably packed reservations advised even after the show moves on it is popular with locals expats and tourists alike there are six locations to choose from enjoy,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crabpepper crabshrimp prawn covered in some peanut crunch type thingfried mini mantous bread  pitchers of tiger beer your waitress will make sure your mug is never empty we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves although the singaporean chili crab hype was not mind blowing nonetheless still an awesome meal i can eat the shrimp peanut crunch dish all night into bed,Positive
jumbo-seafood,delicious chili crab a bit messy but that is probably because i am a westerner and have no idea what i am doing,Positive
jumbo-seafood,very good food however the only let down is that they try to rip you off my wife and i ordered the singaporean chili crab when ordering the waitress said that the only crab they have available was a  kg crab having told that this crab is finger licking tasting hence i did not hesitate with a  kg crab when the food came out i noticed that the crab looked unusual the shell was only the size of my samsung galaxy and pieces were mixed from other crab the texture of the meats of each pieces and even the sizes of each legs did not match what i was expecting from a  kg crab i asked the waitress which she denied and tried to brush it off i felt that i was ripped off for paying for a  kg crab which it was only a mixture of different sized crabs apart from that the taste was excellent,Negative
jumbo-seafood,the crabs were amazing the wait was a bit long but they have a telephone alert system that works pretty well what can i say the crabs were amazing,Positive
jumbo-seafood,jumbo seafood is a singapore institution it is a must to order the chilli crab the experience is going to be loud and messy but that is the reality sitting outdoors in the evening is a welcome change this location is conveniently located near many bars and boardwalk,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i need my chili crabs every time i visit singapore and jumbo is the place i will go or recommend to my foreign friends if convenient location is the key factor jumbo has pretty good chili crabs not the best but still good is well situated in clarke quay and a cool place to chill by the singapore river try their mee goreng and balacan kang kong too yum,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i am a seafood lover this restaurant has been around more than  decades it is one of my monthly eating joints since my childhood days my favourite dishes are the chillies crabs not spicy at all with mun tou bread pepper crabs not hot deep fried sugar coated baby squid bamboo clams with tang hoon japanese scallop with tang hoon ee fu noodles with mushrooms worth your calories,Positive
jumbo-seafood,was a terrific experience loved the seafood one of the best in singapore service was excellent food cooked perfect just love it every time worth the extra cost,Positive
jumbo-seafood,it is all about the chili crab here and it is very good it is a little touristy and on the pricier side but i would not really hold that against this place service is what you would expect in singapore not awesome the restaurant has a bunch of outlets on the island and they are all pretty consistent in any case jumbo is a pretty good introduction to chili crab,Positive
jumbo-seafood,no trip to singapore is complete without a trip to jumbos order the chili crab for your first visit you will never order anything else again be sure to get extra buns great location too you will want to walk off dinner and there is great people watching along the key,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i did find it interesting that there was two jumbo seafood less than  min apart beyond being expensive it was pretty good i like the chili crab some at table liked pepper more one spicier the other more asian flavors fried rice bombsweet fish bombskip the duck in crepe wrap not worth it,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this is a very touristy restaurant but it is not bad if you come with a friend you can order the chili crab with the singapore sling and all the fixin that come with it all in all it is like most chinese restaurant in the world chili crab order it,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the food was good cereal prawn egg prawn chili crab but the service was comically bad i think we had to ask three times for fried buns and it took half an hour to get them,Negative
jumbo-seafood,very good customer services and delicious food i will come back whenever i think about chili crabs,Positive
jumbo-seafood,awesome place great food chili crab was wonderful this was packed when we got there great sign food was very good and plentiful highly highly recommend,Positive
jumbo-seafood,bad bad bad we we sat between two high stacks of bus tubs at a seafood place yuk and next stacks of plastic chairs this was after standing line for a number after having a reservation mcdonalds is  star for atmosphere compared to this the pepper crab tasted like pepper not crab service was terrible price was high go to long beach,Negative
jumbo-seafood,reservations are highly recommended i was able to secure a table for two on the same day for an early dinner  pm and when i arrived they informed me i would have to give up my table at  pm it really puts me off when restaurants restrict the amount of time you are allowed to stay for a meal luckily the food came quick after we placed our order nonetheless the meal was worth it the chili crab was delicious the sauce wow i wish i could bottle the sauce and bring it home to drizzle over my rice every day finger licking good with the seafood fried rice it was a lot of food for two people i suggest coming here with a larger group so you can try a variety of dishes would have given it  stars had i not been rushed,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the chili crab was good and the fried buns were good everything else was just ok it is very clearly a tourist trap where they serve you things you do not want tea peanuts and then charge you for them the service was haphazard the ambience was nil i would try for a less touristy place to try out chili crab,Negative
jumbo-seafood,terrible service they gave our order to another table nearby and left us waiting for an hour for our crab and then tried to cover up their mistake their bathroom was filthy as well they are very busy and seem complacent as a result crab was ok nothing memorable do not go here,Negative
jumbo-seafood,the chili crab was awesome we had some mis communication when we asked our waitress how much the chili crab was and she said something     and we thought she said  when she meant  for  so we ended up ordering  and devouring it between  of us amongst other things we really enjoyed the food and atmosphere,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,i wanted to wait until i visited nyc before speaking on tmbh and i am glad i did i can say after having top rated bagels in nyc that this bagel house is legit and for my sake the best i have ever had i have had some fabulous bagels but what really sets this place apart are their creations nothing is spared when creating a fresh well made be is smoked brisket or pickled beets capers or properly crispy hash brown sandwich with perfectly complimentary fillings and add ons staff and super friendly and knows your name within one visit seating is more adequate than others in the area as there are plenty that do not have any at all i know there are a lot of amazing choices in tp area but if you want an amazing breakfast with healthy or not options and a variety to satisfy any palate you will be glad you stopped here on your way,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,my recommendation is pearl harbour spam cheese scrambled eggs and some greens this is one completed delicious plate in one buns wish i had when it is still warm,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,when my friend swore two men bagel house was close to the real thing in ny i refused to believe it if no where else in america could get it right how could a small place inside of a mall in singapore do it i am not sure but this happens to be one of my only repeat experiences in the city because the bagels are just that good is it true to form nyc not entirely they are a bit on the small side but boy do they have a bite to them the old myth of new york bagel success was something along the lines of it is the elements in the water but was later debunked to be the boiling process of said water and barley to make it truly stand out could two men be employing a similar method they claim to be the first bagel house in all of singapore and started only a handful of years ago each bagels are supposedly handmade and they recommend that folks who do not want to face the daily disappointment of their potential selling out should call ahead of time to confirm availability the bagels themselves are soft and have just the right amount of density the variety is not impressive to most new yorkers montreal folks but they do have some interesting ones like cheddar salt garlic and all sorts everything bagel the salmon they are using is not the kind of lox i would find back home but this is a respectable alternative for being on the other side of the world for first timers keep an open mind this is one of the only games in town and the closest thing to anything from the us try one of their bagel sandwiches i vote for the lamb or bo ssam and beware of the morning lines,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,am on a sunday when the store opens and there is a q what the thought i was being smart be there early think again ok bagel really good these guys have done it well the combo bagelwiches pretty good execution of orders efficient and the coffee even comes out at the same time as the bagel all in all wonderful meal though like the bagel a hole in the pocket,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,unbelievable how the food and the staff are equally as great the lady at the wrap was all smiles and will to recommend and navigate the menu i got the hot link bagel add avocado and it was really great looks like the lunch options would be just as amazing if not better thanks tmbh,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,my fav is the avo baco bagel it fills me up all the way til early dinner it is a little hard to find but once you find it try it you will keep coming back for more great bagels in cbd,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,best meal in singapore it was delicious bagels fresh daily we got the last two bagels when we arrived at  pm we had the avocado bacon sandwich amazing and also had the walnut cream cheese on another bagel so good just go,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,visited singapore prior to a cruise during holidays dec  we located this place by tripadvisor and yelp so gave it a try ordered the bacon avacado bagel and pb jelly for kids and food was excellent also had their coffee and mango smoothies all good as others have commented service was excellent but beware place was absolutely packed busy we came around  am and there was a que and was standing room only limited seating obviously its busy for a reason also the music was so loud felt like i was in a club with base pounding and could not hear ourselves talking reason why i fave  stars instead of  just be aware it will be busy with loud music as others have commented on great place to do takeout also it was not cheap  usd for breakfast,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,this is probably the best breakfast place i have ever been to the wait on a saturday morning is  worth it i would recommend getting there as soon as they open if you do want to avoid the wait the staff and the quality of their food is a   for sure,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,went here cos of the hype but i felt the bagels were about average the fillings were pretty good though had the avocado with bacon and it was really fresh music was really loud and distracting so not a place to sit and chill i would go back but only for takeout,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,an amazing place a great combination of service and product they can stand their ground with any nyc or nj bagel shop it was that good a lox bagel for less than  usd easy to find and short walk from the mrt station very friendly staff love it i will be back,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,what is a bagel it is a hole with bread rolled around it ha ha just had to get that out there just gobbled down the last bite of my a b l t from two men bagel house and boy am i happy sg may look back in the future and possibly say the eastern european food scene started right here at tmbh albeit by a singaporean love the vibe from this place and of course the bagels walked up to the order counter and just about everyone in the kitchen greeted me with a big hello and a smile do not come here if you are looking for a bona fide proper new york bagel because the owner borne tells me that his bagels are made with the singaporean taste buds in mind he is tried bagels from both coasts of the u s probably in between too and has decided to make the bagels lighter and smaller he make batches throughout the day to ensure freshness and quality business had a rough start a couple of years ago but things are really rolling now swing by and get treated like a vip customer which is becoming a rarity these days and treat yourself to a round of deliciousness you wo not regret it,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,two men bagel house makes me upset why have i been living in singapore for  months without having their food why do not i live in the tanjong pagar area why do not i work in the cbd why is not the service as good everywhere else so many regrets just to tell you that this place is da bomb i heard many raves so i was super hesitant mainly due to previous experiences with hyped western places in singapore but two men delivers i took one bite of their cowking bagel which is pastrami based and i was sold it was everything i expected and more in addition the staff is amazing they are super friendly knowledgeable and cheery once i am done crying in my corner over the fact that it is quite far for me i am going back highly recommended,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,let is face it bagels for  in singapore is like chicken rice for  in london you have to make sacrifices if you are not eating local specialties once i got over that it was great every choice so far has been done perfectly the bagel toasted yet soft the ingredients top quality the smoked beef one is particularly good although being able to go and buy a decent smoked salmon bagel in singapore still remains one of my favourite discoveries in the relative food desert of tanjong pagar the filling is generous enough that these days we split one between two but we are not big eaters service is fast and friendly,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,i have finally tried this place and although it is not a ny bagel this is the closest damn thing i loved it i should say i ordered breakfast from this place avocado egg cheese bacon and the only downside was that i did not get two the bagel sandwich was glorious as if i would just gotten it from a bodega down the street i did not quite understand the weird white sauce was it mayo was it cream but honestly who the hell cares it was delicious and i would happily stuff one in my pie hole again,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,best bagels this hemisphere living in australia where there is a severe lack of quality bagels these were delicious they offer classic schmeres plus bagelwiches with a bit of singaporean flare will be going back again on our stop over not sure where the negativity is coming from,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,yuck traveled across the city for this and i can promise you these are not ny style bagels they are dry not chewy and this is the first time i have ever had an everything bagel with zero flavor the eggs were so wet and the cheese was so greasy it was just a sloppy mess on top of a dry tasteless roll people in singapore must never have tasted real bagels because these sure are not them yuck,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,they have bagels of course but also all day breakfast bagelwiches as well as pizza bagel i picked a seeded bagel and chose cowking pastrami parsley onion sour cream jalapeos montreal bacon gherkins not for me melted cheese and sunny side egg   bagel is nice and chewy add a home made iced tea for  not great will come again,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,this gets  stars from me i have been living in asia for about  years and bagels are really tough to come by this place reminded me of the bagels i had growing up they are definitely top quality the layout of the restaurant is very chill and carefully planned the menus are written across the wall in chalk in a font that screams hipster style you can take your time and read the menu and i have seen quite a few people myself included taking pictures so you can remember what they have for next time when you order at the register you give them your name and they will holler for you when your order is ready i recommend doing their two men is crafted bagelwiches do not just get a plain bagel with cream cheese they have gotten so creative with their menu and i have to say there is not one thing on the menu that does not sound mouthwateringly delicious to me i am working my way through their menu and so far everything i have had is top notch my favorites so far are the cow king and the bird and what i really love about this place is that you can choose whatever type of bagel you want for the bagelwiches i really hope they do well and open more locations,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,this small hole in the wall place is to die for packed when we went in the staff is bustling with energy my wife and i got different bagels and both agreed they were by far the best bagel sandwiches we have ever had our only regret is that we did not have room for seconds will be back,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,as someone who moved here from new york i was accustomed to having a nice crisp chewy bagel at least  times a week hence upon moving to singapore i scour the island every time my inevitable cravings hit two men bagel is an obvious choice for bagel lovers and you can see from the queue that it is made up of a lot of homesick westerners the bagels are no where near as massive as in new york and it does not have that sheen to it but then again they do not have the water the sandwiches are inventive bordering on too ambitious because the bagels themselves are not that large the filling often falls out leaving your hands a mess like all foreign foods swept far from their homeland it is more expensive especially the drinks my god it is robbery and not as good but it is all we have  star for the great  is and  is rap and hip hop playlist interrupted only by great  is emo music,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,if you are looking for a bagel in singapore this is probably your best bet ny still knows how to do it best but these bagels have a respectable density to them i went by on a friday afternoon and they were nearly out of everything best to go in the morning if you want full choice of bagel types i loved that they had scallion schmear it lacked the tang i was craving but still decent the staff was super friendly and very nice,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,first up they have moved across the street to icon village so do not go knocking on those closed doors on enggor street icon village is hopeless with its food offerings saved for  men is and we instantly picked out the spam bagel spam duh which had luncheon rockets scallion sriracha aioli sunny side avos clasped between  hand rolled toasted bagels everything was freshly made to order so it took somemins for our orders to arrive despite a pretty lean crowd on a deserted sunday afternoon i suppose if you are running tight on the clock over a typical lunch hr frenzy this is not exactly fast grub the combination was spot on i am no fan of rockets arugula but the creamy sriracha aioli masked the earthy greens and i was secretly glad to be chomping down on those greens the sunny side albeit thoroughly cooked was a perfect complement to the diced avocados for a weekend mid day indulgence this spam offering certainly came with some saving grace if life was a circle please at least let it be a bagel,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,do not come here with half empty stomach because the portion is huge and filling came during lunch hour and the place is almost full maybe due to people are still afraid to try bagels well do not be i ordered the salted two men is specialty bagelwiches which consists of so much salted juicy flavorful brisket layered with melted cheese gharkins and mustard simple but divine cannot stop mentioning about how juicy melt in the mouth tenderness of the brisket the portion is huge suitable for  very hungry person or shared with another person,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,based on other yelpers rave reviews i must have ordered the wrong thing t a b on multigrain bagel    starstoo little cheese and too much tomato while the multigrain bagel was oddly tasteless it just did not even taste like bread it did not have the right yeast y flavor i suppose we ordered  cinnamon raisin bagels and  minutes later they told us they would ran out broke my heart a tub of cream cheese to go is rather pricey  for plain  for the flavored ones i suppose i should come back to try something else maybe a cinnamon raisin bagel with the walnut raisin cream cheese and i wish they had whole wheat bagels,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,after recently moving from the us one thing i have been craving immensely is bagels i visited tmbh after reading fellow yelpers reviews and was not disappointed one bagel plain with no cream cheese schmear on their menu costs   or you can order  bagels for  i went with a friend and got  bagels toasted with no schmear mostly due to the price tag the schmear costs   extra which is quite significant compared to the cost of the bagel all three bagels i ordered black and white sesame multigrain and cinnamon raisin were excellent tasting fresh and perfect will definitely come back again when i have my carb cravings,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,came here with incredibly high expectations but it turn out alright ordered cinnamon and raisin bagel with cream cheese the bagels that i wanted all  choices were sold out so i do wonder if that was a defining decision of my review lol i felt that the cream cheese could do with more oomphf and i loveeee cream cheese so much so it was a bummer it was crowded and we had to be seated next to the speaker blaring music i will visit next time to try my bagel of choice and one of those roast beef sandwiches,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,this place makes me so freaking happy every time i am even remotely near tanjong pagar so maybe all of singapore i think to myself ohemgee i could get a bagel the lox comes with pickled beets that are freakishly pink and delicious other innovative sandwiches are also great tbh these bagel sandwiches get a little messy and filling but it is singapore and if you are looking for bagels it is really only here or sacha and son is in my book but plz let me know if you find anything else yours truly a new york bagel freak,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,fresh bagels made right in front of you very delicious any of the items looked good so i am sure you can choose any and it would be great,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,i was really impressed by this place when i woke up craving a bagel in singapore i knew i should not set my expectations too high i am from new york but they really proved me wrong the food was delicious and the staff were wonderful it was a bit difficult to find but it is well worth the search highly recommend,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,a no funky business self service bagelstop serving excellent combinations from basic spreads to heartier multi topping sorts think blt on steroids at prices that are highly reasonable,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,bagel heaven need to try them plain for the real test but so far so good based on the  sandwiches i have tried shame there are no poppy seeds allowed here though,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,one thing i love about singapore is that there are enough western options available if i ever get tired of asian cuisines sure sometimes it might cost an arm and a leg to get a taste of home but c est la vie right it is about damn time bagels have come to the red dot and two men bagel house is filling that void for me you can find these guys opposite cold storage in the icon village extension i am somewhat of a bagel purist so i stuck with my favourite sesame bagel with plain cream cheese i did love how they added black sesame seeds to theirs though my colleague had a cinnamon raisin bagel with walnut raisin cream cheese which she loved i mean where else in sg can you get walnut raisin cream cheese they also have heavier meals if you are looking past cream cheese so check em out i also loved how they were blasting a live recording of john mayer while we were there and the chalkboard is titled menu of sorts these guys just speak to me and i must say they are as good as it gets in sg,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,i was very impressed with the bagels from two men bagel house as a long time bagel lover it is great to see a business take these delicious doughy circles seriously apparently there are very few places to get a good bagel in singapore these guys are the real deal the owners told me they travelled to all the bagel hot spots around the world to work out exactly how to make the perfect bagel i think they have nailed it i had the fruit and cinnamon bagel with walnut and raisin creamed cheese i had never tried walnut and raisin cream cheese before and it was a revelation especially on the spicy fruit bagel they do not just offer the bagels they have more full breakfast options eggs etc that accompany bagels too my only gripe is that they did not have any tea a breakfast drink staple,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,best bagels in singapore not quite what we are used to in nyc but still hits the spot and they only seem to be getting better with time i am here once every couple weeks and consistently leave happy staff is nice and bagels sammiches affordable and good i would say breakfast items are better than lunch but i am also just a big fan of breakfast food have tried everything on the menu oo my order sesame bagel toasted with jalapeno cream cheese tomatoes and cucumbers would also recommend spam or chorizo breakfast sandwichservice very friendly they will remember your order usually pretty fastprice less than  per pax overall good for breakfast brunch delivery available through deliveroo carries pretty well,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,this place is great the guys in the kitchen were adorable and working hard to create orders from the line forming behind me i ordered the gypsy on rye bagel which came with egg bacon black forest ham and hash browns do not bother to order any sides because it is like a denny is grand slam breakfast shoved between two slides but tastier and it is inside a clean air con accessible mall right next to my hotel carlton city hotel would have given  stars if the  coffee were bigger than oz but i loved the food people and vibe,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,as a fan of all things pastry i was really delighted that i somehow managed to convince my colleagues to have bagels for lunch it was one of the establishments that kept appearing under most recommended whenever i was around the area so i really had to try it the place itself reminded me of a small cafe seatings were limited and the menu was mostly written in chalk on the boards above pricing aside hint its abit expensive for bagels but then again everything around this area is priced on the higher end the bagels were really fresh and delicious i ordered myself a chix bagel which was basically mayo chicken with an assortment of herbs and spices inside what took me back was not the filling but the bagel itself they went out of rye bagels and i decided to go for the caramelized onion flavour i think thats what its called not knowing what to expect the explosion of moist flavor from the bagels was really something i was not expecting since what i ordered was actually quite dry that being said i have decided to make it my personal mission to at least try half of the bagels on menu the flavour combinations all sounds very interesting and delicious if you are looking for a quick quality breakfast lunch or snack and dont mind paying abit extra for yummy freshly made bagels do give this place a try,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,this place was very good and that coming from a new yorker who is a bagle snob staff was very nice,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,very good and healthy fast food however located within a mall it tends to be a bit chilly it is popular and was packed when i went there the bread makes you full i would not call this a brunch but a proper bagel lunch,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,as a new yorker who is unashamedly picky about bagels and sandwiches two men bagel house is one of my favorite places to go to as a pregnant lady who is been craving bread two men bagel house is the only place i want to go consistent quality for all bagels you cannot go wrong with any of the options though i have only tried their regular savory bagels not the sweet ones top two faves the ablt highly recommend adding some scallion cream cheese the lox so good,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,this totally satisfied my american bagel craving i had the ablt and it did not disappoint i wish i lived closer as its the perfect weekend brunch,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,my timing was pretty bad lunchtime very crowded nevertheless i made it to the counter and ordered a rodeo i love roast beef and it sounded great i ordered a rye bagel and set down at one of the large tables that are meant for sharing the bagel arrived shortly thereafter what surprised me was the brown colour of the roast beef but i tasted it anyway it did taste different from what i am used to and was a bit too thick and fatty for my personal taste but the greens and the relish and the sauce very nice the bagel itself was close to fluffy but still some density for a good bite and taste without having to worry about an immediate shutdown of any bowel movements which is often the case with heavy bagel dough later on i was curious whether roast beef in s pore is different from what i am used to and went on their facebook page there was a photo that showed the rodeo with pinkish roast beef so i do not know what piece of meat i had today but it surely unfortunately i forgot to take a photo was not the standard i did love the friendly smiley staff having had my share of snobbish ignorant staff at other places this week this was really nice so i will be back,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,went to eat there with a group of friends and they had ran out of bagels annoying especially having travelled there specifically from seeing good reviews,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,outstanding service the bagel sandwich is are delish cold turkey hawaiian sandwich bagels,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,this may be the first time i am doing a review without having even gone to the shop in question two man bagels let me explain i organized a potluck brunch on sunday and my american friend brought a giant brown bag to lunch i was all hrmph who brings store bought food to a potluck as i cooked my organic sausages from ryan is when he said i brought bagels that made me almost drop my sausages right there bagels in singapore please tell me it is not those expensive things masquerading as bagels from new york that are sold in cold storage nope it is from two man it is right by my house i chat with them all the time and they make awesome as good as it gets in singapore bagels oh and try the walnut cinnamon raisin something magic spread in that tub and thank me later at that point i was pretty stoked to find the bag contained twenty bagels in a gazillion flavors i could not find a sesame bagel cos i am boring like that but i found a brown raisin one popped it in the toaster and generously spread the magic stuff on oh ma gawsh oh my i ate that bagel in about a minute and then i ate a half more it was crisp on the outside and had a good chew granted it is not new york or bodo is great but hey we are in singapore plus i am told the prices are faaaairly reasonable unlike the child i traded in at sacha sons for a lox bagel so yes the next time i intend to blow my carb budget i am taking this bum down to icon village wherever that is,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,i am a crazy bagel fan i would have one or two a day every time i am in nyc it is my post yoga breakfast staple i even signed up for bagel baking classes just so that i can make my own i still have not though because nothing in singapore satisfies my craving well sacha sons does a decent one but there is only  option sesame with garlic herb schmear i have been meaning to try two men bagel for the longest time upon word that freshly baked hand rolled doughs are done here to determine the quality of the bagel i had to order them on their own bagels are priced from   onwards i went with the cinnamon raisin bagel with walnut and raisin cream cheese   because sweet is always logical with a latte well well knock knock the crust was more like a shell with a slightly blistered crust all around it was too hard mind you i am comparing them to the nyc ones plus the dough was a little thin thus it lacked that nice doughy chew flavor wise it was also kind of strange with an alkaline aftertaste possibly due to the almost pretzel like shell perhaps i should have stuck with the regular cream cheese because the walnut raisin one was kind of grainy instead of rich creamy and the amount was so little urgh spoiltbynyc next time i may just go with the plain cream cheese and berries jelly but honestly they need to have more cheese on these well jr really liked the chix   on his onion bagel the tender house roasted diced chicken thigh were generously smothered in lemon garlic aioli and peppered with the sourish pickled relish and fresh greens we both agreed that the filling was delicious but it overshadowed the bagel it could have been any other bread in fact it would have been better if it were a different carb that did not jab our gums with the hard shell i had a few bites of the onion bagel on its own and it was rather flavorless alkaline and hard bah i really wanted to love two men bagel but i cannot can i like it maybe but it kinda ranks the same as the packaged nyc bagel factory bagels which may not be as fresh but at least their crust is better go for their bagel wiches to avoid disappointment at least it will fill you up and the filling will distract you from the bagels or get the sesame bagels from sacha sons and slather it with your own cream cheese mix,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,a small little place nestled inside a mall in tanjong pagar offers a verity of bags usually very packed around noon lunch time good to go there a little earlier excellent lox bagel and walnut cream cheese bagel as well,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,wow this place is truly exceptional they get everything spot on the bagels are fresh chewy and tasty beyond belief the piglet which includes a hash brown crispy bacon garlic aioli sauce lettuce and maybe tomato was scrumptious definitely one of the best bagel sandwiches i have ever had on top of that they serve these bad boys all day long prices are reasonable   for the piglet if not a touch pricey given the size of the servings taste makes up for that though i also went out on a limb and splurged on the   lemonade it was worth it i even got a free refill probably would not happen if i had not been one of only  or  customers on a lazy sunday but kudos for the responsive service given the circumstances the vibe is relaxed and you can see the young staff rolling the dough and tossing those suckers in the oven absolutely  worth another or multiple visits,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,the bagels here are legit having lived in new york and philly for more than ten years i am a huge bagel snob and was suffering from huge bagel withdrawal after moving to singapore it was not until i discovered tmbh that i was cured sure you can find bagels at fair price and jason is but if you want high quality bagels that actually taste fresh and authentic you have to come here it is located in icon with ac and free seating their bagels are chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside they also have an amazing creative selection of savory bagel sandwiches the staff is also very friendly and tries to remember the names of the regulars great food great service great atmosphere scarcity in sg,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,i do not think i can add much to all the reviews here if you have never had a bagel this is probably a rather overpriced experience but if you cherish the memory of a deliciously crisp and chewy bagel with cream cheese lox or pastrami then this is one of the only good places that serves up a taste of new york i think the pastrami here is not quite as good as the only other place i have found with good bagels here sacha sons but it is still pretty decent the bagels themselves are of course amazing i like their non pretentious attitude here they allow you to bring whatever drinks you want to accompany your bagel in fact they helpfully suggest that the cold storage opposite has chilled wine for sale i have never seen that level of hospitality elsewhere kudos to them,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,first off i will have to say i am a bit jaded because i live upstairs so it gives me a reason to like this place that being said i totally love this place the bagels are great and fresh i love the sandwich selection and then they have seasonal ones during the holiday like pumpkin cream cheese around halloween they have great breakfast sandwhiches too the people are always super nice they say hi when i walk by always ready to strike up a conversation it has a nice little cafe feel its a nice spot to just hang out and work on your laptop and have some coffee totally recommended,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,if you want good food and a cute view according to my colleague this is the place you want to be for breakfast lunch and maybe even dinner my first counter with two men bagel house was during a yelp event that my friend brought me to also the event where i downloaded the app and joined the community where there were coffee and bagels i had quite a good impression of the menu that they brought over during the event and definitely fell in love with the jalapeo cream cheese it is to die for imho the bagels that were brought to the event were way beyond the normal plain bagel and my friend and i were lucky enough to be the last to share a sundried tomato bagel i highly recommend this because the bagel itself is so flavorful it was a more diy pick your own fillings at the event which i liked because friend and i decided that we should share the bagel and have two different flavours in one bagel as we did not want to take one each too much bagel for breakfast my office recently moved to somewhere near icon where tmbh is located in fact we are practically across the road neighbors now and i had to had down to try at least one other bagel right thus began the quest to find lunch buddies who wanted bagels too which was not too hard because all i had to do was shout bagels for lunch and i got a few brave volunteers that took the journey to tmbh with me there was a crowd it was around lunch time and there were many other brave knights who had braved the cbd heat to icon and were waiting be around for their orders even though tmbh has seats not many were filled up because office people we just like to have lunch in office me especially because what is a cafe in the office for if we do not use it i got myself a piglet to bring back and i swear best piglet ever it is something i highly recommend everyone to try if they are looking for a breakfast brunch lunch bagel in my humble opinion,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,great place awesome bagel friendly service best place for sunday breakfast at tanjong pagar i tried babe bagel and flat white,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,thank goodness they are a ways away from my office if they were closer i would probably indulge too often super yummy,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,we had smoked tomato souptomato avocado basil bagelwich in an onion bagel rye bagel with jalapeo cream cheese aaand an olive rosemary bagel if you are feeling overwhelmed by the different types of bagels you should be it is got really flavor fullllll food oddly hard to get these days no idea why really wish i worked nearby so it could be my go to place for lunch  star because i really wished it was in a caf type place instead of a bistro in a mall it deserves a better place,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,currently i am sitting here in icon indulging in this bagel as my little fingers type away i read a review from a fellow yelper and felt the need to try this place it does not hurt that this place is two minutes away from where i live back to the bagel it is a little greasy but i love it the nutella the added crunch of the pistachios and the bagel itself are superb the people working here are super nice too give this place a go if you are yearning for a good ole fashioned bagel,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,er muh gawd that shiz was good i was looking at new apartments long story in the area and needed to pop over to cold storage to get ranch dressing and other annoying american crap and spotted this little unassuming bagel place blasting rock music i was going to keep going when a guy was like hey hello how are ya i was intrigued and everyone knows you should not go into the grocery store hangry so off to bagel land i went i asked him what the most popular bagel situation was and he told me two one was the rodeo i was a little skeptical being from texas anything in singapore called the rodeo could not like up to that name right but it sounded mildly interesting so i went with it the service first of all is super friendly but they only take cash or net no cc my bagel goodness gcame out in a jiffy and it was really good i chose the sea salt bagel they should sell them to go and it came with some kind of mustard relish and roast beef i think whatever the mixture it was good i could barely finish it because it is a meal but very tasty my only worry is that if i move in the neighborhood this will up my carb intake but it will be worth it,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,i wish they had a larger sitting area but otherwise delicious bagels plan on lines and long wait time but its worth it,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,yep official this place just changed my life with only one bagel do yourself a favor and try something this place has got style flavor fusion and makes me so happen when i get one of these while the calorie count is not great it is totally worth it i cant wait to get back and try more of their crazy flavors,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,so visiting my brother here in singapore and we wanted some bagels for breakfast now we are from nyc so we know how a bagel should taste for some reason this bagel was flat it was missing some of that cushion now i am sure it is really hard to get bagels here in singapore but  before in baking dough is dough needs to rise this gives it that consistency of that doughy taste unfortunately there was no rise they have great combinations of putting a sandwich together but their main focus should be making that bagel taste great try it out and you can see what i mean,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,went to try this bagel shop in icon village awesome bagel sandwich for breakfast highly recommend,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,best bagel i have had in a long time love the atmosphere too definitely recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a quick and yummy bite to eat,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,while i am very impressed to find a top tier bagel in singapore it is hard to give this place  stars perfectly tasty and well prepared but relatively small bagel for the price it is probably the best bagel in singapore so do not misunderstand the lack of a th star but it is hard to be blown away by something this simple the guys manning the shop are friendly and hard working they take cash and nets but no credit cards which i find annoying in this day and age,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,disapponted wanted to try for the first time but was not opened when we reach at pm and yelp say it closes at pm,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,so delicious fast service great coffee we tried plain and onion bagels with various combinations of cream cheese peanut butter jam and nutella the bagels are toasted perfectly maybe with a bit of butter though i am not certain to have that nice chewy dough we will be back,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,they make their own bagels and the bagels alone are amazing some creative sandwich ideas or just have it with cream cheese or butter if you want to keep it simple the gorilla press orange juice and coffee is also delicious very friendly and welcoming staff this is the bagel shop singapore needs,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,great bagels hot fresh and boiled like a good new york bagel should be the guys who work there are really nice too cannot beat a bagel coffee and genuine exchange all before am,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,this is the only dedicated bagel place i know of in singapore and they serve up delicious bagels and bagel sandwiches definitely try their breakfast sandwich bagels and the lox every week seems to bring some new speciality sandwiches which keeps the menu fresh i would give them  stars but there is not a huge variety of cream cheese schmears or types of bagels but that being said the got they basics down right,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,rather plain like the vibe and kindness of the owner but taste does not live up to the reputation it has,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,initially i found this bagel place from yelp at that time i was not too sure if yelp in singapore works as good as the one back in the states but glad i read through all the reviews before i went into the actual store told my colleagues about this place and got her hook up with this amazing bagel house she ended up going to this bagel house almost everyday meanwhile i was busy with my works and did not start to visit this place until two weeks ago it turns out to be the best bagel place i ever been to hands down they handmake all of their bagels which you rarely find it even in the states personally i grew up eating a lot of bagels during my high school years i always had some cravings when i came back to asia luckily i discovered this place and all the bagels here are on point also all the staffs are very sweet and shoutout to borne for making amazing coffees all the time food a variety of bagels you can choose from they have some great menus and definitely going to suit your taste buds my favorite one is lox bagel and they deliver good quality foods consistently people service i always value customer services more than anything else i promise you you wo not regret talking to any of those staffs there i pay a full respect to the business model they have for the bagel house keep up with the good work man will definitely come back visiting when i come to singapore,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,i have lived in new york and there is nothing like an authentic bagel slightly crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside unfortunately singapore bagels have never been up to scratch until now tmbh bagels are pretty close to the real thing i had the classic salmon and cream cheese the filling was substantial and the salmon perfect not too salty i will be back,Negative
two-men-bagel-house,freshly made bagels high quality ingredients solid portions and great and friendly staff and service closest thing i have found in singapore to the bagel places back home u s i come here every week awesome,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,what stands out more than bagels which are as authentic as can be is the friendly owner and wonderful customer service something you do not get to see in singapore,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,great spot to grab a bagel sandwich on the weekend the tab is great and you can add to their sandwiches the guys were more than happy to cook up some egg whites for me and add it to my sandwich super friendly crew manning the restaurant as well if you are craving a bagel this is definitely the spot to go to in singapore,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,a comfortable no frills coffee shop right in the everton park hdb it is a bit hard to find among the buildings but it is worth looking for nylon coffee roasters is better defined by saying what they do not have no chairs no sofa no frapuccinos no syrup no whipped cream no fancy oversized mugs no merchandise no bossa n whatever music no paper cups with your name misspelled on them they are very clear on what they offer excellent quality coffee the menu is quite simple three different brews either hot or iced they will let you choose which coffee you want and they have amazing central or south american beans to choose from at the centre there is a big table for people to stand around while enjoying a quick cup the staff are very efficient and friendly one of them took time to ask me how my coffee was it was fantastic perfect taste i challenge anyone to tell me if they have seen that happen on a franchise coffee shop and this is the main virtue of this place they are obsessed with quality they use scales thermometers and timers in order to brew the perfect cup of coffee every time even the stuff they sell is useful stuff filters cups brewing tools instead of merchandise they are on a mission to raise the bar on singapore is coffee culture and judging by the crowd of customers they are succeeding there are two basic philosophies when it comes to coffee bars there are those that focus on their atmosphere furniture and general feel sacrificing the coffee on the other hand there are those that focus on the quality of the coffee they serve nylon coffee roasters are clearly of the second kind and that is always welcome,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,this place came highly recommended by a friend she was not kidding when she said it was hard to find it is kind of hidden in an apartment complex it has an american hipster coffee shop feel there are maybe only   chairs inside but there is some outdoor seating and also a tall long table with standing room inside inside is definitely preferred for the air conditioning the menu is simple and focused on coffee the flat white was solid pricing was not bad for coffee but beans are a bit more expensive service was friendly cash only if you are nearby it is worth stopping in for coffee,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,this shop is closed for renovations yet the owner did not update in the system on the system it reflected open waste a trip there together i also saw other guess make a trip there the owner just walk out like nothing has happened what an idiot no sense of responsibility,Negative
nylon-coffee-roasters,great little coffee shop that is in the middle of a twisted maze of a building complex not a lot of seating but very kind baristas and some really great coffee the standing table in the middle is definitely a great spot if you are on the taller side having air con is also a big plus,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,a hard to find coffee place tucked away in the heart of a hdb complex this place takes its coffee seriously the staff is great and will give you recommendations as to what blend and preparation to select i got the beans from guatamala with a dash of milk wonderful aroma from the coffee and the place in general cash or nets only and not a lot of seating but the coffee is top notch,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,coffee is good but you have to take it exactly as given asking for sugar is like requesting illegal substances to be added they argue the coffee is designed perfectly and needs nothing else even a request to take away is met with a frown as the cup affects the flavor,Negative
nylon-coffee-roasters,one of the best coffee we have had and wonderful pricing only downside is seating else it be a  star for sure,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,this is my favorite coffee shop in singapore i try to visit whenever i am in town and bring their beans home with me,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,just brilliant expertly prepared single origin coffees and warm hospitality in a highly unexpected refreshingly ungentrified location,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,my great auntie has lived at everton park for decades and once upon a time i even lived here too and i remember the days before when there was nothing remotely hipster about this housing block it is really cool to see cute new cafes and coffee shops moving in and i have been to nylon every time i am back in town that said there is no doubt that the coffee at nylon is great and i hail from a place where awesome coffee is the norm there is still something about nylon that strikes me as utterly pretentious it caught me by surprise to be told albeit politely that their coffee is sweet enough on its own that no sugar is needed or provided and i should try it and see for myself it was odd being schooled on how coffee should be taken and if even the most hipsterish mission coffee shop in san francisco tried this the ridiculousness of it would be blogged about endlessly so yeah mixed feelings about this place good coffee just do not bother asking for sugar,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,this coffee shop is so hipster it hurts but i loved it i have been to nylon quite a number of times and the coffee i dare say is one if not the best in singapore the bunch of us know the owner of the shop he is also an alumni of the papa palheta coffee movement here in singapore and he will always there to share with us any specialty beans they have and would recommend some or else it is just a casual chat coming to nylon is like going to a friend is place where if you are a regular you sort of know the crowd here this coffee roasters serves only coffee but if you fancy a bite you can always walk over next door merely  steps for some cakes or shepherd pie they are pretty good too if there is one thing i would nick pick about this place is the lack of chairs there are less than  chairs in the shop and plenty of standing space there is a long communal table where everyone would just stand around it while enjoying their cuppa joe i guess they want everyone to feel young and hip like how we would enjoy our beer in a bar standing and chatting located on the ground floor of a hdb flat at everton park you have to navigate yourself around but it is easy to find we paid  for a oz latte and two iced coffee i would come back again and again and again and again,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,excellent coffee a bit difficult to find this place but it is totally worth it and it is not expensive,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,my first reaction when checked in here omg so many reviews deserve it truly deserves this much reviews i will describe coffee here as honest sincere decent strong smart i love honest people who runs a cafe eatery with all their heart and bringing things they love to share with others the owners definitely knows their stuff coffee it is my first visit and i was overwhelmed by how great coffee in singapore could taste with just beans and milk during my first visit i was told that their standing space is temporarily shut due to shortage of manpower it is running on a small space now but everything is still running in an orderly manner where the staff remembers customers faces and labeled their customers according to their face despite the space constrain and crowd orders were not mixed up and still served in an orderly manner anyway just buy and go la huh there is no space for you to sit and chill to enjoy your coffee i think it is more like a take away stall for now the menu is very simple hot or iced black or white coffee the price tag is the best a real good decent iced coffee cost  this is so much better than what you can get elsewhere i see notices that the owners source coffee beans direct from columbia see what i mean by sharing their passion and love to others,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,so much has already been said about nylon and there is no doubt that they have been and are key to singapore is rise as one of the great coffee cities in the world with that in mind i have been inclined to give them five stars but i still end up at four the main reason is that while the coffee is roasted with great skill and the filter coffees are made very well i still see some room for improvement the main things that have annoyed me a bit is that often the coffees are out so perhaps only one of three coffees on the menu can be ordered and there has happened more than once that there are no beans at all for purchase the execution of the filters is often good but i do also believe that they could fine tube it a bit ti make it world class as i often have their coffee made better at other places and at home the place is however great for coffee and the location in everton park does feel more real and like a local experience at least to a visitor like me the space is considerably larger now then when they opened so there are actually seats outside for around  people and the high table inside can easily hold around  people the atmosphere is always nice and friendly and it seems like a lot of people living in the area go here as well do however not come in search of food as there is nothing really still this is one of the best places for a cup of coffee in singapore and it should be visited by anyone remotely interested in good coffee,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,do not ever come here i mean it stay away i would like to keep this place to myself yes i will end up killing the thing that i love most but i do not care i have reviewed this place on tripadvisor and i am beginning to think i should stop saying good things about this place on the internet but i cannot help myself this is a no nonsense coffee joint run by people who really care about coffee and know their product absolutely unpretentious and sincerely dedicated to putting the best cup of coffee they know how in front of you dennis and jiamin maintain control over the entire process from sourcing to roasting to brewing all just to be able to say with absolute honesty and sincerity that they have given you the very best cup of coffee likely in all of singapore if you love coffee or think you love coffee dennis jiamin will take good care of you at nylon coffee roasters,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,i love filter coffee and would grab any opportunities that i come across to try any cafe serving filtered coffee nylon coffee roaster is a cozy little corner for customers to chill out for a break there is little seating here literally less than  chairs however standing tables are provided if you are looking for a quick coffee break after lunch with   friends this is a nice recommendation not recommended for big group gathering,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,the everton park hdb estate houses a number of nice small joints and nylon coffee roasters is located on the quieter side off cantonment road the small place was packed once we found it with a line building outside and i was surprised to see that there really is no seating but standing only at a community high table with no space left and the very small counter where you order and pay with the coffee grinders and machine at the back and if you are thinking of downing a muffin with your coffee wrong place this is coffee only it was a very hot day and we ordered iced coffee white and a ristretto with milk the lady serving us had a very organised tone about her and i was not sure if i liked the military style in which she asked what we wanted but i guess she wanted to keep the line moving and i forgot about it when she spoke to my hubby about how he wanted his coffee exactly as he is very particular they settled on a kind of ristretto plus a shot yes my husband cannot deal with weak coffee with milk so basically so strong that it nearly kills you and then back it up a little she did just that and he was amazed at how smooth the coffee still tasted as strong coffee is often just bitter and nasty my iced white coffee tasted great also very smooth and whatever beans they used i liked the full bodied flavour that did not let the milk overpower them speaking about the beans i really would have purchased coffee to take home but they do not recommend grinding at the shop you are supposed to do that at home not feasible for us as i did not pack all of my kitchen equipment from germany and do not see the need to purchase another grinder here so no coffee for me i thought long and hard on how to rate them and settled on three stars for the excellent product but the in my point of view lacking practicality in the dealing with customer requirements i might be back for their coffee though,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,the treasure hunt is part of the joy of finding this spot buried under an apartment block keep your eyes peeled because it would be easy to miss this tiny nook of a store there is barely room for a coffee machine and a few people so it is hardly the place to hang around for a long time but if you do the staff wo not make you feel bad about it grab a chair if you are lucky and a magazine and drink as many coffees as you can before your heart gives up or prop yourself outside and watch the coming and goings of the neighbours these guys totally know what they are doing and the coffee is some of the best i have had in singapore,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,excellent coffee a bit difficult to find this place but it is totally worth it and it is not expensive we paid  sgd for a cup of cortado and a double shot of espresso the service is also exceptional very friendly staff,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,a true third wave micro roaster nylon coffee roasters located in everton park is a hidden gem on the ground floor of a large residential business complex located just a short walk from the outram park mrt station the small shop designed in the reclaimed exposed metal style that is typical of this style of business offers straight up coffee with no flavored offerings such as mocha is a small area is dedicated to coffee preparation items such as drip containers filters and cups bulk bean purchases can also be made and a fair assortment at reasonable prices is available,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,great spot to hang out with a cup of coffee in hand i get a kick out of watching the coffee orders being made nylon takes their coffee really seriously from weighing the grinds precisely to ensure that perfect grind to water ratio for a hand poured cup the vibe at nylon is great a gathering place for the neighborhood and familiar faces it seems like everyone knows each other or bumps into each other by happen chance here regularly nylon is on the ground floor of an hdb complex called the everton this whole area is really unique with a ton of great boutique shops cafes dessert places even a korean rice cake joint so random but so fun to visit and explore the area and feel the really unique singaporean vibe here do drop by,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,solid coffee in the outram park neighborhood location is hidden in a hdb block so you definitely need to search for it minus one star for limited seating options,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,there is a real charm at nylon i was telling my friend that everytime i am halfway through a cup there i am wishing for the next one it is tiny there is often only  seats inside and  bar stool if you are lucky but it is up close it is personal i feel like i am catching up with pals whether i bring a pal of my own or not but it is the kind of place you want to bring your mates too i was very touched recently when jiamin brought out a little container of chinese new year sugee cookies she had been gifted with to share with us mmmi think sometimes at the popular indie places as they get more and more different staff manning the machines so they can let the experienced ones have more flexible hours off or man a new shop you sometimes get the odd cup that is lukewarm and it is always at a busy crowded time when there is pressure to get through the orders and you almost feel bad to comment that it is not warm enough and it is on the side of bland you can also see the crema is limited and the latte art indistinct coz you know they will be saying oh it cannot be too high a temperature otherwise it will be burnt we served it to you this temperature on purpose i mean we can make it for you again but it is meant to be this cold excuses aside and that is what they are because they imply that you do not know what substandard coffee you have been drinking before and a few times i encountered this i actually had been drinking weekly at the same joint or their sister joint i find that nylon is consistent consistent not as in boring but as in quality control folks in this case it is consistently exciting coz each sip there is flavourful beautifully balanced tasty warm and warmly served please if you see me there and you have  of the few seats offer it to me as i am very flatfooted and my feet sometimes ache haha having said that i do not mind at all standing there and have even offered my seat up before it is what the friendly regulars do here it may not be for everyone i think my friend did describe it accurately where she said if she wanted a quiet one on one catchup she would not pick here coz it is so close everyone can hear your conversation but if you are open and would not mind a chat with whoever and some pretty chill and nice regulars turn up sometimes behind the counter it is a cool place and the coffee made for a fantastic afternoon,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,you know these people are serious about their coffee and their coffee alone hwen you see that a options are limited w simple names it is either coffee with or without milk hot or cold filter or expresso b no latte art c no food items d no sugar offered i can see they really want you to focus on your cuppa it is also such a hipster thing that third wave coffee is to be found in the void deck of one of the oldest hdb neighborhood in singapore oh how so badass the first time i visited was a weekend and the place was jam packed with people standing with cup in hand yes standing there are no seats but you can take your coffee with you and sit on the benches in the community space so to respect their dedication i always go for black coffee hoping that one day i can master the skill of identifying all those fruity notes somehow without the distraction of food i do find myself focused on tasting the cup in hand the staff are eager to help and knowledgeable i also detect a strong sense of pride and ownership since they invariably ask me how i find the coffee every time without fail they have closed off their usual standing space last i visited since some of their staff were off sourcing beans i remember this happened a couple of times so you should check online before visiting to avoid disappointment the other thing i found out last time is a new hk cafe opening next door and they are ok with you bringing your cup of coffee from nylon into their space as long as you order something so another option if you want to sit,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,nylon is one my favourite boutique specialty coffee roaster in singapore located among hdb flats nylon attracts coffee drinkers from surrounding small businesses during weekdays you will also find weekend cafe hunters to find the next best tasting flat white if you are also serious with brewing your own coffee do order a bag of specially selected hand drip beans in advance for pickup on the day seriously they run out fast,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,this place had amazing coffee likely the best i have had in singapore do not expect to sit down and relax here it it is a quick order drink go type place with a few wooden benches outside just skull it like an italian there was one thing i really did not like about nylon coffee roasters upon my partner ordering her coffee she asked for half a teaspoon of sugar the barista politely asked her to try it without sugar no matter how good coffee is i do not think someone should be told politely asked to try their coffee a different way particularly if they have been drinking it for the last  years as i said other then that superb coffee and i do see the team here love what they do,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,decided that we need to go local so i went on a sunday morning quest for coffee beans while aga studied we have been bringing them back from trips to australia would never ever have stumbled across this place without the recommendation they roast their own beans and serve nothing but coffee super happy with the four chairs espresso blend and  iced coffees i have had there on both visits the staff were friendly and knowledgeable last night i snuck in just before closing and the whole team were cupping different roasts that someone had brought back from scandinavia,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,coffee as it should be straight up sans the fluff with only  variations milk black filter you can be pretty assured these guys know what they are doing i do not typically enjoy my coffee with milk but nylon does an impressive white with perfect consistency having said that i have enjoyed all  on the list and it does not hurt to alternate your options with each visit,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,some beautifully complex and well crafted shots and being served in a quiet residential corner of outram park good things happen when a cafe is set up for the right reasons for example when the owners are passionate about coffee this is certainly the case at nylon single origin beans as well as blended varieties sourced from south america are roasted in nylon each week nylon is signature blend el primero gives a medium bodied espresso with distinct citrus notes the citrus notes never overwhelm the espresso this is clearly the product of experimentation and time spent perfecting the blend it is a nicely balanced shot not too astringent which also lends itself to smooth and subtly flavoured cappuccinos and lattes there is an interesting approach to the menu also rather than having conventional lattes and cappuccinos there are oz oz and oz sizes available this is a clever idea while some franchise chains serve what are essentially bowls of caffeinated warm milk the owners of nylon have ensured that a broad variety of preferences are catered for while never losing the underlying coffee taste coffee is always the most fundamental component of each drink furthermore as milk is steamed lactose becomes more soluble coffee which has been prepared correctly should not need sugar this is one of the many things that are not merely done correctly at nylon but are done very well there is a retail section also with a good selection of beans on sale as well as a smaller variety of accessories such as coffee filters the seating area itself is small but there are a number of benches directly outside as an alternative overall this is certainly a place that anyone who loves coffee should visit,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,a tiny spot by any means but they do tell you they are not set up as a caf instead as a coffee roaster with a little space to let you taste their wares nylon is only two months old and serve only coffee but owners dennis and jiamin have quite the following perhaps from their time as partners and baristas at artisan roasters papa palheta and loysel is toy the menu is straightforward start with espressos black or white made with their signature el primero blend whites are denoted by volume and not type so cappuccinos caf lattes and flat whites cost the same if you are after the same one size get a oz oz or oz and taste how the espresso works with various amounts of milk i like the oz best its most like a piccolo latte but get a oz if you are after a regular sized caf latte if you are a bit of a coffee nut i think you will really like the brew offerings i have had great pour overs made with the kalita filter their single origins really sing and i have had some super juicy flavours yeah okay i am a bit of a nut if you get a chance say hi and talk to them about how you would like your coffee they are nuts for the stuff and its great to talk to people who love what they do after conversations like that i usually end up drinking a couple more than i mean to thankfully coffee is not bad for you at least that is what i keep telling myself,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,nylon is a stalwart among the rd wave cafes their coffee does not hide behind meaningless names and labels like latte or flat white pfft coffee here is either served black or with milk although they do make a slight concession to hipster fashion by marking their milk coffees with lovely milk hearts but i digress espresso based coffee here is very consistent their house blend called four chairs is a lovely mix of earthy vegetal chocolatey flavours balanced with a hit of floral acidic citrus pairs fantastically with food which they do not have another thing they lack is seats the coffee bar is standing space only with just a scattering of chairs is the corners they also do drip coffee for which they use the kalita wave filter the drip lineup is constantly rotating based on whatever seasonal single origin beans that they personally source import and roast in house its not the most comfortable coffee place but its always cosy despite their adherence to the purity of the brew staff are never snooty and always ready to offer assistance and chat up customers if you cannot tell already i am a huge fan and i hope you will be one too,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,i was quite impressed with the coffee of nylon coffee roasters it is a cute and quaint shop with a very intimate set up would have been nice if there were more seating accommodations it was inconvenient to stand around i guess that is how hipster places are though but i can definitely see myself dropping by here again and bringing along a friend or two,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,this charming hole in the wall serves up caffeine in copious amounts if that is what you need i had just returned from nyc in may and was on the lookout for places that were both accessible and did drip coffee really well and nylon was it they are a short walk from outram nel exit g i came for the coffee but stayed for the conversations once you let the owners infect you with their love for coffee i guarantee you will be coming back for more for starters pick up a oz single shot and if you can i encourage you not to add any sugar to it to appreciate how the milk and espresso complement each other if you are looking to start brewing drip coffee at home they also carry a couple options the disposable kantan drip or the kalita wave,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,believe it or not there is a coffee culture in singapore that or i have a strange ability to befriend people and find a job where people are obsessed about their coffee and it is creeping up on me too damnit i have heard so many things about this place and i was always curious to try it out one day after a nice lunch around keong saik road my colleagues asked if i wanted some coffee they probably mentioned where we were going but i pulled a barney stinson and kind of zoned out once we approached this hdb flat i was thinking where the hell are we going and then we landed at nylon and i was like oh if i recall correctly nylon is story goes a little something like this they started out as a roaster and distributed coffee to different shops then they decided to open their shop to people and start serving coffee and every now and then they will shut the shop down for an uncertain amount of time to travel to places find and buy coffee beans then roast them in singapore so when you come in order and see them do cool things like weigh grinds for each drink you know that your cuppa is gonna be a good one and most recently they bought the space next door to them so now they opened it up and added a long table for you to enjoy your that cuppa even more the prices put starbucks to shame welcome to the new age,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,when my favorite cafe shut down last year i went into a deep dark spiral until i found nylon on doctor is orders i am temporarily cut off from coffee and alcohol so i have not been by since the renovations and expansion but god i love their espresso ah and dennis jiamin are great except i find watching dennis foam milk depressing he makes it look too damn easy to get such good sweet microfoam i seriously do not order flat whites from nylon because then i just cannot enjoy the flat whites i make at home what i find so impressive is that besides their excellent four chairs espresso blend they manage to regularly rotate through single origins and still serve consistently good espressos at home i am terrible at dialing in new coffees and there is another cafe near me that switches up their coffee quite often and i think they are terrible with their consistency while i can occasionally appreciate the mouth puckering super acidic lighter roasts that seems favored by many third wave roasters i am grateful that nylon so far has not gone there with any of the coffees i have tried a tip if you are buying beans order in advance online in store stock is pretty limited,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,i have read many good reviews on nylon coffee roasters and i finally got the chance to try it today all the praises awarded to the coffee by nylon coffee roasters are not exaggerated and definitely not misplaced it is a tiny stall hidden in a corner of everton park estate it is around a  minute walk from outram mrt station but that short walk is definitely worth the coffee you get at nylon coffee roasters i had a  oz flat white and have to say that it is by far my favourite cup of coffee on this island the main focus of nylon coffee roasters is their coffee and the owner is passion for brewing it right so do not expect fancy cafe styled cakes or a variety of flavours in their coffee their coffee are just that good on its own the owners who serve up the coffee on their own are warm and full of enthusiasm when you talk to them about their brew i am definitely heading back there some time soon,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,i am amazed and impressed with coffee shop in singapore the two coffee places we have been so far are so good the menu here is simple and i ordered the  oz since i generally prefer latte i think the coffee is a bit more sour than the other one i had yesterday at another nearby shop cute place and with friendly service i will definitely come back again,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,you know they mean business when there is a k la marzocco in the front and a probat at the back simply stated they roast their beans right my current crush is the baroida single origin warm chocolatey and fruity aftertaste can coffee descriptions rival that of wine possibly i was looking for a replacement for my usual san diego micro roaster and i first wandered in here when the storefront was open for under a year and they only occupied a single unit things were more quiet then they have since expanded to occupy the unit next door and there is a larger table standing room only weekends are crowded to put things in perspective if you are used to starbucks coffee bean type sugary concoctions there is none of that here you are not going to get sugar to go with your oz coffee coffee like this is a bit of an acquired taste it is a little like buying expensive headphones if you cannot hear the difference between the sennheisers and the  sonys perhaps it is not worth dropping the dollars on the former i cannot tell the difference for wine but i can for the coffee and the headphones i look forward to buy more beans by the bagful dennis jiamin keep doing your thing p s i saw dr leslie tay of ieatishootipost fame in the store one weekend and i was told it was his first visit there and he does not really drink coffee,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,i remember when i first stepped foot here i asked my colleague are you sure this is a caf where are the seats but that is just the concept of the place no seats you just need to stand around one high and long table the staffs here are evidently experienced baristas they are very quick and seemingly experts in their crafts they sell coffee beans and all although i have never stayed for coffee here before always just takeaways probably the idea of standing around a crowded table just does not appeal to me,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,located at the bottom of a hdb block nylon coffee is the epitome of no frills dennis and jiamin are champion coffee roasters who venture out into the wild to bring the best beans home to roast for you lucky people loved the pour overs here mostly made with the kalita wave when i went they had a guest bean in the hopper from the coffee collective in denmark probably the best coffee in singapore some say jb cannot reiterate how much i love this quaint little spot,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,as one of the earliest coffee joints to surface nylon coffee roasters is also one of the earliest cafes to set up within everton park with limited seating space when they started out they have since expanded to include a big communal table and a few more seats their research laboratory where they experiment with different coffee beans the oz white coffee   is made using their own four chairs blend that provides a creamy and balanced taste the coffee tasted milky while still maintaining the strong taste being a roaster their coffee beans and blends can be found in other cafes as well if you are around the cbd everton park tanjong pagar area why not visit their main shop instead,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,an adorable hole in the wall coffee spot that proves my theory that the world is best coffee is always hidden singapore is friendly resident community manager marcus introduced us to this charmer thank you and it did an excellent job of impressing two melbournian coffee fiends we were really blown away by the warm community feel of this place despite it is size happy punters crammed in for as long as possible to talk all things coffee with locals and visitors alike wonderful,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,this place is small and by small there is a counter and space to seat perhaps  people comfortably inside there is also a bit more space to accommodate the invariably long line of people waiting for their fix doubt their existence is much of a secret i think there is a wooden block outside but seems a bit unseemly to drink gourmet coffee on a wooden block hey different strokes anyway be prepared to get your coffee to go when you come here having said that the coffee  is delicious i drink my coffee black so even the smallest nuances in make a significant difference and these guys really know what they are doing i hear they travel frequently to hand pick the beans they also roast their beans in this giant monstrosity of a machine you will see inside my beans were from michiti a co op located in kaffa west ethiopia so damn good man just thinking about it is bringing back my unassuaged craving brb getting coffee,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,after reading the consistently great reviews about nylon this place was bookmarked for quite a while in my yelp list the first time i went there the roaster was closed today was attempt number  you can imagine the anticipation and great expectation when i finally got to try out their coffee this afternoon it was a tiny place with less than  seats indoors and filled with regulars overflowing onto the outdoor benches mostly young upper middle class singaporeans the guys were fit and the women were pretty hey not a bad place if you want to view local beautiful people having their saturday afternoon kopi we ordered a double shot macchiato each which while decent isnt quite the best i have had in singapore it was very creamy great if your personal preference and the flavor was strong and smooth but instead of being bitter the taste of the macchiato was literally sour i am not a coffee connoisseur yet i have never come across great coffee being described as sour the best macchiato i have had here is at liberty coffee a roaster that sporadically opens during seemingly random weekends comparing nylon and liberty the latter offers bitter expresso with a light dash of milk that also goes down smoothly with a strong nutty roast aftertaste for coffee i know which place i prefer for the view nylon is imcomparable,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,complete focus on coffee and it shows they do not have food or even much in the way of seating but their absolute focus on coffee makes it all worth it i had a single espresso and it was absolutely brilliant sweet and well rounded with loads of flavour coming through nice people too who have clearly spent some time around coffee and know all the world is best spots,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,so having actually been in nylon twice now i have to say dropping by really is such an big part of its charm you meet people that are happy to talk to you about absolutely anything and everything willing to share the joke that has you walking in mid laugh and often perfectly happy to offer up the seat if you are stuck holding your coffee and looking awkward it is the kind of place you wish you could drop by every day to become a regular yourself just so you can be part of the in group also i do not think the lack of seating space is a big deal there are actually benches outside and if you do not mind the heat then win so yes i am bumping this up to five stars it is really hard to not love the charm warmth and inclusiveness of a place like nylon,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,first coffee shop that i have been to here that smells right mmmm roastery the place is cozy and moderrn the coffee is fantastic pour overs are apparently hard to find here and this place is legit i have been jonesing for some good coffee and i found it here proper check it out,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,you know how there are some places you just want to keep secret from the crowds this coffee place is one of them then the fear if no one knows or goes then it would go out of biz it turns out from my ig that nylon is so popular that is cos their coffee is soooo awesome i hate burnt beans love a strong cuppa too their cold white coffee is just great not diluted by the ice just fab,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,excellent coffeshop tasty beans roasted to perfection interesting variety extremely good service friendly professional delicious coffee to drink i love the standing table and the setting under an hdb cannot be beat great place all around,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,a great place to have coffee personable service small area and two incredibly passionate individuals who have travelled the world over to experience the wonders of coffee all over and have come to share it with us the coffees are of a very high quality loads of flavour fruity and complex and always a surprise or two here and there their el primero blend is the house blend and is seasonal only way to find out what the flavours are for that day is to hop down for a tasting nylon however is relatively small not much of a spot for sitting down over a table the entire day there are no tables in fact hence it would not be ideal for that purpose but for the coffee purist is paradise no food here either,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,this place is coffee geek heaven these guys know their coffee and it shows i had a perfect cup of coffee and pleasing me when it comes to my coffee is no small feat if you are into grande soy pumpkin spiced half caff blah blah blah then this is probably not the place for you but if you truly appreciate your coffee in it is purist form then you belong here lack of seating is a huge bummer especially when you consider how long it can take for your drink to be prepared hopefully they find a larger space in the future,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,i had the iced pour over coffee and it was perfect the place is tiny with only a few seats available but it is a lovely place to get your quick caffeine fix the service was attentive friendly swift i would definitely recommend this place to any coffee lovers especially if you are a local for those visiting singapore this place could be a tad difficult to find it is well hidden in one of the housing areas hdb but i would say it is worth the trip even when it was pouring rain,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,we participated in a third wave roasted coffee exchange last year nylon coffee roasters sent beautifully roasted coffee we enjoyed it here at rsthaus coffee in texas thanks for your sharing you talent with us,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,another one of your typical pretentious coffee joints i much prefer just want coffee couple meters away since when did schooling your customers on coffee become a thing thanks but no thanks,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,here is where you know you will always get a great cup of specialty coffee whether brewed or as an espresso drink i always start my coffee rounds with a cold brew that is a small dose of intense flavour approximately  ounces if you head down there anytime soon you might just taste the same juicy berry flavour profile of this current single origin bean that leaves you craving for more on any given day in this sweltering heat of singa i thoroughly enjoy interacting with the couple behind the machine a friendly duo who are very serious about their java ask them about their shop name if you have the chance they have quite a sweet story behind it oh and do not forget to check out the little touches around the pigeon hole tiny as it may be many interesting accessories are lying around,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,i wish my hdb block had a nylon coffee roaster at the void deck i would be greeted by wafts of dizzying coffee smell everyday i would even get my daily dose of coffee here everyday if i could went to check out this tiny space with a friend of mine and we both ordered the piccolo if i am not wrong they were brewing peruvian beans for the coffee that day it was so good and so smooth we did not add a grain of sugar the coffee is gentle enough that the milk is sweetness cuts through and you get to enjoy a real cup of coffee was so in love with it that i wanted to get the beans so i can make a cup with my french press at home every day but their shelf of freshly roasted beans which they do in house you can see the machine behind the counter had only the brazillian blend so i got that and they ground it for me just tell them how you make your coffee at home whether its espresso machine french press or drips and they can grind the coffee accordingly for you while the beans were grinding oh my the beautiful bittersweet aroma that suddenly enveloped the room got us all so excited it was nice talking to the owners too because they really do love their coffee and are happy to share their expertise do not expect a cafe though this is strictly a coffee lab joint space it is all coffee and nothing else final verdict worth hunting for not just for the freshly ground coffee but also to meet the genuine and passionate owners,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,nylon is a rather tiny place with essentially no tables sitting so do not expect to really hang out comfortably here i know close to zero about coffee making but i think that probat machine they have in the back room looks pretty cool like it is the heart core of their operations one of the very few coffee places that are open on mondays along with stranger is reunion and toby is estate parking you will see many cars parked illegally around the back of the blocks not sure how safe it is so i usually park at the multi storey behind which anyway has a linkway level b i think straight to nylon,Negative
nylon-coffee-roasters,a macbook hooked up to a roaster to profile the temp and a bunch of other stuff to make sure your coffee is right cannot go wrong,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,nylon coffee roasters is situated in everton park which is a mere  minute walk from outram mrt and is hidden by a row of retro and old slighly rundown hdb shophouses the coffee shop is partitioned into two with one end occupied by a professional looking coffee maker and the other end with only four seats the coffee flat white oz for  tastes extremely unique and different from the usual coffee joints perhaps because their unique blend is hand roasted indoors you can also buy the beans they have handroasted for your own personal consumption it is definitely worth travelling to this slightly out of the way place to try their unique roast,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,what can i say about this place you put lovely co owners with mean coffee making skills a good machine i love vintage a quaint location and you will get the quirks of a good coffee spot we did not get to catch much because there was a sudden wave of people coming in that is quite scary considering how small the place is but everyone seemed to find their space but we managed to get ourselves each a cup of capp well pulled none of the bitter aftertaste and a good creaminess to it i will head back on days when there are desserts,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,so first thing first this is not a cafe so after our stint at strangers reunion we decided to explore a little since nylon coffee roasters is relatively near by foot from kampong bahru well it is not relatively that near but we made it under the hot sun over to the charming little hdb estate of everton park we were quite confused as to which block it was but managed to find it after a bit of wandering you will never expect anything in here if you do not know where to look that is the most important thing you need to know about nylon coffee roasters they sell coffee but they do not sell a space with couches comfortable chairs and tables if you want that go to starbucks it is as it is name suggests a coffee roaster place what they do is to transform their love for coffee into a shop front for other like minded people to enjoy some indie beans if you see the window in the photo that has something behind it is actually the other half of the shop with a giant roasting machine inside you can buy the beans they roasted which all comes with very exotic names which i cannot pronounce or recall or you can grab a cuppa to go or have it at the storefront which only has  chairs so really just grab a to go the owners are really friendly though and ready to share their knowledge for coffee if you are interested,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,good people who love and know coffee one of the best in singapore the space is small but very inviting to enjoy your coffee,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,tiny place but high in quality great taste these guys love their coffee they weigh every shot,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,so im not an expert in coffee and i have zero experience in it im a starbucks toffee nut latte kinda girl but i love this place because i love how the place is such a homely and non pretentious area unlike new f b spots that ride on new trends there is what  chairs there and everyone just stands around and have talks about anything under the sun and dennis jiamin owners entertain my incessant questions about coffee and brewing which i am really thankful for so if you feel like you need to come home to some coffee and just chill come talk to the people at nylon you would not regret it,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,the good quaint space happy customers reasonable prices and good coffee the bad i know i am going to get roasted for this pun intended but the above is the list of all the good things about nylon nothing more nothing less feels like you are walking into someone is kitchen so depending on whether you like that feel it could be good or bad took me awhile to locate the shop as it is buried beneath a hdb block by the time i got there the last thing i wanted was something hot because singapore is hot i came with a friend and we both ordered the recommended coffee iced drinks came out in a timely manner and we both intently sipped them outside because there were already  people inside i e packed house my friend thought her drink was a bit bitter so she flagged down one of the staff for some sugar their response have you tasted it god bless that pretentious barista i thought to myself as i nearly spat out a mouthful of my iced bean from somewhere interesting coffee for the first time in awhile i was transported straight to williamsburg brooklyn if you do not know google it the ugly they deal strictly with coffee so right there i have a cap of  stars i am not a huge coffee fan and by that i mean i drink   cups a day from various local spots and chains is nylon coffee good yes is it better than the rest maybe can anyone really tell probably not therefore unless this place was on my way to work i would not make it a destination with nothing to eat and nowhere to sit i would prefer any other cafe around the way i am so annoyed at bean snobs coffee cults i just made those up that i am borderline close to organizing a blind taste test just to prove that coffee is as much about climate sensation and temper as it is about taste to put it another way the best tasting meals are when you are hungry so in short people crave the experience plus caffeine cannot forget about the spectacular drug caffeine,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,fave cuppa but the sad thing in here is you cant just sit down n enjoy the coffee as the plc is really really small,Negative
nylon-coffee-roasters,great coffee period the atmosphere was friendly and everyone just ended up chatting together so rare these days the prices are reasonable so what more can you wish for,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,lovely hole in the wall coffee place which has a nice ambience and indie feel to it yes the seats are limited inside but who is stopping you from buying a cuppa coffee and sitting on some of the benches outside grab pastries from the nearby bakery whilst you are at it,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,to be honest i find this place a little pretentious the coffee is good but not exceptional they are not the only serious guys making good coffee these days one can quite easily find legitimate coffee elsewhere these days however i think what sets this cafe apart is the strong community of coffee connoisseurs and lovers if you like sipping and discussing your coffee with other like minded folks or enjoy feeling indie and ironic with your cup of coffee in the hdb heartlands this might be the place for you,Positive
nylon-coffee-roasters,great coffee friendly owners and nice cafe hidden gem kinda vibe the prices are low too compared to many other indie coffee places and esp against the big coffee chains one of the best in singapore i go there at least once a fortnight there are other good coffee places ard my work area too,Positive
burnt-ends,take all my money after a  hour flight to singapore i was eagerly awaiting my lunch at burnt ends i basically opted out of all the flight food skipped breakfast and ended up ordering the chef is menu at lunch for burnt ends the outcome i have never been so full in my life since my husband and i decided to let our chefs dictate our menu i am not actually sure how many dishes we consumed that were a part of the regular menu items that were stellar standouts any of the beef cuts cooked to perfection the maitake mushroom with egg and rice the whole crab and of course the sanger by the time the sanger showed up we had consumed  dishes beforehand i wish i had another stomach so that i could have enjoyed the sanger even more getting dessert seemed impossible but we agreed to try the marshmallow and while it was only a bite it was also delicious as people have mentioned this place does require having a reservation and i know it is tough for folks in the us to secure one with the time difference we also wanted to sit at the counter which adds another complexity to procuring a reservation keep in mind that you will also be in close quarters with your neighbors if i am in singapore again i will definitely come back,Positive
burnt-ends,burnt ends is one of the toughest places to get a seat in singapore i had to book months in advance after failing to get a reservation on my other visits to singapore it has been consistently ranked in the top  asia restaurants list and went all the way up to number ten this year i was super excited to finally have a chance to get a table here overall i really enjoyed my meal here and had some great food mixed with pretty good food the pricing is on the high end and definitely expect to pay over sgd per person here food   starsservice   starsenvironment   starsoverall   starsrecommendations garlic shoots tenderloin with bone marrow sauce jet chicken wingsthe wait staff here was really attentive and my waiter helped me work through the menu st item smoked quail egg with caviar nice taste but really not worth the  sgd the caviar did not really add anything and i would not order this again nd item smoked jerk chicken wings were really tasty two small chicken wings but they were juicy and the lime crema was a nice touch rd item burnt ends sanger was a really well executed pulled pork sandwich the black sesame bun was nice soft and well toasted the cole slaw was well dressed and maintained its crunch and provided a nice texture contrast to the soft pork shoulder the pork was good for the most part but some parts were a bit on the dry side th item garlic shoots and gremolata is a must order the gremolata is delicious and the garlic sprouts were really nice first time i had this at a non chinese restaurant highly recommended th item tenderloin with bone marrow and smoked onion sauce is the signature dish of the restaurant and i can see why tenderloin is really one of my least favorite cuts of steak but man oh man is it really good here nice and red on the inside without being chewy that bone marrow and burnt onion sauce is awesome the side salad also provided some freshness to the dish and made it feel less heavy must order th item pumpkin pie with marshmallow ice cream the pumpkin pie has a nice crust and is not too overly sweet the ice cream however has chunks of marshmallows in it which i really did not like and gave the dish a weird chewy textured it also made the dessert steer towards the too sweet end would try the fog pavolova next time instead,Positive
burnt-ends,i get the hype with the experimental drinks and the different types of meat cuts but i just could not get into it the starters we had were caviar sea bass tacos meat toasted i would come back for the sea bass spread but not so much the meat there was to on the meat which is what brought me down a loot since  of our meat was fat the caviar was great and even with a teaspoon i would come back for that the drink were ok but of you are going out with friends who do not drink then they sadly might have a heard,Negative
burnt-ends,this is one of our favorite spots in the world service was excellent food is to die for the best ingredients perfectly cooked the blackmore ribeye was insane and also really loved the marron also enjoyed the salt pepper ribs and the quail egg w caviar cannot wait to eat here again next time in singapore,Positive
burnt-ends,excellent service and food difficult to get a table as there is limited seating with an open kitchen the wine is kinda expensive with aussie wines on the list the leek with hazelnuts is a treat different lamb cigar is a small bite size treat and the big deal was blackmore cube roll which was excellent well worth a visit,Positive
burnt-ends,it was a night that i will never forget this was one of those nights where you said treat yo self and boy was i ready to do that at burnt ends this restaurant is the hot ticket top rankings great reviews popular amongst locals and tourists so i was extremely excited to have the opportunity to dine at this restaurant since i wanted to treat myself i went and ordered the chefs select the best part of this was that i was able to eat at the chefs counter just to sit there and watch every chef showcase their skills and techniques it was a dream you get to see the creativity and the innovation behind every dish as it gets prepared you get to see the quality of the ingredients and the precision of this well oiled team of chefs i will be honest there were some moments where you questioned yourself for a bit because some dishes looked way too simple for example there was a dish where it looked like a grilled cracker with a crema and topped with a ton of chives but once you take a bite your mind is blown my favorite was their interpretation of steak and potatoes and the leeks with brown butter hazelnuts these were just the favorites but i truly loved every dish and wished i had more after every bite if you are looking for a michelin star restaurant with a cool vibe this one is it i highly recommend this place to any traveler that is coming through,Positive
burnt-ends,our favorite restaurant in the world it is just that good simple preparation of the best ingredients that money can buy cooked over wood by an incredibly talented team i wish this chef would open something a little closer to home but i am happy to travel to the other side of the world every couple of years for an incredibly memorable meal the blackmore ribeye here is definitely our favorite steak of all team,Positive
burnt-ends,i have nothing else to say other than this was an amazing experience make sure you get proper seating the experience can change your meal got the beef marmalade my god the bbq sauce was warm tangy and just perfect the beef itself was also amazing ofc we then got the pork shoulder sand which this had less emphasis on sauce and the meat quality really stood out we then got a burnt onion steak g and that was good as well i would not rave home about it but definitely good the next star was the ribeye g wow that quality of meat of amazing they just add a little salt to it and it was ridiculously good the pieces that did not have any salt flakes were disappointing in contrast to the well seasoned parts beef marmalade and ribeye were must gets here,Positive
burnt-ends,to the owner read pls readwow what an amazing dining experience i absolutely loved everything about this place except well let me get to that part first lets talk about what is most important at hand food how i got in i came here early on a saturday night because this place is booked online all the way until august i was told if you come early they accept walk ins opens at  but come at pm what i did not know was you would probably have to eat outside mind you eating outside in singapore is not so pleasant because it is so hot and humid but i wanted to take my chances the reviews i got from a couple i met said that this place is far better than most in california so my palate needed to see what the fuss was about anyways we got lucky and there was a cancellation and we got to sit inside service it was amazing the staff there are so nice helpful and just know what to recommend they were knowledgeable about the menu and most importantly they were attentive from empty water glasses to needing ice cubes they were on point i never had to wait to get anyone is attention spot on food loved the grissini and taramasalata lite airy with a soft creamy and crispy texture and the little chives gave it an added flavor leek hazelnut and brown butter yummy not a fan of leeks and the layers it breaks into but the thin buttery notes with a hazelnut makes a perfect pair beef marmalade and house pickle yasss sweet savory tender crispy crunchy with sour crunchy pickles oh my it is like a pull pork but way way way better a definite must try g  day dry aged blacksmores cube roll enough for two if you got all of the above best steak i have ever had hands down the beef was perfectly marbled and the meat so tender i ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly still melted in my mouth and the course salt was sprinkled on just right it also comes with a vinaigrette salad perfect to clean your palate in between bites so why why  stars honestly i was torn on whether or not to take a star then on my way home i thought maybe i should take  to get their attention but the food was too good to give them  out of  anyways it is so sad that such a wonderful restaurant can be ruined because the owner could not put down his phone during the whole  hours i was there he was texting and surfing social media in between preparing our meals i was a bit grossed out when i saw that because he touches food with his bare hands then goes to his phone and then continues to prepare food not once did he wash his hands do you know how dirty your phone is we place it everywhere take it to the restroom set it on tables and everything else how often does anyone sanitize their phones i do pretty often since i work in a hospital but it was soooo disappointing disgusting to see that the owner should be focused on how successful his place is and how happy everyone is enjoying the food he created not texting sadly enough i was not the only one who noticed another woman mentioned it after she finished her meal i hope he was receptive to that cause i would not want others to experience that would i come back yes but if i saw anyone on their phones while preparing my food i would not  for a unsanitized meal would not be worth it no matter how good it is,Positive
burnt-ends,i spent a recent saturday evening having dinner with a couple of friends who live in singapore and who have been raving about burnt ends for years burnt ends is an amazing restaurant serving grilled meats and seafood prepared over hot charcoal to diners seated along a long bar enjoying the show in addition burnt ends offers a wide range of cocktails and a prodigious wine list the sommelier is as passionate about wines as any sommelier that i have met you should take the time to have a chat with him if you are seeking a great bottle of wine i have included photos of the menu and the dishes that my friends and i had for dinner the beef marmalade is a highlight and a must do the miso eggplant is an unexpectedly delicious dish that should also be tried the steaks that i had were amazing although i am sure that anything offered on the menu will be delicious the most unique pairing of the evening was a jalapeo bourbon shot with a pickle juice back paired with the pulled pork sanger it was delicious i would be remiss if i did not mention the amazing service by everyone at burnt ends from the hostess to the wait staff to the sommelier burnt ends is the real deal and a complete package it should be on everyone is short list when dining out in singapore,Positive
burnt-ends,this was my first trip to singapore and i was consumed with trying the local food i had heard so much about the hawkers some of them even have michelin stars and of course i had to eat at a couple peranakan restaurants so it was not until our last night in singapore that we made it to burnt ends i can honestly say it was the best meal we had in singapore they are doing something special at burnt ends the roasted peeks in brown butter the smoked quail egg with caviar the steak tartare with caviar on a hash brown the white pepper chicken necks and the bone marrow bun were all amazing we did not even get an entree the small dishes were good enough i am looking forward to returning and trying one of their steaks i also thoroughly enjoyed the slow gin negroni is for dessert the pineapple rum sabayon was also a nice way to end things the service staff was cool too we enjoyed their conversation and they were very informative burnt ends is doing something not many restaurants are doing anywhere in the world they are deserved of all the accolades they receive,Positive
burnt-ends,burnt ends is the best place i have eaten in singapore the eel and bone marrow bite is one of the best things i have ever eaten we ate the chef is select which turned out to be almost everything on the menu this ended up being incredibly expensive especially with wine which had a serious like everywhere else in singapore markup but still worth every penny highlights sanger was delicious eel and bone marrow was phenomenal you will never forget eating this the crab was fantastic especially with sourdough to mop up the sauce burnt ends chocolate fondant was special gooey but burnt and crisp in the very best way the somm was charming gave us wonderful reccs and even served us a half bottle when he would normally only serve a full service was impeccable an institution for the best reasons,Positive
burnt-ends,nothing much to add to the reviews here but this is as amazing as it gets get the beef marmalade and bone marrow burger and of course a steak,Positive
burnt-ends,yum yum and yum burnt ends was a fabulous meal in singapore we tried making reservations starting a month out and everything was booked we were bummmed but figured we would still give it a shot when we were in town we were able to walk right in with no wait we were seated at the high top tables but if we had chosen to wait an hour we could have had regular seating as well if you are in town without reservations i would still give it a shot bc it was so worth it if you have a choice go with the table top seating you can watch the magic happen cocktails were phenomenal one has burnt sage on top super fragrant and we really loved the small plates and sharable plates the jacobs ladder meat from between the ribs was fatty and delicious and had a great mustard sauce the jerk chicken with the citrus cream sauce was also fabulous the pulled pork sandwich was huge and had a ton of flavor the king crab with brown butter was a delicious main course decent amount of crab and the butter sauce also had capers yum we are so glad we took a shot and were able to walk in and experience this place on our one night in singapore,Positive
burnt-ends,this is one of the most disappointing experiences i have had in singapore as well as dining at the worlds is top  when your reservation that you make  months in advance says bar seating what they really mean is wall seating your seat is an uncomfortable bar stool at an iron grate shelf facing a wall when we asked if there was any other options the hostess rudely stated that was what our reservations were made for fine seat us then our cocktails were weak and when we asked for a dirty martini we were told they only brine they had in the restaurant was jalapeo brine we tried several starters grissinni simple and tasty jerk chicken pass it was a super fatty piece of chicken smeared in mayo and the beef marmalade which was the best dish we sampled the marmalade was delicious we also tried the sanger sandwich while good it was missing an element of flavor maybe some spice could highlight the flavors and last we were recommended to try the venison unfortunately the venison was brought out with little actual meat and instead a huge bone that apparently accounted for the majority of the weight that we paid for i expect more at this price point and for the hype what a huge disappointment save your money and get some actual quality food elsewhere i would have preferred roasted meat from a hawker stall,Negative
burnt-ends,very nice australian cuisine booking is essential we booked  months ahead and managed to only get a bar seat that means you sit facing the blank wall on a bar stool not the best for a social outing the food was good and so was the service i found it a bit rich we started off with the quails egg caviar followed by grissini taramasalata both good the beef marmalade and leek hazelnut truffle were also good i found the pulled pork burger ordinary the king crab and garlic brown butter was excellent but rich the final dish of onglet was also nice over all it was a nice meal although most uncomfortable on a bar stool,Positive
burnt-ends,i love dining alone and this night i happened to walk in at just the right time to catch one of the last seats available for dinner it was outside which was fine as it was a cool march evening i saw many people being turned away after i sat down i ordered the miso eggplant the romaine salad the steak and a mint ice cream for dessert this was a bit too much food for one i realized late but it was fabulous i specifically asked the waiter for the smallest cut of steak and he recommended it be done medium rare which i do not usually do but it was so so so good the steak comes with a small salad so the romaine salad was really unnecessary it would have been helpful if the waiter had told me the romaine was the least successful of the items it was strangely salty make the time for this place when you are in singapore,Negative
burnt-ends,my favourite restaurant in singapore burnt ends gets it all right the meat and seafood will blow your socks off dishes that at first appear super simple are after diving in deeply complex this started with snow crab leg in herb butter roasted leek eggplant and then moved on to the burnt ends sanger amazing rump cap sounds like a lot for two but the dishes are small and perfect to share we finished with the sugar cake and smoked ice cream the cocktails and wines are phenomenal but it is the experience and theatre going on in the kitchen as you sit at the bar that seals the deal go here yeah it is not cheap but it should not be,Positive
burnt-ends,wow wow   amazing phenomenal delicious mouth watering an experience you cannot miss if you do not go you messed up,Positive
burnt-ends,there are times when you do pay lots for a meal and leaving the place feeling worth every single cents i would say this is the place every thing from the food the service and the ambiance was just wonderful we were lucky enough to get the seats closes to where the action is seeing how the order comes in the sou chef calling out the orders the busy cooks scrambling to get every piece perfect and back to the chef finally taste to serve think there are more than enough reviews already will just add extremely detail pictures to tempt whose unconvinced to part with their hard earn so i wo not say more except the g beef though a s  hit was the best also a surprise was that the dessert was good too you would think bbq guys cannot do desserts think again great job guys just go ahead and include  no need to put a big note and hint of no service charge you deserve every cent of it do not be shy as you are not on your qs my son loved their food and decide to do a video of them youtu be jawatyz ce,Positive
burnt-ends,my husband and i had the pleasure of dining here during our visit to singapore after reading so much about it prior to our visit in our nerdy tourist book we felt it is a definite must try we read many reviews about how difficult it is to get a reservation here indeed i tried calling a couple times from our hotel and no luck i think it may be an online reservation only not sure anyways we took our chances on a wednesday evening to just walk in and hopefully the wait would not be too long when we arrived the hostess said it would be  minutes by the bar area against the wall the bar area by the kitchen is definitely more appealing to the eyes as you can see the chefs and bartender working their magic the restaurant itself is quite small so i can understand why it is difficult to get seated here we strolled around the streets a bit and returned  minutes later there were  seats by the bartender vacant at this point but the hostess said it is reserved we waited a little longer but the guests by the wall bar were still seated the hostess then informed us that the party that was to be seated by the bartender canceled so we got some pretty good seats there we ordered a couple drinks and the bartender was a true artist at his craft some of the best drinks we have ever had we ordered  appetizers which came out promptly one after the other each one was more delicious than the one before my husband had ordered a steak which came out quite late at that point we almost did not even wait for it that is why i docked off a star from my review sadly we did not feel that the steak was nearly as special as the appetizers which were truly the star of the dining experience the lamb tacos and the beef marmalade were our favorites we also liked the pulled pork sandwich nonetheless the dining experience was truly memorable and i recommend you pay this place a visit people were complaining about prices in their reviews but coming from la it really was not too different it was actually cheaper than a lot of the fine dining we have had in la my advice would be to skip on the steaks and order a bunch of their delicious meat appetizers,Negative
burnt-ends,the restaurant was tiny in size with about  counter seat  bar seats and chef table which could seat  the day before i checked its website and was able to make a reservation for its counter seat as i was one of its first customers of the day i was able to get the first seat next to the cashier with a great view of the open kitchen smoked quail egg and caviar  gone in a mouthful it was an exciting moment in the mouth although one could not help feeling that it was quite expensive for an egg duck hearts and peri peri  i was not quite a fan of duck hearts and expecting it to be quite spicy but it tasted chewy with a hint of spices beef marmalade and pickles  very nice with the freshly cooked marmalade on the toast but a tab messy to eat burnt ends sanger  pulled pork shoulder cole slaw chipotle aioli brioche buni had this takeaway after looking at most other customers having it it was huge and packs lots of meat in it with lots of flavours in it almost could not finished it onglet burnt onion and bone marrow   i like that the steak was served sliced which made it easy to eat with a fork i was not a fan of bone marrow due to its gel like appearance but it tasted great with the meat berry tart  it was the dessert item of the day served with chantilly cream although i wish there was vanilla ice cream to go with it looked simple it tasted quite good without too tart i like the part just before the crust which gave a kind of chewy bite overall food was great although the counter seats were full the place was not too noisy and just nice for a meal,Positive
burnt-ends,i had a great meal here on a friday evening i made my mandatory reservation  months in advance for a back counter seat i got lucky when i showed up for my pm reservation and was told a seat at the front counter watching the kitchen was not needed until pm score it was fabulous watching the staff work like a well oiled machine i started with a delicious whisky drink and then had the smoked quail egg with caviar the smokiness was lovely then i had the meat marmalade minus the aioli as i am not a fan of aioli yummy pork belly with apple and raspberry pure yum and the leeks omg good it was all outstanding and let me tell you get the leeks they were buttery and had hazelnuts and were chargrilled i still remember what they taste like just go and eat some for me,Positive
burnt-ends,even though i have heard so much about this restaurants it took me almost a year before my husband chanced upon it while looking for late night supper we were greeted by servers with a strong australian accent howdy mate and saw that the restaurant was still packed at pm we managed to get the last two seats at the counter basically the entire restaurant are counter seats and was told that only the pulled pork burger was available as their restaurant was closed so that saved us from making choices my husband then asked if they had fries since i wanted some with my burger sadly the kitchen was closing so they did not have any but we got the beef marmalade instead in short food was amazing the beef marmalade was remarkable shredded beef in wondrous flavor on a crispy piece of bread pulled pork burger is probably a good portion for a main meal but perfect when we shared it for supper the flavors were again a delight to my tastebuds but i have to be honest the pulled pork could be a little more tender probably a   execution for the burger and   for the beef marmalade we also ordered a smoky cocktail the bartender burnt the sage it was lightly sweet and not overwhelmingly strong a great experience overall and i am definitely curious to be back to try their other main dishes which by the way rotates frequently reservations are only taken for dinner seating between  pm and walk ins usually have an hour to two wait or you could wing it like us come by for a late night supper dish,Positive
burnt-ends,dinner tip go line up a little bit before they open at p spots are gone in  minutes put your name down and come back when they call you,Positive
burnt-ends,this place was amazing we were lucky to get in for lunch even though we had no reservation we showed up at  noon and waited in the area until   when they had room this was the best steak i have ever had the bartender was a kick and we had fucking hell bier from germany and finished with a fernet shot with the bartender my husband was not drinking so he has a girly no booze kiddy shot lol every thing we had was fantastic including the garlic shoots sourdough bread to mop up the extra sauce pork belly and the cube roll steak the berry tart and marshmallows were amazing as well this place is a do not miss and if i get all the way back to singapore will be the first reservation i make,Positive
burnt-ends,this place is so so so good great experience great service great food i cannot handle this place some must orders sanger alaskan king crab meat marmalade x plates it is that good jamaican ginger beerall the food comas following a meal here are worth it you have to trust me on this one,Positive
burnt-ends,you smell the food as you walk in open kitchen concept was also very cool nice to see your food prepared expertly and carefully by the chefs service staff was very attentive and also knew their product well which is always a a plus for me for my drink i ordered their rusty grains cocktail which is their very own barrel aged whiskey blend amazing flavor and aroma served simply in a whiskey glass with a nice big round ice ball my date ordered the happy ending which got a good laugh from the people next to me since i had to ask the female server for a happy ending but yea all in good fun ahahait appears that they must have a rotating menu judging from the fact that there was a date on the menu hehe tonight we tried the uni toast if it is there just try it apparently i was the first to order as it was brand new and it certainly did not disappoint uni spread on a wheat toast with some toasted seaweed oh man why cannot butter be this good of course we had to try some steak the server shows us the meat before the even grill it which was a nice touch we also had a squid pico de gallo and a pulled pork sand which definitely a great date place i will be coming back,Positive
burnt-ends,burnt ends is a spot that i walked in with extremely high expectations towards with recommendations coming from multiple fronts my gf and i dined at andre previously and burnt ends was mentioned highly even from their staff so we took the plunge and made the reservation preparing ourselves for eating some meat we had the early  pm seating on a wednesday so arrived right at  on the dot and had the first two counter seats the ambiance immediately strikes you as a cool and hip place with old school punk rock music playing and young chefs hailing the kitchen the open kitchen counter seating setting is always a plus allows you to watch and wow over the entire process from the moment you order your food to it being announced to preparation to cooking to serving each of their  visible chefs with different roles and stations totally makes for one incredible experience even before you taste your food we ordered the following  leek with hazelnut and black truffle nice tasting and perfectly grilled leek except was way too salty for my taste this is subjective yes but even in being lenient this was a bit much the black truffle was even overpowered by the salt  garlic shoots and gremolata great starter not too overwhelming of garlic  fennel orange and burrata loved the fennel and burrata but the the orange syrup was a bit too artificial tasting and did not seem to belong it took away from the freshness of the rest of the dish for me  burnt ends sanger pulled pork shoulder home made cole slaw home made chipotle aioli brioche bun loved this can eat  of these  suckling pig for  good but be prepared to work excellent flavor from the charcoal grill  burnt ends sourdough your typical sourdough overall the food was nice definitely worth a shot but unfortunately i was not wow would by any means the sanger was excellent and i am sure they can make a shop purely from these i also took a star off because of their lacking dessert and cocktail menus not sure if they are hoping people only eat and get out kinda thing but with the kind of setting that they have in there an awesome cocktail and creative dessert would go long ways to make the place and experience totally memorable otherwise i would recommend you check it out i know i will be back to checkout their new menus in the future,Negative
burnt-ends,disappointing it is just basic barbequed food all hype the spicy pulled pork burger smoked quail eggs are the best tasting items there are better places for steak than the dry charred overpriced steaks everything else is smoky barbequed food there is no innovation nothing evolves the seats are uncomfortable the layout is terrible as a bar counter type restaurant for conversations if your group is more than  service takes a hit when u need to order anything because only  waiters serve each end of the restaurant  end has a tiny table for a group of  to  to squeeze in sometimes only  waiter is seen and their manners are not friendly eg what u want instead of yes what would u like the restaurant also does not take reservations for timings later than pm bartender service was horrible we had already paid for the mediocre meal but my elderly parents that were  years old were still seated waiting for  guest to finish using the bathroom it was no more than a  minute wait and the bartender rudely said to my elderly parents what is going on as if we had overstayed our time in burntends when we had ordered several premium dishes that took a long time to serve i will never dine at this overrated restaurant with the poor service mediocre food it is worth  yelp star for the rude poor service the michelin guides must have inhaled too much smoke when they gave this place  star,Negative
burnt-ends,sadly a return visit in  was met with a mediocre reception seated outdoors due to not having a reservation my guest and i were forgotten for about  minutes when the staff realized that they had not provided us with menus having made the recommendation to dine at burnt ends to my dining companion i was sorely disappointed when the sanger meat consistency was more of a tuna sandwich other courses were quite frankly boring while i realize that burnt ends has made the recent top  restaurants in the world listing i felt well burned by our experience,Negative
burnt-ends,we went with the omakase style or rather my friend ordered the omakase so we managed to try out most of their dishes the restaurant seating are mostly counter seats and from there you can have a great view of the chefs scurrying across the kitchen preparing your meals sitting there also means you get a chance to interact with chef dave pynt and his extremely hot sous chef i think the only problem with an open kitchen as well as the background music was that i could not hear much when the chefs introduced the dishes for most of the dishes i did not even know the names really but what i can highly recommend the burnt ends sanger pulled pork burger it was extremely juicy and flavourful the only pity was that we had to share it among us friends i could eat the whole thing by myself for sure this is one of their signature dishes blackmore is cube roll i think this is steak that we ate done medium rare it was well grilled and seasoned and the quality of the meat was obvious the only con to this was the almost  price this is one of their signature dishes too alaskan king crab and garlic oh man the king crab was very well cooked over the garlic sauce the sauce was well prepared no taste of bitterness at all dip a piece of sourdough bread in it and devour it savour every last bit of the sauce surprisingly this is coming from a restaurant known for their meats if you have not eaten at burnt ends reservations as of this past weekend are filled till september talk about a long wait pros great view of the kitchen and chefs working amazing food really they are known for their meats good and warm service from both chefs and floor alikecons might be considered expensive our bill came up to about  per pax long reservation wait if you do manage to get it noisy restaurantant,Positive
burnt-ends,burnt ends proclaims itself as a modern australian bbq and the star of the show is certainly the grill and flaming oven but then again outback steak also proclaims itself as an australian steak house but the two comparisons could not be further apart thankfully in a modern and minimal room most of the seats are on the counter with a few tables in the back the menu follows the current trend where you list only the ingredients so for our first course it was simply listed as leeks hazelnut and brown butter and sure enough that is what we got but it was completely awesome the leeks were grilled perfectly and sweet and tender while the hazelnuts provided an excellent counter and all swimming in a rich yummy bath of brown butter the sanger was also one of the best sandwiches i have had in sg it is basically a pulled pork with cole slaw and aioli which was super messy but on par with some of the better bbq sandwiches i have had back in the states the lamb with harissa was good although my chop was a little grisly do get a steak even the cheapest version the onglet is very good it is basically a hanger steak that is grilled perfectly on the rarer side with bone marrow and a very rich sauce service is efficient and competent my only complaint is that i would not serve a belgian abbey ale in a tall glass but it is a minor issue and one that could be remedied with a wine glass not perfect but certainly an improvement over a tall glass anyway do make a reservation the place is small and fills up quickly even on a wednesday night and definitely try veggies as well as meats as they handle both deftly here and they also have quite a few barrel aged cocktails which i will definitely have to hit up next time the little plates can add up pretty quickly but it is definitely worth it,Positive
burnt-ends,this was our first night in singapore and we heard a lot of great things about burnt ends let me tell you it was excellent from beginning to end first of all the staff is incredible sheena who made our reservations was amazing she knew we were coming to celebrate our honeymoon and she made every effort to get us a seat at the main table she is so nice next the bartenders made some excellent drinks there was a new bartender there literally his first day but he was very polite and knowledgeable and was able to make the drinks we requested the head chef was super kind and came by personally to welcome us and made us a meal we wo not forget everything was perfect with the exception of a small hiccup where our steak dishes were cold but they quickly fixed this by taking it back and making us new ones they even also comped us dessert and the steak because of this error which we appreciate dessert was great too overall a great experience and we can see why they have a michelin star,Positive
burnt-ends,burnt ends owned by chef restaurateur andre chiang is currently ranked no  in asia is  best restaurants  with australian chef dave pynt on the pass burnt ends have caused quite a stir in the singapore food scene with their incredible barbeque during my trip to singapore i did not have the intention of visiting this restaurant and therefore did not make any reservations but when i was looking at singapore is burpple top  burnt ends was at the top and i just had to give it a try one way or another with only  coveted counter seats it was quite a challenge to secure a place in their restaurant so when i tried to make a reservation during the same week of course they were fully booked luckily there are walk in options for people that could not get a reservation when we arrived we were fortunate enough to snag two seats right at the end of the counter we were so thrilled to try out what they have to offer the way burnt ends operate differs from other restaurants approximately half of the counter seats oversee an open kitchen that is dominated by a four tonne dual cavity oven fired by fragrant apple and almond wood you can also feel the hustling vibe of all the chefs and watch them as they skillfully prepare your food i wished we were seating there instead it would have been a totally different dining experience we were very satisfied with the food as well as their service too bad there was only so much we could eat and limited funds there was so much more that we wanted to try on their menu their squid venison king crab seabass it all sounds really good they have clearly mastered their barbecuing technique and their dishes are very affordable until this day i am still dreaming about their perfect rare onglet steak i look forward to return to burnt ends again,Negative
burnt-ends,we made reservations at burnt ends over a month before arriving in singapore because we heard that reservations could be difficult and this restaurant came highly recommended by a friend we arrived about  minutes early and were immediately seated at the bar in front of where dishes are prepared table  i believe upon being seated we were provided with the menus and offered drinks it should be noted that there is only one traditional table which requires a minimum purchase the rest of the tables are actually a bar which gives you a great view of the kitchen there is an additional bar along the wall and one outside when we were first seated there was only one other couple at the restaurant and i noted the kitchen seemed rather calm as they began to work on orders after about  minutes the restaurant began to fill up and the kitchen came to life i noted the staff was diligently working but remained pleasant the wait staff was very attentive and provided excellent recommendations should we have the opportunity to return we will opt for the chef is selection each item was amazing and this ranks as one of my top dinning experiences the chef was over the top amazing our interactions with him were beyond pleasant we found him to be very attentive and he regularly checked in on us i noticed he would regularly check in on other guests and engage in conversations all while running the kitchen having been to other similar restaurants and reading a few reviews we were not sure what to expect the friendly nature of the chef and the entire staff along with the quality and taste of the food made our lunch an experience as opposed to just lunch lunch felt like a private experience and we forgot that this was a packed restaurant,Positive
burnt-ends,fabulous dinner on recent trip to asia chef david was preparing right in front of me artistry and precision behind the counter wait staff was terrific as well highly recommended in a revitalized chinatown,Positive
burnt-ends,burnt ends is really a top notch experience from a food perspective i never had a bad dish here on any of my visits and they are combining that with an interesting beer and wine selection as well as nicely crafted cocktails and to add to that the prices are while not cheap very reasonable so with this in mind and the fact that they are highly acclaimed as well it should actually be five stars and they could so easily be given that from me the failing is however the service part of the service is fine and that would be the chefs behind the counter they make the food and manage to be friendly and do a bit of talking to customers as well the waiters and waitresses have however on every occasion been bad first visit i asked the girl serving us how many dishes she would recommend for the two of us response was how should i know howmuch you want to eat great attitude she was then mostly spending the evening doing very kittle and having another girl run around like crazy long waits to order difficulty to pay have however been constant issues here but the food is so good that i keep coming back,Positive
burnt-ends,delicious i had heard about it from a foodie friend and called ahead to see if we could get a spot that friday night which also turned out to be their opening night eep manager says come early resto opens at  and they might be busy from  so we made plans to get there early it is   and we are pacing our walk to the resto we did not want to get there too early lest we appear too eager i lie i really could not be bothered about appearing eager after all i was showing up on opening night  minutes after they open their doors for service and we were not even the first ones there oh well silly accolade aside we got down to the menu and watched the crew work in front of us yes it is one of those counter seating placers where you get to see everything happen in front of you and it forces the crew to be ultra clean and ultra deliberate about every step yum points to the warmed oysters abd baby eggplant the latter blackened to tasty perfection everyone needs a little char in their lives and with a touch of sambal on the side with hae bi we also shared the roast suckling pig which was crazy delicious crispy crackly skin with super juicy flesh and chef dave shared that since they did not want to take away from the pig is natural flavour he would let us salt the dish ourselves smart man dessert was an ice cream sandwich really chocolate ice cream between two brownies and the smoked ice cream with wild hibiscus which was a very interesting end to the night go ahead imagine smoke in ice cream in your mouth the come here and get all those pre conceptions blown away,Positive
burnt-ends,tried this place out after all the rave reviews and hearing so much about it deeply disappointed firstly no reservations so you have to go and get in by pm to try to get on the waiting list then you have to scoot off somewhere to have a drink or kill time we had to wait for   hours to be seated at the side tables facing the wall so you cannot see any of the kitchen action and they were the most uncomfortable stools and tables unbelievable how they maximise space and charge the prices they charge and have such seats i get it that singapore space does not come cheap but still food was unimpressive we had the smoked quail eggs cauliflower dukkah which was the most impressive dish we had that night onglet steak with marrow the brioche with bone marrow the steak did not impress at all and we both felt at the end of the meal that it was not worth it at all will certainly not go back for another meal the staff there also were not helpful and had an attitude,Negative
burnt-ends,love love love this place its kind of small all food are being burnt trust t name of t restaurant totally burnt t food to perfection e are healthy and delicious bring your own fine wine their wine list is abit short but t palette experience is worth it,Positive
burnt-ends,this is our second time to come to burnt ends and it is now on our list to come every time we are in singapore not only is the food excellent but you get the full kitchen experience by watching them prepare all the dishes it gives you a real good appreciation for what it takes to run a top notch restaurant,Positive
burnt-ends,the food is five stars the experience the same flexibility and fitness for a group of friends  stars i did an extended three course lunch and the food was realy good pulled pork starter was excelent but a bit big i might have only that one next time the one problem i have is that they do not take reservations and that there are few tables they have a long counter where you can sit and see the action in the kitchen that is great and works fine if you are only yourself or with one friend wanna eat with with a group of friends then it is a problem shame since the food is fantastic,Positive
burnt-ends,definitely recommend the chefs tasting option they served us highlights form across the menu including some items that were not even on the main menu the roasted quail was incredible leeks with black truffle incredible smoked quail egg with caviar incredible duh king crab beef marmalade roasted corn my mouth is watering drink service was awesome as well great cocktails and aperitifs the wine list was really carefully curated from australia unique small producers shined on the list we did sort of a tasting across the menu since we do not really know much about australian wines and the drinking was about as good as the eating the service in general also stands out many staff ensuring the water was full checking to ensure we were enjoying clearing our plates new silver etc i broke a wine glass on accident right when we sat down and they were right there to sweep it up and re set the table with new water glasses silver etc to avoid any glass shards getting in the food sorry about the glass   would do it over again without hesitation,Positive
burnt-ends,food was good but the service or lack of ruined the experience we reserved the chefs table for pm on a wed night we showed up at   and were told the table was not ready the hostess then asked us to stand outside and order cocktails while waiting once we stepped outside no one came to take our drink orders the whole time we were waiting for our table to be ready we had to ask the waiters to clear our plates several times throughout dinner and the servers forgot to explain most of the dishes,Negative
burnt-ends,tried this place in may  on the day we intended to go we tried  times to call for a reservation but no one ever answered the phone there is no functioning online reservation either so we had to play by chance by showing up without a reservation this alone knocks down the rating even if they are full up for the evening then at least answer the calls to inform patrons once we arrived about an hour after dinner shift started the place was bumping with people and music had a nice trendy vibe and decor and was exactly the type of atmosphere we had expected from the reviews there were a couple small tables outside both occupied and what seemed like no vacancy inside we asked the hostess if they had an availability for  she was helpful and said she would look around while waiting we took in some of the ambiance and surveyed the whole restaurant the floor plan of the dining area was blended tastefully in with the kitchen very open the chefs were busily preparing the meals right in front of the customers when the hostess returned she mentioned that they only had room at a narrow steel mesh bar adjacent to the entryway the mesh bar sat about a foot off the wall and with black painted steel bar stools had about  place settings i am not a big fan of this type of seating for eating but for a bar it would be ok this actually is the other reason the rating is knocked down the mesh bar was too tight and i felt a bit uncomfortable with such little space i mean if we are gonna drop  on a meal at least design some better seating solutions,Negative
burnt-ends,the food is excellent let me just put it out there if you are surfing for a place to eat on a friday date hurry up and go down now and chope a table or make a reservation if you can eat at  pm the service we received however is what made me dock a star let is start with the happy stuff first aka my stomach we had the fresh pearl oysters to start that is right fresh and cold not warmed why would you warm these babies i have not had such fresh non grimey smooth tasting oysters in my life i do not know what the chef did while he shucked these babies but man oysters then we had the grilled courgette show up with the sanger think slices of perfectly grilled courgette with lovely waves of oven hei wafting in your mouth followed by a thick mild cheese and a puree ed vegetable is auce the pulled pork sandwich was tender sandwiched between a willowy bun made by i am guessing the stern looking baker lady who paced up and down to the ovens where her sourdoughs were baking the sandwich was well sauced and had a good dose of cabbage but i have to say the sauce was a little flat it had some spice and perhaps a mayo base but lacked the smoke or sweetness you would get in the south or at smokey is in singapore same same but different interesting take between these dishes and the next  we waited more than half an hour before realizing the servers were waiting for us to finish the burger i was dying from hunger and it was only when i asked the waiter why   of our table got their food did we realize there was some systematic course given that the menu is not labeled as such and our host was politely not eating his sanger i am going to bluntly say the waiters should have used their brains and asked why our plates were not moving mind you once we figured this out the kitchen still had to cook our food and we waited another  minutes so the last  dishes were the flank steak and the king crab the flank tends to be a cheap cut not so much fat since most cows have well exercised abs this steak was grilled perfectly medium rare with some bits of fat left on top for good measure why would someone torture me like that the king crab was the weakest part of our meal and word of advice not the best thing to eat when you are having a business lunch it was not bad per se but somehow a crab leg with fibrous meat doused with butter and a squeeze of lemon did not quite knock my socks off now the shrimp at blu however all round great food the open kitchen is also hugely entertaining especially when a table sent back their steak because someone messed up think gordon ramsay action without the f words yelled out loud i saw one sous chef taste off a common spoon after putting the finishes to a plate and place the spoon back in the common utensil basket i squirmed for a second but since it was not my dish up next got over it so yes do not expect intelligent service and you will have to push them abit if you are on work time otherwise the food coming out of the kitchen is amazeballs,Negative
burnt-ends,one of the coolest open kitchen concept restaurants hands down the the best hanger steak also known as the onglet ever it is cooked to perfection and served as a snack rather than an entre it takes about  mins from order to table but every bite is worth the wait,Positive
burnt-ends,excellent attention to detail on everything but the seasoning which is why i cannot give it a  star superb chef skills and an excellent experience would highly recommend,Positive
burnt-ends,first day in singapore saw all the great feedback for this place so i thought i would give it a go i can confidently say this this is every foodie is nirvana open kitchen a sign of confidence from the chef and everyone is sat around the comptoir overlooking the kitchen menu is revised and changed daily everything on that piece of paper looked fantastic to me everything is super fresh they will even tell you when they run out of ingredients for each dish these guys do not do bulk or industrial cooking the starters are the stars of the show there is nothing on there that you would not fancy it is just unreal how they can ace  dozens different dishes everyday i have been to many amazing places and had amazing food experiences but i can confidently say that if i was ever to live in singapore this place would be one of my weekly regulars if you love great food you will want to marry this place simply top notch,Positive
burnt-ends,love the smokiness of the food my friend did as well the queue is fairly long so be prepared to stake it out we both loved the intense beef marmalade the burnt sanger did not live up to the hype for either of us my friend also adored the fennel i personally felt the fennel flavour was good but the actual fennel did not have as a strong flavour as expected i put it down as singapore not having a great produce selection the fennel was also a touch over smoked burnt the rump steak had an amazingly reduced onion puree it was a perfectly balanced condiment to the beef the suckling pig was probably the most underwhelming the cider reduction was great but there was not a lot of it the skin was nice and crispy i loved the skin the pork itself felt a little under seasoned it was cooked very well but that was all to it it felt like a slight dissapointment after all the other food we had i dare say that burnt ends will continue to draw in the crowds,Negative
burnt-ends,finally got there awesome want to go back for more excellent service friendly and knowledgable staff food well you will have to make a booking great smoked meats and small side dishes,Positive
burnt-ends,ugh so good i practically loved every single dish we got i had been wanting to come here after having it recommended to me so many times and i finally did d so without further ado here is what we had smoked quail eggs white truffle it is good but for the price of  per eggs i would not get it again i thought they would at least give   eggs for that price but no it was really  for a spoonful of quail eggs and truffle yummy but not worth the price tag squid sweet corn and paprika sauce this is an excellent dish i was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and soft the squid was and the spicy yet sweet creamy paprika sauce even the slightly charred green onions that was probably just a garnish but i ate anyway was tasty as hell onglet onion and bone marrow sooooo sooooo good the chef came out and showed us the meat before it gets cooked but i was too busy eyeing the wine list so i did not pay too much attention they did not bother asking us how we would like it done but it came out just perfect the meat was perfectly seared on the outside and so juicy and so pink tender on the inside burnt end is sanger pulled pork burger ok could you tell i saved the best for last cause i totally did this was so good that when i first bit into it i practically trailed off whatever conversation i was having and all the excellent dishes we had before hand just seemed to pale in comparison and then we got seconds it was that good banana with caramel this was a lovely dessert though not much could be said about it because i was still in shock after the sanger i felt like it really stole the show for me anyway i digress the banana was nicely done and flavorful though i feel like at that point i could have gone without dessert thankfully it was not massive or anything so we did not struggle with it totally would come back here again there were many dishes that caught my eye that i just did not have the stomach space to try update feb  went back and had the following dishes uni with cauliflower sauce leeks hazelnut corgette toast and tomato with pancetta sanger flank onion and marrow banana caramelwill update properly when i have the chance,Positive
burnt-ends,st visit organized chef is table for  salmon skin and crackling oksmoked quail eggs nicely cooked with good flavorleeks with hazelnuts and brown butter delicious fennel orange oil and burrata goodsquid sweet and creamy will try to dothis myself at home pulled pork sandwiches with slaw excellent savory meat with creamy slaw and a fresh bun must whole red snapper decent but a bit overpriced at  op  days aged ribs ours was  k and costed  the burnt ends were amazing but this was overpriced desserts apple pineapple and banana had smoked cinnamon and caramel was just ok but not outstanding   per person for dinner and winewould i return not v likely bc there are other places for decent food in sg i would not say i was let down but i did expect more from an outlet tied to andre chiang at this price level service was average the food was good but not amazing simple ingredients were cooked well had i not ordered the ribs or sangers i would have left annoyed as i did not see much creativity such as lolla or bochinche there were not many wow moments for me,Negative
burnt-ends,surprisingly and i mean that in the best way good modern offerings at this new ish restaurant i used modern because i am lax to use fusion which often has negative connotation this place serves up what i think is a very contemporary style of food it straddles both eastern and weatern flavors perfectly well and meshes elements and techniques to a cohesive and if done right enjoyable result n b if you know a less rambling way to descibe that manner of cooking i would be well pleased to hear it competitively priced enjoyable food with some standouts a lovely restaurant and kitchen theatrics on show this is my thursday recommendation for friday or any day date night we were on a gander through keong saik friday night when we decided to pop in and try our luck the first to arrive on the tail of someone is canceled reservation so we scored a seat at the counter it is a lovely space intimate and exclusive there is also something infinitely pleasing about watching your food being prepared before you we started with the truffled quail eggs really just soft centred boiled eggs sprinkled with tiny truffle shavings and salt alright though nothing particularly alluring the sea urchin atop cauliflower mousse was quite tasty rich soft uni atop the mousse with tiny pearl type seaweed for contrasting texture the salmon roe atop crispy fish skin was more in line with what i expected from this place the best way to eat this is to smear the eggs evenly atop the surface so you get a bit of salty fishiness in each bite pretty delicious the mains here are expertly executed it has a lot to do with that large oven and grill they operate the food comes full of delicious smoky flavor perfectly cooked and tender inside but with a delicious maillard ed crust outside take the fish collar i forget the species a large white with a blackened crust cooked flaky and tender juicy inside and well seasoned and well complemented by the crunchy mixed seaweed the onglet was similarly impressive marbled beef in a dark jus topped with sliced bits of marrow that marrow was meltingly soft and heart stoppingly perhaps literally rich and you do not get to specify the doneness of the beef here but it is no matter it came pink and tender and beefy and we finished with dessert the recommendation of the warm apple was sweet dark pieces of cooked fruit below a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with nuts so comforting and delicious a bit like grandma is dessert grown up the food was of a consistently high standard which might or might not be attributed to its pedigree and it was well pleasing especially for a restaurant that serves modern cuisine that portions were fair and satisfying and prices actually reasonable well recommended and a star amongst the new establishements reminds me a little of the market grill though this place is a little more sophisticated p s they serve a suckling pig up for advance order and someone must have because i saw the pig not metaphorical at the back i think it is worth an order because they hack it up and throw it on that impressive grill before serving which must make for some deliciously charred skin and meltingly soft meat,Positive
burnt-ends,one of a highlights of a short but fantastic singapore food trip a small restaurant with counter style seating i did not make reservations and was lucky to find seating for two even though it was late during their lunch time i highly recommend reservations even though we were seat away from the kitchen half it is a nice touch to see chef pynt and his excellent staff do their thing the service was excellent and very friendly i was not sure what to expect from australian barbecue but it did not disappoint the burnt ends sanger i think is best described as a friggin delicious twist on the pulled pork sandwich the cube roll steak was also exquisite quail eggs were good also not sure i will be making many more trips back to singapore but there is a very good reason some rank this as one of the top restaurants in the region,Positive
burnt-ends,this is a beautiful restaurant with bold interesting flavors it is a good thing it is so hard to get a reservation otherwise i would spend way too much money at this place,Negative
burnt-ends,delicious meal but you gotta order carefully most of the dishes are very small and it is quite hard to determine which plates will make a full meal be sure to discuss with your waiter the menu changes seasonally but there are a few staples including the pulled pork sandwich probably the best value for money on the menu come early come often,Positive
burnt-ends,you have to make reservations for pm  pm seatings around a week in advance otherwise it is trying your luck  minutes before they open at pm i thought the food was ok but not exceptional had the tomahawk pork the beef tenderloin sanger and a few other dishes the only dish i found remarkable was the almond onion something salad the meat dishes i felt were meh and the sanger had too much wet coleslaw not to mention it was on the salty side the wine selection is good both in terms of quality and the decent mark up,Negative
burnt-ends,spoiled again with a dear friend and ber foodie flitting through singapore en route to london much anticipated burntendssg did not disappoint we could have ordered another round of the beefmarmaladeandpickles perfection love that most of the meaty dishes can be ordered by the g portion meaning even  people can shareplates and have variety intimate space good service e g we were warned of the min wait for the rumpcap,Positive
burnt-ends,aaaaammazing just ask the server what the most popular things are and order those there is one sandwich in particular as small plate to die for,Positive
burnt-ends,love this place consistently good food the aged ribs are amazing everything on the menu is good to top it all off the service is fantastic friendly helpful unpretentious,Positive
burnt-ends,very exciting atmosphere sitting at counter across from hard working and dedicated chefs who are so passionate about preparing incredibly flavorful and creative food we took a detour to singapore on our asian vacation just to eat at burnt ends and it was so worth it one of the best meal experiences i have ever had not to be missed especially the beef marmalade,Positive
burnt-ends,burnt ends makes the barbecue an exquisite affair you would not expect barbecued fare to be this polished but burnt ends mastery of the grill is inimitable prices are a little steep considering the tapas portions of most dishes but well worth it service was extraneously amiable and chipper in attitude as burnt ends does not charge for service and because the menu was impossibly succinct scant almost the staff is fair grasp of the menu helped inform our choices we had  smoked quail egg  each topped with caviar the minuscule mouthful costs a pretty penny but wow was this glorious i finally get why caviar is prized as a delicacy these inky black pearls lent a plush briny counterpoint to the nuanced smokiness of the perfectly soft quail is egg an absolute cannot miss  tomato toast lardo  looked rustic but was exquisite the blobs of tomatoes lightly torched on the grill were bursting with an incredible sweetness  beef and mustard  my favourite version of beef tartare ever it was clear and refreshing the bite of the mustard restrained the rounded body of the beef  burnt ends sanger  with pulled pork shoulder coleslaw chipotle aioli and melty cheese sandwiched between a pillowy sesame seeded brioche bun to die for best pulled pork burger i have ever had in my life in fact best burger i have had in a long time i am still dreaming about it  w a marron  accented with kombu and gilded with tobiko beurre blanc and chives sumptuous and succulent  onglet   for gm at  gm topped with burnt onion and slathered in the most divine marrow jus decadent and heart palpitatingly sinful but so wonderfully superb,Positive
burnt-ends,the good everything the bad lack of seats ventilation and seats the ugly i really racked my brain to find things they could have improved on maybe they could have given me a free sample maybe the drink list could be longer maybe the almost perfect playlist could have included better songs maybe it could be a little cheaper nope it is not perfect but it is striving to be i arrived prime time on the weekend and therefore got stuck facing a wall despite the grated table top and needs to be painted soon bare wall i still had an incredible experience half the dishes i ordered were familiar the other half completely new to me everything was delicious i also noticed that the menu had the date on it which leads me to believe fresh ingredients are being used and the plates change often i think a total of  different people served me throughout the night one of which being the head chef that sort of team atmosphere was transparent every time i got to swivel around to steal glances at the chefs at work you could write a book on the kitchen communication mostly combinations of body language and singular words being muttered at an extremely low decibel my only regret was not leaving enough room for dessert which i hear is on par with the rest of the menu luckily that is a wrong i can right in the near future,Negative
burnt-ends,love this place but the recommended  small plates and main meal was waaay too much for  girls we mentioned we were not that hungry food here is great favorite is jacob is ladder and duck hearts crackling and mustard was good too lettuce is not worth your while skip that,Positive
burnt-ends,appetizers are the stars at this place the sanger is worth having one to yourself it is messy drippy tangy but oh so delicious,Positive
burnt-ends,what a joke this place arrived at  pm we registered on the waiting list for  pax we were told they call us back in  to  minutes so requested for a bar where to go for a drink the girl was not able to tell us where to go then guess they called at at  pm obviously we had already our dinner in a very nice place close by the joke by the way we went to taratata bistrot perfect dinner,Positive
burnt-ends,i am definitely a fan highly recommended try it now before it goes mainstream this is what good food os about reasonably priced and superb quality of food its a delight to see the chefs in action right on front of you,Positive
burnt-ends,damn the grilled seafood was spectacular and even vegetables like leeks turned into mouthwatering yet simple spectacles in their hands try the melt in your mouth quail egg with caviar  and the intercostital cut  with the brown butter grilled leeks have not had a single bad thing here the waiter was a bit pushy though asking us to order more and ahead of time though we wanted to take it slowly be forewarned the dishes are small portions hence pricier than average and you are often sitting at the bar so conversation is not the easiest in groups after dinner we headed across the street for another drink and snack,Positive
burnt-ends,wow what an impressive restaurant and such a fun and interesting dining experience walking in i felt like i was walking straight into a well organized barbeque party as opposed to a regular restaurant this takes the open kitchen concept to a totally different level the oven and open grills are directly in the line of sight really the focal piece of the diners it really takes you right into the heat of the action pun intended we ordered the following smoked quail eggs this was a wonderful starter and had a deep smokey flavour the eggs had an almost translucent jelly like exterior and a runny yolk loved the unexpected smokiness of the eggs a nice introduction to the running smoke shack theme of the restaurant squid sweet corn and mild paprika the squid was sweet and succulent loved the flavours and the crunchiness of the corn against the soft flesh of the squid enjoyed the plating with the wild pop of colours fennel burrata and orange oil very interesting to watch the blackened fennel come out of the oven it was completely burnt sous chef will slice the fennel in front of you revealing the perfectly grilled fennel inside onglet burnt onion and marrow the star of the show the piece de resistence the sear on the steak was perfect and crisp and so tender insider it was charred to smokey perfection and tasted amazing the natural flavours really came through delicious butterhead lettuce shallots and vinaigrette do not belittle this side dish and do yourself a favour and order this i enjoyed this very much as it was possibly the only dish that was not grilled or placed in the oven or was i wrong the very fresh cold and crisp lettuce provided the perfect complement to the grilled and heavier dishes i would say that it is an essential order and really helps to balance out the oil and fat of the other dishes banana and caramel this was a small banana burnt on the outside and caramel ice cream on the side a smokey and sweet ending to the meal the meal went full circle starting out with an unexpected dish of smoked quail eggs and ending off with a grilled banana i liked how the smoked theme played throughout the entire dinner and this really did justice to the restaurant is name it was also much fun watching the chef david and his crew in action and feeling like you are part of the action in the kitchen i thought it was genius that the kitchen did not require any frying everything was done on the grill and in the oven that is altogether brilliant and daring we arrived on a thursday evening at around  pm no queues then and we were seated straight away service was good too overall an enjoyable evening albeit a smokey one as we came home smelling like barbeque which was of course to be expected,Positive
burnt-ends,mostly bbq items small restaurant with mostly counter only seating where you are up close watching the cooks no reservations accepted most dishes are shared sides were mostly good enjoyed the tomatoes and lardo on toast and the pulled pork sliders some things were under seasoned crackling with mustard was flavorless and bland needed more salt and mustard sides and mains were each served one at a time venison was too rare beef and fish were good  per person had to wait for seats so each of us had   beers and several meats i cannot say i would return experience counter seating watching cooks was underwhelming and food seemed over priced be prepared to wait for a seat friendly and well trained staff,Positive
burnt-ends,first of all i have to specify that this review is based on my lunch there not dinner we started with the crackling and mustard which is pretty much pork rinds with a mustard dip i was not too impressed with it except that the mustard was pretty good plus the fact that i saw them pull out the crackings from a tupperware and it was served cold would have been much better if it was freshly fried we had the sea urchin with cauliflower which was  bucks a spoon the uni was relatively fresh and i liked how the black garlic and caulifllower puree complemented the sweetness of it but it was not overwhelming good and did not think it was worth the price tag the grilled kingfish collar was as good as grilled kingfish kama gets and i liked the green apple slaw that came with it the pulled pork slaw burger was probably the best dish of all with the juicy shaved pork and pickled slaw served with a hot brioche bun albeit a tad heavy i guess i came with great expectations and i felt that it did not deliver,Positive
merlion-park,as its name implies this park features a gigantic sculpture of a merlion singapore is mascot it is a fictional creature that is half fish hence the word mer from sea and half lion here it spouts a vigorous stream of water all day long which makes for a must do selfie or instagram shot as it is also flanked by singapore is soaring skyline yes it is touristy but it is free best of all there are multiple vantage points whether directly underneath it along the water at an observation deck that juts into the bay or along the jubilee bridge which forms part of a pedestrian loop around the bay just keep the selfie sticks and duckface hidden away please,Positive
merlion-park,entering my th year in singapore the merlion and its associated water views never cease to captivate me singapore is mascot provides one of the best ground level viewpoints of the mbs and artscience museum the lotus flower that looks more like a garlic bulb the merlion name is derived from mer meaning the sea and lion the oft regaled king of the jungle the mer body represents singapore is origins as a fishing village whilst the lion head represents singapore is original name singapura lion city there are several merlion to see in the park but the large one closest to the water is the original that attracts all the attention and supplies all of the photo opportunities tourist suggestion once you have completed this part walk towards the fullerton bay hotel and check out clifford pier this is one of the locations of mahatma ghandi is ashes there is a plaque with some information which tells more of the story go find it,Positive
merlion-park,it is one of the must visit attractions in singapore everyone come here to take a photo in front of statue again it was a must see attractions if you are in si,Positive
merlion-park,lovely fountain with a fantastic view of the city behind it and the marina in the front this place is packed with tourists but well worth a visit,Positive
merlion-park,the merlion is the symbol of singapore part myth part fantasy all roar this is another symbol that is synonymous to this country merlion park is on the bayfront it is small and it is crowded that said it is a must to visit you will be jockeying for a position to take a picture with the merlion pose capture post your friends will be jealous,Positive
merlion-park,mermaid and lion half fish half lion statue is a welcome gate to singapore river it is a sign of good luck and protection the word singa is lion which symbolizes the singapore when they first discovered the land in the early day now the merlion park is major tourist attraction it is great area to visit at day and night at nighttime they have the laser light show can be seen towards the marina bay sand hotel the statue was move from the original location to current location many tourist put their hand up like catching the water or a head wash anyway you like the park can be access through the fullerton hotel tunnel if you try to cross fullerton road there no crossing above just go to ground floor tunnel to cross from the hotel,Positive
merlion-park,merlion park is a beautiful waterfront area of singapore with the main attraction being the merlion which is the iconic symbol of singapore although it is essentially a photo stop place hounded by tourists and selfie snappers the backdrop of the city behind the merlion and the view across the river to marina bay sands are worth a stop here,Positive
merlion-park,the location of the merlion is in an excellent spot you can have the merlion statue the sands the lotus all in one photo it does get crowded through the day so it is best to go there either early morning or in the evening around   hours you also have a great view at night when the sands does its nightly light show the only drawback to watching the light show on the merlion side is that you wo not be able to hear the music well happy travels everyone,Positive
merlion-park,this is obviously a must do when visiting singapore for the first time whether or not you think it is touristy there is history here i recommend visiting at night and watching the light show from across the water at the sands it can be a little crowded here but it is a cute place,Positive
merlion-park,as a tourist yeah make it one of your sites do not go with a tour you it can easily take the metro their and or taxi better to walk on your own plenty to do and sightseeing it is close to one of the other malls if you want to take a stroll it was a pretty long walk but we walked if you want souvenirs get it from there not too pricey do not go overboard thought it gets crowded so i suggest you either go early or later mid day gets hot have to try the bread worth the eggs and coconut cream,Negative
merlion-park,really nice to walk past especially while it is dark outside if you are lucky you can also catch the show with the marina bay sands light changes really nice and worth the stroll past,Positive
merlion-park,the national symbol of singaporefun fact from wiki merlion is a statue that symbolizes the country of singapore it has the head of a lion and the body of a fish singapore is name originated from singapura which means lion city the fish on the other hand symbolizes singapore is humble beginnings as a fishing village there are several merlions in singapore but there are two located in the marina bay a major tourist attraction for this reason these two merlions are the most popular ones plus the bigger one located in sentosa expect a lot of tourists fighting for their chance to have a selfie or group pictures with the bigger merlion sprouting water from its mouth but as any other tourist or yelper for that matter you do what you got to do ready say cheese click,Negative
merlion-park,the merlion is one of the famous landmarks in singapore there will be plenty of other tourist taking selfies and photos of the merlion i was here both during the late morning and evening btw it was super hot humid during the daytime here personally visiting the merlion during the evening is slightly better since you can catch the spectra water show from a far distance and marina bay sands light show at pm the mrt is not really close by the merlion i took the bus getting here and i think it is the best option overall definitely visit the merlion while in singapore you will probably spend   minutes here,Positive
merlion-park,lots of people and great people watching we took a lot of fun photos with the fountain and then went on the  boat cruise afterwards well worth it it gave a history of singapore and unforgettable views of the bay and canals i would definitely recommend this to every visitor this place is a must,Positive
merlion-park,the merlion is the unofficial mascot of singapore singapore or singapura is named after a mythological lion the merlion is half lion half fish visit the original statue fountain at merlion park the lion head spews out water into the kallang river visitors can take pictures with the iconic merlion by day or night i love the park best at night because it is lit beautifully sometimes it can get really crowded but it is lovely to be by the riverfront and see the lights from boats and the gorgeous singapore skyline,Positive
merlion-park,the merlion park is a definite must do in singapore you cannot not go to singapore without seeing the merlion and the small park caters to tourists well there are large stairs leading down to the water that make for excellent image composition strategy there is also a little pier where you can get the best photos of he merlion obviously it is really busy here but people come and go quite quickly so you are bound to get a good shot if you are a little patient there are so many poses i have seen using the streaming water from the merlion is mouth get creative lol there are restaurants nearby that are expensive but i think bringing your own food and eating in the small park or on the stairs would be doable,Positive
merlion-park,a place where you can enjoy the view of some famous spot in singapore lots of cafe surrounding it too many tourist,Positive
merlion-park,the merlion was under construction when i went in late january i only found out when i got there can you imagine the disappointment but even so the view more than made up for it the merlion is right next to the bay and across the bay you could see the singapore flyer and marina bay sands there is an area where you can go down the steps and touch the water there is no fence or anything so be careful if you have kids behind the merlion there was a smaller one dog size so a bunch of people was just crowded around that taking pics the esplanade bridge and jubilee bridge is right there so you can easily take one of those bridges then take the helix bridge to go to marina bay sands the bridges are very short so the whole walk probably took under  minutes with pictures along the way,Negative
merlion-park,there is no shortage of things to do and see in beautiful singapore visiting merlion park is yet another place that displays its beauty our first visit was on a beautiful wednesday evening in february like most places in singapore merlion park offers no shortage of places to eat this is one of those pass through attractions unless you plan on dining there i recommend staying just long enough to take in the scenery and photo ops then walk up the road to la pau sat for some satay from pm,Positive
merlion-park,some people say this is a tourist trap and disappointing but i found it worth going you can see the lion and beautiful marina baysands in the back if it is not too busy you can take pictures without people obstructing the view there is a boat goes around and you can see the lion really well without the crowds however they do not take credit cards so remember to bring cash if you wanna do the boat ride the night show was rather disappointing so i would not really recommend wasting your time waiting for the show,Negative
merlion-park,the area loops around the bay it is really picturesque with lots to see do and eat during the holidays there is a new years bash must see,Positive
merlion-park,what a great park with amazing views from different angles you can take a lot of iconic pictures of singapore from here however it is very crowded and the other tourists do not have any idea of personal space if you walk back to the nearby mall you can avoid the crowd and can take awesome pictures from the mall side n,Positive
merlion-park,merlion park is a singapore landmark and major tourist attraction it is a mythical creature with a lion is head and the body of a fish that is widely used as a mascot and national personification of singapore it is located in the park at waterside surrounded with many restaurants and cafes it can get very crowded its better to visit early in the morning such a iconic spot in singapore i did not spend much time here just spent a little time to stroll the waterside and take pictures entrance is free have nice public restroom areas too recommended,Positive
merlion-park,the merlion park is a definite must do attraction in singapore which is right across the famous marina bay sands a gorgeous mermaid lion statue that shoots out water nothing crazy in regards to amazement but the view and pictures you can take are truly stunning they are are stairs that lead down towards the water that make for a better picture again lots of people are doing the same thing especially on a great weather day this location is easily a must and you can also access the river boats from there as well obviously i am going to state it again it is really busy here people come and go quite quickly but try to remain calm taking a picture without other people in it might be a bit of an issue but it has such a gorgeous view that its kind of worth it enjoy the location more rather than worrying about the picture and this place will definitely hit the spot,Positive
merlion-park,another must see when visiting singapore most iconic landmark in the country breathtaking views of marina bay did not make it here last time and so glad we did this time,Positive
merlion-park,a nice stroll from the asian civilisations museum to here but there is no shade so it got so hot however the merlion is one statue that must be seen when traveling to singapore how could not you it is so iconic spend some time trying to get the perfect picture with the stream of water get some perfect views of the buildings and the marina bay sands hotel across as well,Positive
merlion-park,the merlion is a symbolic attraction in singapore and on our bucket list of travel fun the merlion had undergone some reconstruction and maintenance last year so we were glad that we were able to see it and capture photos during the night you will be able to capture the lights and even a show across the waters performed by marina bay sands the photo op is great and a lot of tourists will be taking the same photos you are and crowds do not dissipate until right before midnight during the day there are even more people and tour groups but all under the blazing sun photo op still there but definitely much harder to do with eyes open and with no one blocking your camera view there is a coffee shop and souvenir store nearby the statue and a lot of food options a few blocks away,Positive
merlion-park,as one lovely yelper put it this place is hugely anticlimactic running out of things to do i walked over to merlion park and was hugely impressed by the beautiful view of the water before actually arriving at the park if i was sending a text i probably would have walked straight through it is that tiny and it is not actually a park unfortunately i did not check yelp before heading over so did not realise the merlion statue is currently under construction really underwhelming but at least a beautiful walk along the water,Negative
merlion-park,another tourist attraction will i say it is worth going well you can decide for yourself it is my first time in singapore with my boyfriend so of course i wanted to come see what the hype was all about the main attraction which is the lion head spitting out water is why i wanted to come here as well as getting a good picture of marina bay pros the lion head spitting out water was definitely something new and i got to take some good pictures of it you can admire it for about five minutes and then you get over it as long as you have a picture also a great view across the water of marina bay cons overcrowded of course due to all the tourists coming here hot very hot due to the huge amount of body heat emitting from everyone is body lol also very hard to get a picture of you imitating yourself drinking water from the lion spit etc i will give this a   starts if i can but i will round it up you do not really need to stay long here and off you go to your next destination,Positive
merlion-park,if you are not from singapore you are missing out why this is one of the places someone should visit and take your photos most of the time this place is not crowded because locals rarely linger around the area you can get direct access to the water area around the marina bay sands there a ferry station nearby the merlion statue is an important symbol of singapore and has an interesting story to it if you are not sure where to take photos just look around for where the most cameras and smartphones linger you can get the best shot of you being a merlion in a far side next to the statue after photos you can also enjoy the great view of the area nearby and plan where you want to go next i recommend at least spending   minutes here whether you are hanging out with friends or family or coming here by yourself,Positive
merlion-park,one of the popular tourist attractions in town there are two ways to get here a by ferry or b ground transport you can read other reviews to see what might be interesting here the lion that guards the city looks great from the water a nice place to visit when in town,Positive
merlion-park,the iconic statue of singapore as a first timer you have to visit this park view is amazing esp during sunset where you can see the sunset reflection on mbs marina bay sands building across the river,Positive
merlion-park,if it is a nice day or night out make a visit to this park with plenty of open space for walking around the views at this park is pretty nice not only do you have a good view of the water with marina bay sands hotel in the background you can also see part of the city as well the park itself is clean and pretty well maintained i visited this place both during the day and at night and the views are equally pleasing if it is near the holidays like new years eve this place can get pretty packed quickly overall i recommend coming here at night if you are pressed for time since the views are prettier when the city is lit up,Positive
merlion-park,like most of singapore this area is very lovely and the view is almost futuristic yes you will have hundreds of people trying to get the camera just right so it looks like the merlion is spitting water into their mouths but come on you know you want one of those pics too the area surrounding the statue is also very nice there are restaurants and starbucks nearby if you need to hop inside to cool off for a bit,Positive
merlion-park,something you have to see when you are in singapore the iconic white merlion fountain figure highlights intriguing statue beautiful view of the sands hotel snacks close by like the famous ice cream sandwich in rainbow breadlowlights more of a take your picture and go type of thing and need to dodge the big tour groups all trying to do the same thing it is cool but think once you see it once you are good,Positive
merlion-park,this is probably one of the most famous tourist attractions so in other words be prepared to dodge getting hit by the many selfie sticks in the area also one of the most photographed places in singapore you can see photographers setting up sometimes with tripods here for this place check it out once during the daytime and once at night also at night there is a laser light show,Positive
merlion-park,lovely views by the water can see the marina bay sands hotel and the art science museum can see the light show from here also has statue of the merlion spewing water definitely come at night when everything is illuminated,Positive
merlion-park,a place must visit for if you visit singapore to take a photo with merlion the icon of singapore as an icon this small park are always busy with tons of tourist so is hard for you to have a clear shot when you wanted a picture with it come at the right time you may also watch the laser light show from the marina bay sands sunday thursday  pm  pm friday saturday  pm  pm  pm,Positive
merlion-park,yes it is super touristy and crowded but so fun to see take a quick detour here as part of a walk along the bay,Positive
merlion-park,when i asked my sister where she wanted to visit during our weekend in singapore she said she want to take a photo with the merlion why so to prove she was here for my first visit i did hop into merlion park for the view and it was late at night with no one around now on a sunday early evening i came back for a repeat visit merlion still looked the same but full of tourists taking photos after  minute i asked my sister if she is done at least now she has her photographs and i can go back to my eating,Positive
merlion-park,well this was a bit anti climactic dubbed the most famous landmark before marina bay sands the merlion is surely on every tourist is list of places to go in singapore so i went and checked it out to see what the hype was all about it is essentially a giant statue of a lion sorry guys do not know the history behind it unfortunately which is supposed to have fancy waterworks around it the time i went it did not so it was just a lighted up lion that looked nice in pictures the view from the platform by the merlion is nice however with cool views of mbs and of downtown go here if you are like me a tourist wanting to hit up all the essential spots but if you cannot get here in time i would not cry over it hawker centers are so much better,Negative
merlion-park,a few things about this place tourist attraction beautiful and peaceful if you find a good spot to picnic great restaurants and shopping nearby views of the bay boats and of course the lion is gorgeous lovely place to relaxnot much else to offer,Positive
merlion-park,what a beautiful way to spend the morning yes this is a main tourist spot but hey you gotta do what you gotta do beautiful landmark and beautiful country,Positive
merlion-park,another of my fondest memories from my singapore travels even though it was very hot and humid we truly enjoyed see this world renowned landmark in singapore i definitely recommend going to singapore and visiting the merlion,Positive
merlion-park,a singaporean icon the merlion statue of a lion is head and fish body welcomes visitors to quays of this former british colony city state open   with free admission of a fully functional fountain it resonates a beautiful backdrop for photos day or night note visitors must bring a camera and sun screen along merlion park inhabits cafes and bars amid a tourist trap but well worth the visit my august  five day visit brought me to merlion park as my first impression of this city state sweet it is surely a must see what merlion park is to singapore equates to what the statute of liberty is to new york,Positive
merlion-park,when i lived in singapore i think in the span of  years i only visited this place once fast forward  years and now every time i drop by i do the obligatory visit must be the fact i am getting old or just in the mood to take a douchey tourist photo as for the park what astounds me is how the scenery around this statue seems to always change as the years go by it is almost a vista point for every government project or commercial building blitz that seems to go on endlessly around here so here is what you will find now if you take the cab or bus to this place  tons of chinese and japanese tourists with the odd white person here or there a nice view of the city especially at night along with the big ferris wheel marina bay sands and some other lovely structures it gets as hot as a gorilla is asshole during the day and there is no coverage for the odd rainy days esp sucky during monsoon season  some restaurants and of course starbucks nearby if you happen to go to the nearby seafood joint palm beach seafood restaurant be prepared to pay an arm and a leg for a decent sized chili crab and most likely you will wish you ate at jumbo instead tho the view is rather nice outside have fun,Positive
merlion-park,for something that is the main symbol of this city state i felt underwhelmed with this landmark do not get me wrong the view is quite nice and all but i would have thought the famed merlion would have been well bigger and there would be more than two of them the view was nice as it offers a decent view of the mega casino marina bay sands and the major shopping mall with the flagship lv and arts science museum right across the water but other than that there was not much else to write home about so visit if you must but do not linger as there are others that might be more camera worthy,Negative
merlion-park,ofcourse when you visit singapore you have to visit the merlion the merlion mermaid lion is the national personification of singapore it is not as large as i imagined it would be when i visited the merlion during daytime and it looks prettier in the evening if you want to buy refreshments just make sure that you do not buy it near the merlion because the prices there are ridiculously high i mean to pay more than  singapore dollars for one popsicle is out of this world,Negative
merlion-park,so you have to come here and do the tourist thing snap your photo with the kitty and take in the sights there is not much else to do other than that it really is a sight to see and especially at night everything lit up around you and mbs across the way looks beautiful,Positive
merlion-park,iconic singapore pretty touristy but it really is a beautiful spot to be a tourist marina bay sands on one side and the singapore skyline on the other i would definitely recommend visiting at night when the lights are out definitely cannot leave singapore without a quick snap here,Positive
merlion-park,great area for socializing and seeing the singapore skyline but the park is not too much besides a giant white merlion fountain i do not think it is necessarily a sight worth going out of the way for but as you explore singapore this will just naturally be a part of your tour great views at night too especially of the new marina bay sands,Positive
merlion-park,good place to grab great photos of the marina bay as well as the cbd skyline especially at night always packed with people trying to do the same at the end of a nice promenade adjacent to the one fullerton where you can enjoy a number of restaurants and cafes if it is windy you could get splashed with mist from the fountain,Positive
merlion-park,i love this place the lion spitting out the water makes for some really funny pictures such as catching the water in your mouth and holding the water the background view is amazing with the marina bay sands ferris wheel and boats all there lots of tourists here the surrounding area is great with fancy hotels right by the water had a great time here taking pictures and walking around a few food places nearby including a starbucks which was doing a buy one get one special near the subway the icon of singapore,Positive
merlion-park,it is nice to visit the merlion statue when in singapore however go when it is not very crowded because lots of people trying to get their picture with drinking from the merlion kind of gotten on my nerves as most of them were just acting really stupid the view of the skyline and marina bay sands is very nice not a must see as there are nicer things to do here but still worth going,Negative
merlion-park,i really never have seen the point of this park i been to singapore twice and the one time i have been to the merlion after three minutes i had no idea why i was even there this seemed like the most touristy in all of singapore and i seriously do not know why it is a statue that puts spews water into the bay that is it there is no infrastructure or park or anything like that that would make this a destination also it was mobbed absolutely mobbed with people taking pictures and posing for pictures and all i wanted to do was get out of there as soon as possible you can walk around the bay and see the merlion and figure out for yourself it is worth walking all the way over there in a mob of tourists to take a picture absolutely not recommended,Negative
merlion-park,you have to come see it if you are visiting singapore the iconic merlion is obviously the main draw of this park however you wo not be disappointed with the people watching and the views of mbs and the rest of the city this is a great place to take in the view and watch all the interesting poses that people strike up in front of the statue or mbs in the background come late at night or early in the morning for the lightest crowds,Positive
merlion-park,popular tourist area to take pictures of surronding areas a few restaurants to snack or have drinks a bit hot weather to stay out too long,Positive
merlion-park,we walked through merlion park on our way to makansutra gluttons bay for dinner one night located on the water it is a nice stroll in the evening i can imagine how hot it would be during the day you get an incredible view of the marina bay sands complex as well as a couple of different angles to take your requisite photo of the merlin with water coming out of its mouth,Positive
merlion-park,tourist spot giving it a  because it is just one of those places that you have to take a photo of if you visit singapore other than that not much more to see or do there just know that before you get there this means that no matter what time of day or which day you decide to visit there is a chance tour buses filled with lots of asian tourists will be there aside from being crowded the lookout point gives a great view of the sands hotel and the entire surrounding bay standing on the lookout also gives you a great photo opp with the giant merlion singapore is known for as soon as you are over the touristy merlion area walk over to the riverwalk and look for the food cart with ice cream sandwiches basically ita a dude standing on the side of the road or river walk that will cut up ice cream and sandwich them between wafers apparently sandwiching the ice cream between rainbow slices of bread was popular among the korean visitors,Positive
merlion-park,great place to get a view of marina bay sands and walk around but so crowded that it can take forever to get a picture with the lion,Positive
merlion-park,no trip to singapore would be complete without a visit to the iconic merlion not only that the park provides a panoramic view of the water and marina bay sands along the water area are alot of resto bars and coffeeshops where you can just sit relax and enjoy the view and bask into the calming waters suprisingly given that there are alot of establishments around i did not feel that it was too noisy we were hanging out at starbucks and we were still able to go through our conversation without being distrubed and vice versa it is kind of a work out if you are walking from esplanade to the merlion park but i can assure you that it is worth in if you are looking for a different angle of the park try the starbucks branch located under the bridge best enjoyed at night,Positive
merlion-park,um yeah i paid  sg in a taxi to come here from chinatown worst part is trying to get a dang picture of the merlion spitting into my mouth after the picture was taken we walked all the way to clark quay,Negative
merlion-park,do people seriously get excited about this we honestly do not know what all the fuss is about ho hum p,Negative
merlion-park,you should not say that you have visited singapore if you have never set your feet here you can meet the famous merlion of singapore here the view is breathtakingly splendid and panoramically exquisite you will find that you are being surrounded by the skyscrapers of singapore and across the river you will see the uniquely designed marina bay sands you can even spot singapore flyers and esplanade from this park the view is perfect day and especially at night,Positive
merlion-park,there is a lion that is a mermaid it spews water into the bay it is a nice place to sit and relax with the tourists and catch a cool mist of water when the wind catches just right so ya i am a fan and hey you american types it is pronounced key as in the florida keys and not quay as in why you so quay quay,Positive
merlion-park,the merlion park would have qualified for  stars except that the large merlion fountain statue is being repaired and not operational during my trip luckily i saw this fountain on my last trip to singapore  years ago now it is covered in a large see through tarp the park is on the quay causeway and is surrounded by skyscrapers it is across from the marina bay sands hotel which has nightly laser light shows which are pretty cool the bay is pretty cool for watching the numerous ferry boats floating around i was able to listen to a live concert from across the outdoor arena area one night also i think the main attraction is the merlion the symbol of singapore which will return in all it is glory soon i hope,Positive
merlion-park,personally i really like it but the amount of tourists that always seems to be there really drags down the whole experience i recommend going at night i have been there both at night and day but i think it is prettier at night with all the lights and there are less tourists also at day it gets extremely hot and since there are not much shade you will be burning if you visit during a sunny day,Positive
merlion-park,i think this depends on who is point of view it is one of those places were all tourist take a picture of an iconic place where everyone knows that you were there does it have amazing food or anything else not really if you show someone a picture of it though they will know you were in singapore i still liked taking a picture with the merlion however,Negative
merlion-park,this is not much of a park really so do not expect this place to have huge rolling meadows flower gardens paths lined with trees etc all the merlion park is is a platform from where you can see the iconic singapore merlion fountain a bunch of shops and restaurants along the waterfront and a great view of other popular singapore landmarks like the marina bay sands hotel the singapore flyer and in general the city country is financial district skyline though the area is always milling about with selfie taking tourists there is a kind of an inner peace to be experienced just glancing at the majestic merlion and the surrounding landscape if you are visiting singapore for the first time i would recommend taking a short  minute detour from wherever you are going to come and pay your respects to the statue after all this is singapore is defining landmark and one of the coolest fountains you will ever see,Positive
merlion-park,first stop on a day of trekking around singapore we walked out along the man made bay past the floating football field really and over the high tech bridge to the new casino hotel that has what appears to be battleship on top that holds a private garden if you want to capture a comprehensive glimpse of asia is new wealth i simply cannot imagine a better place to do that great view of the skyline including the old british hotel on the waterfront that reminds you wow the history of this place is really complicated as for the lion stature meh though i am told he is very important to the singapore people sort of a symbol of rising from the chaos of imperialism and wwii seems that is worth a bit of reverence,Negative
merlion-park,the merlion famous landmark and symbol of singapore on every daytime there is allways a big crowd here looking for the best spot to take a photo of or with the lion fish in the evening when sun is going down you have the best light effects on the statue and when the night is there you can watch the all evening lasershow on marina bay sands hotel ps also a nice spot to make some photos of marina bay panorama,Positive
merlion-park,beautiful at night worth coming even if for a nightly stroll merlion park is by the waters and despite all the tourists crowding around the one mermaid statue it is a peaceful place to be a lot of people seem to just sit around the dock hanging with their friends and family across the the water is a stream of skyscrapers and marina bay sands the view is beautiful the buildings are all lit up and sometimes you can spot a bit of the fireworks show coming from the marina bay sands water show the iphone panorama camera does the view no justice at all definitely recommend coming here,Positive
merlion-park,one of the most famous landmarks in singapore head about it seen it in pictures now i finally seen it in person once again merlion statue so amazing might be one of the best landmarks in singapore this area is extremely cowered lot of tourist taking up the most amazing sights yes i am one of those tourist took about  shots of this amazing sculpture water coming out of this lion mouth the water presser is pretty high you can feel it from a distance it is just amazing to walk around in such a beautifully area even when it is extremely crowed lots of things to do such as dining shopping sightseeing lots of benches for you to sit down and relax during the crazy humidity yes i will come back yes this is a area you must check out when ever at singapore you wo not be disappointed enjoy guys d,Positive
merlion-park,when i ask my overseas friends about their impression of singapore before making a trip over here they often answer me with one word merlion that is so sad but true undoubtedly merlion is the most popular icon of our nation considering abundance of merlion related souvenirs as well the merlion park is definitely a to go place for lots of tourists as well for local school learning trips however even if you do not belong to any of these categories mentioned it is refreshing to drop by this park once in a while as you can view a pretty night landscape from there if you get there at the right time you can watch marina bay sands illuminate and shoot laser lights into the sky right opposite the merlion park perfect hangout to relax and just relax a little,Positive
merlion-park,seeing the merlion statue towering over marina bay with its colorful lighting and gushing saliva was the highlight of my trip to asia no where else could you see such a beautiful merlion than in singapore here for all to view and it is just minutes from raffles place mrt station with the amazing marina bay sands hotel in the distance someday i hope to bring my kids here so they can enjoy it as much as i did,Positive
merlion-park,sure it is packed with tourists cramming to take pictures but it is a pretty cool and unique symbol of the city the area around and pier also offer great views of the harbor and skyline not the easiest place to get to as you have to go over the bridge or under it but very cool once you get there snap some selfies with the merlion,Positive
merlion-park,this is a must see if you are in singapore come up into the light from your food and shopping coma and take some beautiful pictures,Positive
merlion-park,it is a nice man made statue overlooking a city lake in a business district area cute idea but not too impressive,Positive
merlion-park,a big sort of strange but also cool statue great view from here of the undeniably cool marina bay sands,Positive
merlion-park,currently there are five merlion statues in singapore the original statue at merlion parkthe m cub statue standing behind the original statuethe m gigantic replica at sentosa island where you it serves as a museum and you can ride to the top with viewing gallery in the mouth and the head the m glazed polymarble statue at tourism court near grange road the m polymarble statue placed on mount faber is faber pointmerlion is the symbol of singapore which can be traced back to the legend of lionfish of temasek,Negative
merlion-park,the original merlion is in the city a few years back it was repositioned to give way to a new bridge built for a highway there is a second merlion which is probably ten times the size on sentosa the sentosa attraction allows you to go up to go up to the top at a charge the city merlion which is free to see is just a stand and watch attraction with water jetting from its mouth currently with all the recent development happening on sentosa it is best to wait until universal studios and the new casinos are built so that you can benefit from the view,Positive
merlion-park,the merlion is out on sentosa island the island itself is a nice way to spend a few hours but the merlion is overpriced and not worth it somehow it has become the symbol of singapore though,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,ah tai split off from tian tian  stalls down the star here is also the chicken rice plate similar to tian tian it is   for a small theirs comes with chicken broth on the side it is traditional chicken fat rice with breast meat with bone and skin and cucumbers their chicken was more tender and more flavorful and the rice was richer i think the portion was bigger too i definitely preferred ah tai over tian tian also extra points for having plastic utensils during the coronavirus outbreak the other place still had regular utensils yes more environmentally friendly but i would like to limit disease transmission pro tip grab a cold beer from the stall next door to go with your food,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,if you are at maxwell food centre and having a hard time deciding between all the hainanese chicken rice stalls let me do the honors of narrowing it down for you you should be standing between ah tai is and tian tian is both stalls are literally two spaces apart from each other ah tai used to work for tian tian as a cook for  years until he was let go by management and started his own stall both are pretty good but ah tai gives you more rice and a cup of soup plus there are no lines at all i would say give tian tian a try but when you are craving chicken rice and cannot be bothered to stand in a line go to ah tai is you will not be disappointed,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,i liked ah tai is more than the famous tian tian chicken rice my friend waited  minutes to get his food i waited  seconds we both tasted it side by side to see which one we liked more and we both agreed it was ah tai is this place is slightly cheaper and a lot tastier we felt like tian tian was good but lacked the flavor that ah tai is had ah tai even has an extra soup which was also a fantastic compliment to the meal i would come back here,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,based on some youtube videos and the yelp rating we decided to give it a try this place is kinda hard to find with google navigation ah tai can be found right in the center of hawker center this place was opened by someone who used to work at the famous tian tian hainan chickenflavor   the chicken is very standard what is special is the rice which was very flavorful wait and line  the wait is pretty decent we waited  minutes at pm on saturday the wait at tian tian was  minutes price    for a set chicken rice soup and veggie is unbeatable and you get the best value of the price for sure comparison to tian tian tian tian is rice tastes even better and is more flavorful as they have adjusted the recipe multiple times since opening however the price is slightly more expensive with  if you want the veggies and chicken the portions are slightly less there and you wait faaar longer overall tian tian is not worth the wait and is recommend ah tai if you crave or want to experience hainan chicken,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,best hainan chicken rice i have tried so far tian tian is more popular but the rice is not as good as ah tai both are good but ah tai wins easily the sauce is also better rice is flavorful and had a great texture,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,with the unfortunate close proximity to the famous tian tian chicken rice this place never gets the respect i believe the chicken itself at both places are comparable to each other amazing however i would give the edge to ah tai for the following reason no ridiculous line waited only  minutes during the busy lunch rush side dishes received a free chicken soup and the optional veggie price to food ratio about  more overall if you have one meal at the maxwell food court tian tian is the popular notable one to go to however ah tai is the good locals spot to hit up,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,best hainan chicken i have ever had in my life if you are from los angeles you are probably familiar with savoy is hainan chicken which locals always rave about i honestly have never liked that place but if you like savoy you are definitely going to love ah tai the funny thing is ah tai is on the  michelin bib gourmand but the guide has it listed as ah gong which means the same thing as ah tai weird that michelin would make that error but i spent hours trying to find ah gong in singapore to no avail only to accidentally realize that it is three stalls away from tian tian hainan chicken for some reason tian tian is more popular and has a way longer line but i can tell you it is all hype i tried both and i would rather eat savoy than the atrocity tian tian is serving ah tai was so good we got a second plate and devoured it in minutes the chicken the rice everything was perfectly cooked and flavored you are missing out if you come to singapore and do not give this place a shot,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,back for our yearly trip and since we were close to maxwell food court i decided to head in to grab some hainan chicken and rice once we entered i quickly saw a long ass line that had formed for tian tian since it was a hot and muggy day typical sing weather i quickly remembered a good friend mentioning that ah tai was as good if not better than tian tian glanced over and saw that there were only  people in line i made a b line over pricing wise both are similarly priced iirc but ah tai did not have a long ass queue within  minutes i was inside an air conditioned taxi and headed back to the hotel room to eat at first glance both places offer a cheap and tasty lunch dinner the main difference between the two was how fragrant the rice is at ah tai i do not remember tian tian being as fragrant and actually thought the rice texture at tian tian was slightly off the last time i ate there the chicken at both places were good tender and moist but ah tai does throw in some veggies which is a nice addition to the regular dish will have to do a head to head comparison next year but for now ah tai reigns king in my book for chicken and rice,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,it is awesome seems like many of these other reviews tell the story and accurately too shorter lines better food not by much though hainanese chicken rice is delicious pretty much anywhere we actually bought a do it yourself package from a grocery store in singapore and made it ourselves once we got home even that was yummy nevertheless ah tai is arguably the best of the best you wo not go wrong,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,tl dr perfect for an expat ready to dive into the famed chicken rice dish super affordable and hits the spot definitely at least on par with its more famous neighbor tian tian this was all  sgd   usd i came to ah tai on my first night in singapore a friday night eager to dive into the hawker culture in all honesty i was planning on going to tian tian but they had closed  minutes before i arrived which was around  pm oh well i was not disappointed in the slightest and absolutely loved my food the chicken was packed with flavor and it was clear that the chef s at ah tai were professionals from the first bite as others have mentioned the rice had a great fragrance aroma to it which made the entire dish even more flavorful the broth was flavorful yet not too salty which is a pet peeve of mine in these sorts of dishes while i also personally enjoyed the chili sauce it can definitely be too spicy for some patrons so be aware of that overall a wonderful place to be and i will definitely return in the future,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,that is some good chicken tian tian was closed when i visited but i read that ah tai hainanese chicken rice was up there it did not disappoint the chicken was flavorful and moist the best part was the aroma of the rice that they serve with the chicken they have probably served millions of hainanese chicken rice they have reached perfection,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,unfortunately tian tian chicken rice stall was still closed when i visited maxwell food centre the second time that i was there i read online that ah tai was still a good option for chicken and rice i got here by pm before the dinner rush and the line was not super long yet the line was long by the time i finished eating but the lines seemed to move quickly from my observation the chicken and rice was good and cheap i e   sgd for medium size the chicken was moist and delicious not bad overall,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,a friend of mine visited singapore before me and told me that if i did anything on my trip it had to be visiting at least one hawker centre we were recommended the maxwell centre and headed this way to see what we could grub on before our buffet dinner we are little fatties we know like many before us we were hoping to check out tian tian do not judge us for being basic anthony bourdain was a gd international treasure unfortunately for us it was closed on the monday we visited luckily we spotted ah tai just a few stalls down our hainanese chicken cravings needed to be met so we handed over a cook  sgd and were presented with a lovely plate of rice with a good serving of chicken and bok choy a side of broth and a few dipping sauces the broth was nice and light flavorful but not salty it was just a bit too toasty in the centre for me to really enjoy hot broth the bok choy was great and paired really nicely with the flavors of the tender chicken and aromatic and soft rice and of course the dipping sauces were an excellent addition to the meal but i am just a sucker for dipping sauces my sister and i shared this plate and it was just enough for a nice snack for the both of us it was so tasty we considered getting another but figured we should try some other things while we were there for  though ah tai is probably the tastiest most slammin deal you will find in all of singapore,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,i do not know chicken rice but i feel like i got a full education of it here rice cooked in chicken stock with some chicken and veggies on the side there was also a bowl of soup which i wish i could get more of the chicken and rice were delicious and the sambal was excellent another sub  meal that i wish i ordered more of,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,been meaning to write this review for a while revisited ah tai in my recent singapore trip i can confirm that ah tai still has it going on do not be enthralled by the long line at tian tian mostly because of the bourdain effect also rip  the chicken rice at ah tai is better and minus a wait chicken is so tender and the rice is just right they also have a combo set you can order for   sgd with some veggies and soup either way you cannot go wrong,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,only idiots aka tourist or someone who just came back from a very long time travel will go to tian tian the chef behind tian tian success ah tai not only had emulated the juicy yet dry aromatic yet not overwhelming bloodless yet not over poached firm yet tender uniformed fresh yet not chicken smelly ah tai has bring this hainanese chicken rice a few notch higher do not trust any locals who tell you their fav chicken rice stall near here or there is better cos they know nothing ah tai is poached chicken is well massage before steaming only special bred chicken from a secret farm is used no other chicken rice stall in singapore use this expensive stock,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,chicken rice singapore is national dish you have not been if you have not tried it dare i reject the opinions of the travel channel gurus and side with the locals look this place is better outstanding chicken tender and juicy boiled in an incredible broth of chicken stock its collagen lemongrass and other herbs served with a side of rice cooked in the same stock and a bowl of the magical elixir itself add a sweet molasses sauce and homemade zesty herbaceous fresh siracha and all is right in singapore incredible complexity and just plain delish a bargain at   sgd per set half and whole chicken on offer lines get long  min plus do not worry it wo not be long before what is arguably the best chicken rice per locals is entering your drooling mouth maxwells hawker center two stalls to the left of the tourist spot note be willing to share your table with strangers outstanding,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,the owner of this stall used to work st the famous tian tian a few counters away today the queue at tian tian lasts anywhere between  minutes at opening at am or mid afternoon and  minutes meal times its prices are the highest among all the hainanese chicken rice stalls at maxwell although that is still most reasonable they only give out the chilli and dark soy sauces upon request although that is very much part of the dish there is never a queue at ah tai so is it worth it if you are not a foodie the answer is hell no on the other hand if you can tell subtle differences in the texture of the chicken the fragrance of the rice or the degree of kick in the chilli sauce or if you just line up servings from the various chicken rice stalls at maxwell tian tian ah tai heng heng you would have to say tian tian is the best lah unfortunately ah tai would come third although on its own it is not bad,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,came by for their hainan chicken the other day and it was a tasty experience located  stalls down from tian tian this stall had no line word on the street is that the chef used to work at tian tian the drumstick chicken rice was quite tasty chicken was very smooth and had a nice gravy like sauce over it the rice was fragrant soft and flavorful my entree also came with a small soup which was a great way to finish off a light lunch maxwell center is not air conditioned but they do have fans humidity and temperature might be a issue for foreigners maybe get a cold drink before ordering the meal   sgd for a drumstick rice with soup,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,food    service    value    decor    overall    i have done t t before and anyone who knows me knows i do not do lines unless it is a le ah tai did the trick basically just as good you know i am right but basically no line do not be a lemming save yourself the fifteen minutes and get this,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,first try at hainanese chicken went on a thursday afternoon around   pm tried to go to the famous tian tian chicken spot but they ran out of chicken maybe a blessing in disguise saw that quite the line was forming at this place so decided to give it a try so glad i did ordered the chicken set which came with soup chicken bok choy rice and  sauces all that came out to  sgd the rice was fragrant with garlic and ginger i could eat the rice alone the chicken was super tender and paired so well with the chili sauce the chili sauce packed a punch and had a nice spicy kick to it honestly did not bother to try the soy sauce looking sauce since i liked the chili sauce so much liked this place so much think i am going to try to for another visit to this place before i leave singapore in the next few days,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,ah tai definitely gives tian tian a run for its money the word just has not gotten out yet was at maxwell a couple of times and each time there was a long queue for tian tian whereas you were able to order and get your food in no time at ah tai i have tried both and i can say that the chicken was just as moist and tender here what is more you get a bowl of chicken broth with your meal which was divine even if it was unbearably hot and humid out but without a wait you will be in and out in no time,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,this is a slight nd place to tian tians a former chef at tian tian opened this location just a few stalls away from his former boss the food is great i would compare both just to see which one you like better the rice is fragrant and you can taste the granules between each grain the chicken is soft topped off with a light soya sauce and the dipping sauce is great there are no complaints but the slight magical edge goes to tian tian,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,normal chicken rice in my opinion it is overrated i do not understand why so many people are queuing for this the rice is ok the chicken is not bad but i feel that the service can be better especially during the weekends when they are busy,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,chicken rice set that is all you need to know lol located in the maxwell food court in the middle aisle it is a few shops next to the famed tian tian shop reviewed by anthony bourdain as the best hainanese chicken rice i wish i was able to compare but we came on a monday and the shop was closed much to our dismay we were only in singapore for two days with monday being the last full day so we came to ah tai since it was voted by locals as the best hainanese chicken rice plus the dish is one of ten you must eat in singapore so duh we could not leave without trying all you need to know is their chicken rice set comes complete and for only  comes with seasoned rice a plate of bok choy chicken soup and three different types of sauces to complement your chicken i especially loved the ginger but the chili sauce is just as enjoyable since it is a food court seat anywhere as you please the shop is super tiny and it is run by three dudes one guy chopping the chicken one guy plating the sides and the other handling business they were very friendly welcoming and happy at am even though most of the stalls were still setting up glad i got to try this,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,if you have read the other reviews you would know the history of this stall so i will not bore you with it this is my go to hainanese chicken rice stall do not mistake this with other types of chicken rice rice is fragrant and the texture is just right chicken is tender and flavourful not too fatty liver is good too but if you go too late they run out of it they are also willing to give you generous helpings of chilli ginger and black sauce as well as chicken soup service is good no attitude problem no long queue for one of the best hainanese chicken rice in singapore,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,sorry anthony bourdain but this hawker stall is chicken rice might be slightly better than your favorite is icon fare since your t v show the toe stalls have been battling it out for chicken rice domination it is struggle that is virtually impossible to choose between gastronomic perfect but i think fave to give a slight nod to these guys for i actually found myself not caring about the added sauces and spices yeah it is that good that the chicken and the rice are enough to pull it off without any extras truly a very succulent dish which is well worth the line wait an additional note apparently the original chief at tian chicken rice made famous by anthony bourdain is tv show is no longer there but here that explains a lot locals who are in the know line up for this chicken rice,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,upon my arrival in singapore i had chicken rice on the mind given that i arrived just after midnight my search would have to wait a few hours after a few hours of sleep i was on my way to maxwell centre to find this dish i knew enough to avoid the lunch rush hours so i made my way over there just after  pm i saw the line for tian tian first but from my research i knew to look left for ah tai is stall and there it was i look another look at tian tian bourdain is picture and quotes plastered on the side and their menu and asked myself if i should really give this a try hipsters foodies could not be wrong could they ultimately the research i had performed looking through local singapore reviews won out and i found myself drifting over to ah tai to try the food from the person that originally made tian tian is chicken what it is today there was one person in front of me so the wait was minimal i ordered the steamed chicken rice which came with rice pieces of chicken breast cucumbers and a bowl of the chicken broth this is real food with the focus solely on the quality of the ingredients and the skill it takes to prepare it to ensure that its freshness is well represented the food was served on a warped cafeteria tray with all my dishes and utensils sliding quickly to the four corners as soon as it was handed to me i kept telling myself to walk slowly and not drop my chicken rice the chicken was very juicy and very tender the rice was moist but but not wet and full of flavor the broth was clear and tasted of chicken as it should i did not find the food to be greasy oily or fatty the sauces provided enhanced the neutral chicken meat but still allowed the taste of chicken to shine through no shortcuts were taken here this is chicken done right and all for  ridiculous even though i was sitting in front of a fan this food centre can get quite warm remember to bring your own napkins i also purchased a sugar cane and lemon drink from one of the many beverage stalls nearby,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,since i tried tian tian last time when i was in town which i enjoyed this time i decided to give ah tai chicken rice a try i was not disappointed chicken was tender and juicy but the star though was definitely the fragrant rice i can just eat the rice the whole day my sister can have all the chicken so how is it compare to tian tian i guess next time i need to do a blind folded side by side comparison or this is just my excuse to just have more chicken rice,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,the good arguably the best chicken rice in singaporethe bad since it is in a hawker center the ambiance is not the best and communication in english may be a challengethe pro tip have your chicken rice with all  sauces i tried to go to tien tien the original place that anthony bourdain ate at but it was closed when i went good thing i checked out yelp for other chicken rice places nearby ah tai had great reviews and it did not disappoint had abit of trouble communicating with the shop since their english was not the best good thing there was a good samaritan who translated for us the chicken was excellent and the rice was perfect perfectly cooked very flavorful and the sauces soy ginger and chili were perfect complements to the dish as it turns out the original chef from anthony bourdain is show move down this food stall so i did not miss out after all you have not had singaporean chicken rice until you have eaten here trust me will we be coming back yes everytime we are in singapore,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,less expensive than tian tian and chef was trained there meat slicing weaker but fragrant rice so much hainan chicken rice competition at this center construction going on outside,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,another hainan chicken rice to try i waited about  minutes since there was a decent line when i got there it was worth the wait,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,i actually wanted to eat at tian tian which is just two stalls over but it was closed luckily ah tai was open and the line was long a good sign i ordered the chicken rice set for  and it was so much food it came with rice chicken veggies and a soup plus the  dipping sauces for the chicken the old man puts everything on the tray the chicken was delicious the rice was delicious the veggies were delicious and the soup was delicious get the idea the red chili dipping sauce was my favorite out of the three the yellow one ginger or garlic based maybe was also good really yummy place for hainanese chicken rice,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,located in the same maxwell food court that houses the icon and the biggest competitor tian tian hainanese chicken rice they are just a couple stalls down tian tian chicken rice i must say the chicken in silky smooth very juicy moist and tender i like rice here better than tian tian its very fluffy seasoned very well and slightly flavored with the chicken broth the soup is also very tasty the veggies is perfect cooked and still crunchy i slight edge to ah tai,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,located just a few stalls down from tian tian chicken rice is their biggest competitor created from a spat between the original owner the queue for tian tian on a sunday afternoon at pm had easily  people in line ah tai on the other hand only had maybe   people sadly though the lady in front of me ordered  boxes of chicken rice which resulted in a bottleneck watching them prepare  boxes of chicken rice let me see first hand how much work went into preparing the chicken rice as you can see the background the man with the cap was fishing out several whole chicken bones from the soup it is no wonder the soup was so tasty and yet not peppery i did not feel too thirsty after drinking half a bowl of soup i was very happy with my plate of chicken rice the rice was flavourful and the chicken was very moist and tender so much better than the yishun  chicken rice i just had a few days ago i happily gulped down the entire plate and i will definitely be back with more friends and family to devour a whole chicken next time,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,i had to try ah tai because it was literally two food stands away from tian tian plus the owner used to be a chef at tian tian it tasted good they also give you some bok choy with your chicken rice so the veggie component is much appreciated however the chicken was small and choppy it did not feel like good cuts of breast meat,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,tried both tian tian and ah tai plus several other hawkers while visiting sg personal preference is ah tai the chicken is served on top of the rice which is warm and moist chicken breast is extremely moist and tender with just the right amount of skin recommend trying both but skip the line and try ah tai,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,ah tai and tian tian chicken rice are pretty similar in many ways i heard that the founder of ah tai chicken rice had some links to tian tian chicken rice for a start maybe not related by blood but in terms of skills in preparing the chicken rice the rice is flavorful chilli spicy hut not overpowering for the chicken meat tenderness is just right not too soft not too tough do not forget the ginger sauce as well this adds a kick to the taste when you eat it price wise seems a little cheaper than tian tian but they open  days a week so that is a big plus this is especially so when you need nice food on mondays where a lot of stalls tend not to be open one thing to note is that you should specify if you want the cheaper smaller option else they will charge the larger portion by default,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,ate at this stall for the very first time last month people have been comparing tian tian to this much more humble stall and i was glad i finally gave it a shot in terms of taste profile it was very similar to tian tian is the chicken was moist and the rice was flavoursome on par with tian tian for sure,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,came to the maxwell market to visit tian tian based on popular reviews but it was closed at the time ah thai was open with a long line come to find out that the chef actually used to work for tian tian and started his own business here of course we ordered the chicken and rice set super valuable and great food definitely great fix and will be back if you are in singapore you have to give this place a try at least once in your lifetime,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,what a tasty satisfying hawker style meal we ordered half a chicken oyster sauce veggies and  servings of rice it was plenty of food to feed three and very well priced we got to the maxwell food centre for dinner around   and after waiting in line to order we sat down at a table near the ah tai stall not long after we started eating we noticed people being turned away because they had run out of chicken so probably a good idea to get in for an early meal if you want to check this place out,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,tried this shop after reading reviews about it having tried both tian tian and this stall i have to say this is slightly better my humble opinion plus point is i did not have to queue the chicken was similar to tian tian but the chilli was better,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,honestly the chicken rice here did not taste that much better or different from tian tian i gave it an extra star because the line is considerably shorter and the portion is bigger again the chicken is bland and flavorless if you ever had chicken rice in bangkok you will probably know what i mean,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,great chicken rice great prices especially for singapore which can get very expensive we had the benefit of locals to guide us and saved the time in line queue waiting to have tian tian is chicken rice this was the chef of that stall when it won the acclaim of several celebrity chefs i am sure the other is just as good but why wait in line if you do not have to you can easily purchase beer right across from ah tai i recommend tiger a local beer that is very good,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,yes i give five stars the chicken was amazingly tender and flavorful the portion size on the spot and the price ridiculous definitely the best chicken rice i have had in singapore do not be intimidated by the line these guys are crazy efficient and bang out orders with lightning speed i recommend go with someone who can grab a beer from one of the other stalls and scout out a table while you wait in line,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,after eating at tian tian i was rather impressed with their rice however the chicken there is tough and ordinary eating at ah tai blew my mind away the chicken is soft and juicy almost could swallow it immediately without choking one bit the flavor is there and the sauce enters the chicken very nicely i never looked back and always go to this stall at maxwell because the chicken and rice combination price and service combination is a overall better value far more superior need not say more,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,best chicken and rice in singapore my friend introduced me to ah tai and explained the history between them and tian tian having sampled both i would agree with other reviewer that the overall product is a superior version than tian tian the chicken is not bony or too fatty has great texture richness and very succulent also happens to be less busy and more friendly,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,i heard all about the chicken rice spat and i came to the maxwell food centre in late dec  to try ah tai is chicken rice to find out for myself what the commotion was about but i only heard crickets ah tai is stall was closed why ah tai scored a d in the hygiene department the national environment agency nea suspended his licence and fined him  the period of suspension is two weeks from    to    there was a sign pasted on the stall explaining the closure read about it here app nea gov sg advisory looks like i gotta come back another day with a stomach of steel the queue at the tian tian chicken rice stall was  mins long and wrapped around to the other side,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,best chicken rice i have ever had never thought such a simple dish could be made to perfection do not forget your soy chili and ginger sauces this ordeal will set you s  back ridiculous,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,most of us would have read in the papers about the mini chicken rice war at maxwell and for me i really could not care less but curiousity got the better of me and i decided to head down to check out the ah tai is chicken rice while the presentation is very standard expected of hawker stalls the meat is tender and the light soy dressing is refreshing for me the clincher was the rice whichi was glistening from chicken fat and full on flavours it does not help that even though there are a total of  stalls selling chicken rice the queues at ah tai are always long so be sure to get there early to avoid disappointment he closes when everything is sold out,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,my friend and i came here last night to try the chicken rice the original plan was to go to both ah tai and tian tian and get a plate of chicken rice from each place the chicken rice war between the two has been well documented so we were eager to decide who was the winner unfortunately tian tian was closed already it was only  pm so we could not do a comparison we got a chicken rice meal for sgd   which came w a bowl of soup and a side of veg the plate of chicken itself was quite small much smaller than what i remember from tian tian although it may be b c it was a meal special it was tasty and the rice was good the chicken was also quite lean yet juicy i think i still need to do an assessment by comparing them head to head,Negative
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,i have tried all the chicken rice stalls in maxwell and i have to admit the best i have had so far is ah tai hainanese chicken rice the chilli is the right amount of spicy the steamed chicken is so tender and the rice is just a joy to eat on its own the sou though lacks seasoning and could be improved but the overall experience is very satisfying,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,ah tai chicken rice is awesome the chicken is fragrant and delicate the rice can be eaten on its own the servings are very generous overall ah tai chicken rice is worth the money and i will recommend to any one who likes to eat chicken rice in singapore,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,thank you yelp for recommending this place it was amazing the chicken is tender and juicy very flavorful with the sauce,Positive
ah-tai-hainanese-chicken-rice,ex chef from tian tian brings us ah tai just a couple stalls down from the famous tian tian stall in maxwell food centre as a fan of tian tian i knew i must try ah tai and i was happy to find that overall this place was actually better the chicken very very juicy and also good portions like tian tian the rice probably one of the best i have had in singapore this rice was better than tian tian it was more fragrant and flavorful and the perfect texture the chili awesome definitely hit the spot and complimented the flavors of the chicken and the rice i have one more thing to add here the service awesome way better than tian tian the woman at tian tian is a rude lady she treats you as if she does not even want your business the service at ah tai truly makes you feel welcome he smiles he invites you over he presents himself as a happy man happy to be doing business overall the entire experience of ah tai is just better than tian tian there is no reason for me to go to tian tian anymore ah tai for the win oh it is also cheaper than tian tian,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,although this place is overhyped i was not expecting much so my experience was neither overwhelming nor underwhelming fortunately there was not a long line when i came so i got my meal almost immediately after ordering up front i ordered the cha siew chicken with rice and it kind of tasted like what i have already had before the cha siew and chicken were cooked well the chicken was tender and the soy sauce was sweeeet so it is a bit different than what i have had i think honey might be in the marinade recipe i prefer the cha siew over the chicken because the flavoring was bomb but the entire meal was very satisfying for me the reviews here are mixed but i actually enjoy and appreciate simple affordable foods and that is exactly what chef chan is belief is i am pretty glad a non expensive nor fancy fine dining restaurant like simple hawker chan received a michelin star it is worth checking out and i do not know why you would not want to spend less than usd  for a meal because honestly what can that get you especially in america nothing i personally recommend,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,on my trip to singapore i was determined to have the famous cheapest michelin star meal i was not able to locate the original stall in the hawker market until after they sold out but came to their chain storefront instead to have the faux experience the chicken itself was fantastic and extremely flavorful i could eat that stuff for days but the experience overall felt a little bit like they turned the original hawker chan into a mcdonalds it is commercial and the food though tasty came out a bit cold i am still extremely happy i was able to eat here because it was extremely tasty but the commercialization is a little bit disappointing to me,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,probably one of the cheapest michelin star meal you can find for  went around lunch time and the place was packed we waited in line for at least half an hr trying to find a table do not we ordered the soya chicken with rice roasted pork with rice and soy sauce vegetables as a cantonese i pretty much grew up eating roasted meats and chicken and i have to say the food quality was underwhelming the chicken was not really tender and actually somewhat dry same thing goes with the roasted pork there could have been more layering with the lean and fatty parts so the meat is not too dry you cannot beat the price of  but honestly there are so many hawkers in singapore that offer much cheaper and flavorful options the seating lining up situation was also very hectic given that there were a lot of people trying to find seats with trays of food in their hands in a very cramped space it was an interesting experience given the chain is fame but honestly i would not be back,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,get your fix from a michelin star cook the chicken is superb order a whole dark sauced chicken and slowly dip in the sauce to savor the taste the meat is tender and cooked just right compliment it with a plate of noodles cooked to perfection go early or the chicken runs out  starts for me,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,hawker chan was my second stop on my quest to find the best chicken rice in singapore and i was massively disappointed we ordered a soya chicken rice their specialty and while the chicken was nicely cooked the rice was bland and the sauce did nothing to help the dish just okay is the best description i can provide for how the dish tasted overall for the cheapest michelin star meal in the world i was disappointed there are so many other things i would rather eat for the same amount of money around  singapore dollars not worth the trek,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,it is everything i was promised probably one of the best meals i have ever had especially when it comes down to about  u s a meal soya sauce chicken w rice this must be the tastiest chicken i have ever had especially their skin whatever they marinated would definitely has a touch of magic only complaint is that they do it the inexpensive way which is just directly butcher the chicken so you have a lot of bones to go through   char siew hor fun incredibly flavorful hard to be disappointed with such an explosion of flavor and the meat was cooked to perfection aiyu aloe vera super super refreshing the jelly tastes like chrysanthemum with chunks of aloe i highly recommend getting this with any of their dishes i think it is the perfect palate cleanser at the end of extremely hearty flavorsalthough i only have a few days out here definitely going to make a second stop before i leave a must absolutely worth it,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the famous hawker chani was in singapore and had to stop by i heard they had a michelin star i got super lucky when i came in the line was small i waited about  minutes to order and got my food  minutes after that i ordered the soya chicken and rice the michelin star dish i got it to go because although the line was short the place was packed the food so to start it had alot of bones the chicken was cooked well not dry at all the flavor was very generic i tasted the soya sauce and it was not anything impressive i was left a little disappointed i may have set my expectations too high overall it is ok just ok there is other hawkers some tasting better in my opinion,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,simple food expect a line have you ever eaten at a michelin starred spot for  not only is singapore a dope vacation destination but it has cheap delicious food with numerous and cheap michelin starred restaurants it is cool that this restaurant is in chinatown so you can shop and continue your food journey while in singapore after waiting in the line that was literally out the door roughly  minutes i ordered the soya chicken and rice which is what gave this place its michelin star when i finally received my food about  minutes later i struggled for a few minutes finding a table this place is packed seriously good luck finding a seat as people tend to save them for their multiple person families kinda rude but smart i will say that the chicken was good but not very unique and definitely not worth the wait it was roasted chicken rice with soya sauce half a boiled egg fresh slices of cucumber and roasted peanuts super random items and plating but i suppose when they are churning out hundreds plus plates a day they could care less there are tons of other hawkers that serve the same food and you will get it in  minutes without a wait suggestions take your food to go and go sit on a bench or in the food court nearby to eat it it will save you time and energy from wrestling for seats with other foreigners or if you just want to try the dish go to any hawker stall,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,located on a busy street in chinatown it is easy to pass right by the unassuming michelin star owning liao fan hawker chan due to the notoriety we were warned that the line may be long multiple hours luckily we went at an off time and therefore did not have it wait we walked right up to the counter and ordered the famous chicken and rice compared to other dishes we had in the area i found the simplicity of the dish surprising while the flavors were very subtly the chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious i do not think i would wait hours to get the dish again especially since it is a common local dish but if you have never been and want to experience the the cheapest michelin starred meal in the word i would suggest stopping by,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i had just gone to maxwell hawker center at  am to try the hainan chicken rice at tian tian then decided to walk through chinatown to try the soya sauce chicken at hawker chan it was a short walk but i stopped several times to buy souvenirs i got to hawker chan around   am and there were about  people waiting in line it was early and the restaurant was fairly empty and the line moved quickly i had to try their famous soya sauce chicken that won them their michelin star and boy was it good the skin reminded me of the skin from a roast chicken or duck it is better than most of the soya sauce chickens i have had in san francisco the sauce is a mix between savory and sweet i feel that most of the soya sauce chickens at home were mostly salty and one dimensional the hawker chan chicken was moist and juicy portion size is on the smaller side but i was not too hungry after already eating at tian tian about an hour earlier i also ordered the green papaya with pork ribs soup fried dumplings and a chinese flower tea my entire meal came out to   sgd the chicken was only  sgd about   usd in november  it is insane there is no way i could get a chicken rice plate for under  in san francisco much less at a michelin star restaurant definitely a must try if you are in singapore,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i do not know i did not get the hype chicken rice is extremely bland i did tons of research prior to our trip to singapore and this is the dish to try but it just did nothing for me the restaurant is extremely crowded surely due to the michelin star and you have to stalk a table to sit down food is prepared quickly but generally you will need to share a table with a stranger and have someone standing over you waiting for you to finish it is not worth the hassle in my opinion it is located on the bustling food street in chinatown and there are tons of other options,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the cheapest meal at a michelin starred street food stall anytime i get to try something that is both michelin and cheap than i do it i ordered the signature dish the soya sauce chicken which cost   usd for the entire set it does not get much cheaper than that the meal was delicious i ordered a second dish to eat because it was so tasty the hor fun noodles and char siew was a great choice as well i actually preferred the noodles compared to rice after tasting both be prepared to wait for a little while because this place is very popular it can crowded but i think they did a great job of serving as many people as possible the recommendation this place definitely lives up to its reputation come here for a cheap michelin meal and discover for yourself what the hype is all about,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,located right by the chinatown mrt my bf and i came around  pm after stopping by the maxwell hawker centre it is only about a  minute walk through chinatown there was no line but a decent amount of people eating inside our order came out very quickly free wifi a c and toilets soya sauce chicken rice for a michelin star liao fan hawker chan killed it the chicken was very juicy and tender the skin tasted almost like roasted duck skin sauce on top takes the cake for flavor overall this place is worth the hype and the price,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i am the world is most impatient person the only time i am willing to wait on a long line is for good food call me a hardcore yelper whenever i travel overseas i seek out michelin starred eateries this one has been on my radar for the longest time it is just some soya chicken in a window like what you normally see in every chinatown restaurant around the world what makes these extra special i was about to find out we decided to come here for an early lunch a long line was forming quickly and i realized the limited amount of available seating the smart thing to do is stake your claim at one of the tables place your shopping bag purse umbrella or anything to hold that seat singapore is that safe no one will take take steal your stuff get on line and check out the menu before you order my yelper friend jessalyn p who came here two months before me agree that it was our favorite meal while we were in singapore the shocking part it was also the cheapest at   u s the portions are small kinda wished that we ordered more side meat dishes along with our meal get the veggies it is simple yet one of the best i have ever had i am going to say that the biggest difference i taste in this chicken is the soy sauce they use i think that is their secret they pour it onto your rice too so flavorful the chicken itself is tender as can be not one dry piece i am still dreaming about it all of our eyes widen at first bite with a look of omg it is so damn good people will be hovering over you waiting for you to finish so they can take your seating this is not a place to linger and chat be courteous eat and leave a must visit and worth waiting in line for,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the much coveted michelin star meal soya sauce chicken at liao fan hawker chan is incredibly delicious this famous chicken and rice dish in singapore is causing a stir in hindsight i wished i dined there more than once during my trip the menu is limited but everything is done exceptionally well it features chicken and pork served with your choice of either rice or noodles the soya sauce chicken is tender with a nice balance of sweet and savory served with rice to soak up the wonderfully fragrant sauce it is a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors the char siew pork was nicely charred with a delightful caramelization on the outside a great side dish while they do not focus on presentations the tastes are exemplary expect a wait for this critically acclaimed dish but it is definitely worth it,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,finally after a few years of being selected as michelin star restaurant i got to try their famous chicken rice i arrived here  minutes before their opening time but a long queue was already there when i arrived they got really busy within one hour of opening and people came with large group could not sit together my experience on the day i visited was underwhelming i kept thinking why am i paying  for this it used to be  when i tried five years ago food now is not as good as it used to be why did i stand in line so long for this food tourists from all over the world came here to experience it could be a personal preference i prefer another chicken rice from somewhere else,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,street food vendors with one michelin star rating it was an honor for the vendor to near the one star french world wide recognition you will not able to believe one michelin star restaurant only cost  sg to eat do not try to come here at  to  pm it will be long line waiting for the food i would said come here after lunch hour rush i was here at  pm only  people ahead of me i got the sweet sauce chicken noodle the noodle is hong kong thin egg noodle when it mixed with the chicken sauce it really delicious the chicken is soft and tender plenty of dark sauce surrounding it you can ask them to put some sambal next to the noodle it is great to mixed in to the noodle the good is excellent the wait is short due to not in the rush lunch hour,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i mistakenly arrived at this location shortly after  a m and was surprised to see how beautiful new and not crowded this location was it turns out that this is not the original location it is built for tourists and serving coca cola in an air conditioning environment ready to accommodate dozens of tourists i inquired with the order taker whether or not this was the original location and i found out that the original location is located just across the street and up an escalator newest store and then to the left so in conclusion buyer beware as always in this case this beautiful looking restaurant is not the original one,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i heard about this coveted michelin star meal soya sauce chicken at liao fan hawker chan for a long time and had to give it a try in case you do not know singaporean is consider this dish to be a national dish you definitely need to try it while in singapore and why not go to the best there are several locations and while this is not the original i am almost certain that this is just as good we did not know that there was more than one location and we just put the name in grab the driver informed us that this place is really great you can only imagine how confused we were to pull up to a mall vs chinatown however it was  degrees outside and thought this was just fine we wanted to beat the rush and arrived about  am there were about  people in line in front of us and the line moved really quickly the menu is pretty basic you will pick chicken or pork and then your choice of either rice or noodles i went with their famous chicken and rice the soya sauce chicken is really great with a nice balance of sweet and savory served with rice to soak up the wonderfully sauce it is a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors the one thing that surprised me was that there are bones in this chicken however that probably is what made it even tastier an order of this dish sets you back about  usd which is absolutely crazy talk i do not know how they keep it so inexpensive this is a must visit but if you want to keep it authentic head for chinatown although i am sure they taste the same,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,chicken is so soft and mushy sauce is so sweet and dimensionless best part of the meal was the rice noodles good texture and papaya soup,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,not the original which is close by but closes early p but this was an excellent alternative we got  meat combo roast pork cha siu pork belly and soy sauce chicken with rice these were all delicious and flavorful cheap at   sgd dad loved the cha siu and got an additional order he never asks for extra of anything this was the first exception i have seen we came around p and minimum wait time the big bus tour stop is less than min walk from here hop off grab some food do some shopping and hop back on,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,decided to try out hawker chan on a short trip to singapore had the soya sauce chicken rice the roast pork and the char siew aside from the char siew everything else especially the chicken rice was subpar and overrated i have had way better chicken rice in malaysia at various hawker stalls the chaw siew was the saving grace but there are much better options in malaysia as well really disappointed but at least there was not a long wait for the food,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,going to a hawker stall converted to a one star michelin restaurant puts a lot of pressure on the restaurant it is clear that there is only one thing you really order there and it is the soy sauce chicken the real question is do you get a half chicken or  chicken with rice we opted for the option that maximized this heralded bird the order seems to be streamlined quite well and they called our number within  minutes of ordering it was really good was it worthy of a michelin star i do not know about that was it worth  bucks yea it was there was no piece that was not juicy tender and soft if you are familiar with costco chicken think like  times more tender without any notion of strands of meat i honestly have no idea how it is possible to be this perfect normally you have to fight for the red meat but this chicken was just perfect everywhere no discrimination the soy sauce complemented it well and obviously went well with the chicken it did not seem fatty at all either so seems like a dish i could eat every day of the week if you start getting familiar with hawker costs you realize this place is double the price of other chicken is it twice as good probably not would i go here vs other ones with limited time no question,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,okay so now that i have actually visited it is pretty good but i do not see why it has a michellin star prices are pretty good it tastes pretty good but the white meat can be a bit dry aiyu jelly is surprisingly good,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,it is funny reading the reviews on here and seeing where everyone is from hello from los angeles of course i also have heard of this place because of the michelin guide and it being the first hawker stall receiving a coveted star i had to try it all the soya chicken the char siew the roasted pork and more i had the soya chicken plate with the rice   sgd and the  way platter which comes with the char siew roasted pork and the pork rib  sgd it was amazing you could really taste how different the soy sauce brew is in comparison to other restaurants the sauce is sweeter than most but with a very unique spice floral undertone the char siew was amazing as well because of that unique soy sauce brew the roasted pork is like any other in sg so you can totally skip this because i think they just have this just to have people order it this place is crowded on the weekends and getting a table inside is quite difficult so to avoid the chaos the best thing to do is order your food as take out and bring it with you to the nearby chinatown food street tons of outdoor seating during the lunch time and you can enjoy the meal without tons of people surrounding you as they queue or wait for you to leave and take your seat this place wins for the price and their awesome product this guy from the us will be back for sure,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,we were only mins walk from our hotel and had to make a trip here to tryout it is famous soya chicken we arrive before opening and there was a short line formed monday you place your order you get a ticket and then pick up your food when your number is called it was not too crazy busy when we went to eat was still a tad early for the lunch run i supposed the noodle was perfectly done and the star of the show the soya chicken man the meat just melts in your mouth perfectly seasoned and tender to consume i was in soya chicken heaven which is why we went back the next day tuesday am and just ordered half a chicken it is was damn delicious to not go back for seconds other than the soya chicken the roasted pork and bbq pork char siew were also delicious the choice of meat used for cooking enhances the flavour and tenderness of the finished product the two pork dishes will not disappoint as they stand their ground against the soya chicken,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,line was not too bad on a wednesday at pm which is surprising but after us multiple large groups came in you can opt in to wait in line with the cashier or order via the automated machine the machine is is easy to use from what i saw so it is a good option if there happens to be a long line service super quick mostly self service longest part of our wait was to order tables turn over extremely quickly too because the busboys keep an eye on the tables well and take empty plates immediately then wipe down post ordering your receipt comes with a number and when your order is ready it pops up on a screen go back to the pick up area next to the cashier then lady there was nice and repeated my order to make sure it was correct and then took the number portion off my receipt  ambiance loud but much cooler and nicer then it would have been across the street if it was still in the chinatown complex note do be prepared to split a table with someone there is limited space and we all want to eat our food and go eats roast chicken soya noodle   savory tender and moist probably one of the best versions i have had of this dish definitely good and well worth the price the noodles are also well worth mentioning here they are soft but still chewy delicious with just a bit of the bbq chashu sauce that comes on the side roast pork rice   i actually enjoyed this much more then the chicken as a kid i loved roast pork more then roast chicken simply out of laziness haha no bones versus bones haha so i do have good memories with this dish however hawker chan is roast pork is different in that you can really taste the spices in a good way it is extremely aromatic for something that is usually so simple note hot sauce soy sauce and chilis are available directly to the left of the pick up station this is also where you get your chopsticks and spoon overall would definitely return even with the price hikes given it is new location and fancy ordering system because it is still a destination and achieved something never done before,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,wow so simple yet so amazing soy sauce chicken is the main attraction and it did not disappoint,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,got here early as it was a block from where i was staying so i did not have to deal with the lineup ordered the chicken and rice and was not disappointed you get a pretty good meal for under  which you can do much worse in town chicken was nice and had good flavours recommend showing up early to avoid the lineup and have a head start with a late breakfast early lunch here,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,seated near the chinatown food complex hawker chan was one of my favorite meals visiting singapore service was really fast when we arrived there around pm on a friday the restaurant was nice and air conditioned which was a nice change from visiting all the hawker centers in singapore that were out in the open my wife ordered the famous soy chicken and rice while i got the meat combination platter normally my wife is not a fan of soy chicken but she said this one was exceptional the chicken was moist and the rice with sauce was a perfect accompaniment i ordered noodles to go with my combo platter of meat char siu roast pork and roast duck the char asia was by far the best piece of meat on the plate the roast pork and duck were also good but nothing stand out the sauce with the noodles was really good on not too saltyoverall a great meal for a great price really glad we got a chance to eat here,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the soy sauce chicken and rice was good but it was not that much better than what i can get back home the most notable aspects are that the chicken is really moist and the price is cheap the serving is small barely more than a chicken leg and a portion of the thigh it came with about a rice bowl worth of rice i also ordered the char siu noodles based on all the other reviews again nothing that special in either the roast pork or the noodles finally they did not have any napkins so bring something to wipe your hands it is worth checking out but do not set your expectations too high,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,definitely get the michelin star meal so worth it chicken was tender and delicious only reason is not getting a  star is because i wish the chicken had more meat a lot of bone,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the cheapest meal i have ever eaten it is worth the hype i came here after hearing it is the cheapest michelin starred meal in the world confirmed it really is we ordered the soya sauce chicken rice   sgd   usd and char siu noodles  sgd   usd the soya sauce is the star of the show the chicken is super tender the sauce is sweet and everything works well with the rice the char siu was also very tender the egg noodles were just typical egg noodles get some spicy sauce to eat with your food it is delicious the wait was not bad at all for dinner on a weekend singapore has the most amazing super cheap food despite being the most expensive city in the entire world this place is definitely worth checking out if you are in singapore you wo not be disappointed i am giving it  instead of  stars because i found a little too salty cannot complain though cheapest meal that is not greasy and gross american fast food p s bring your own napkins they do not really hand them out in singapore i learned this after a couple of days of eating at restaurants and always having to look for napkins,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,apart from the waiting time soy sauce chicken pretty good soft and succulent well balanced sauce salty and sweet wish the green chili was a little crunchier and that would have been perfect noodles are done just right so all good there will be back for sure but probably at even a better time mins a little too long a wait oh yes do not bother trying the bbq porks as there are better else where stick to what they are good at soy sauce chicken,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,kind of over rated but cannot beat it for a  meal one of those must check out places in singapore,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,if you eat lunch in singapore maybe you will have to pay   each person however you will pay only  or  each person it is enjoyable more than you pay you have to place your order on your own collect your dishes also you have to find your seat,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this review is for the actual liao fan hong kong food stall now known as hawker chan instead of the hawker chan restaurant which opened after the michelin star was earned yelp is a bit confusing in that reviewers are posting reviews for both locations on multiple businesses which all have different addresses the food stall is located on the second floor of the chinatown complex which is across the street from the air conditioned sit down restaurant the reason i chose to eat at the stall is because the prices are cheaper and the food is supposedly better also if i am going to come all the way here it is better to eat at the original right especially since hawker chain restaurant chains are now popping up all over the world the soya sauce chicken noodle is the dish that earned this place a michelin star at the stall it is s   super cheap for a michelin star meal i also ordered a char siew rice which was also   there are some other menu items that also looked delicious like the soya sauce chicken rice roasted pork rice and the chicken hor fun most dishes are s  and under let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good the chicken was very tender and juicy the noodles were cooked well i love that they poured their delicious sauces all over my plate was it amazing i am not sure there are a lot of other stalls in the area serving the same exact dish and most of them are also really delicious i am not sure what makes the chicken stand out the char siew however was really good i liked it more than the chicken overall i think my expectations were too high because of this place is popularity and its star the only reason we came here was to try the cheapest michelin star meal in the world i am not sure if i would come here again and wait in the really long line comparing this place to other one michelin star restaurants i would give it a four star good food at a very cheap price comparing this place to other hawker stalls i would give it a five star,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,so good enough space to dine in the crowd moves fast too i went around pm on a saturday and did not wait more than  mins got the soya chicken flavorful moist but not a lot of meat ehh the plate is   char siu i felt this was better flavorful tender ordered a side for  bokchoy fried garlic bits on top with oyster sauce and cooked al dente overall it is good affordable and this was enough to serve  people without being stuffed,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,tried the soy sauce chicken which earned this place a michelin star it was very good tender and silky and very flavorful the rice and noodle had the sauce too the place is very casual you will have to fight for a table,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i thought this was the original location so i tried to get here by the pm closing time but this is the other location which closes much later the line was not too bad and i got my food on time seating clears up pretty fast as people do not linger around i ordered the soya sauce chicken rice and added char siew with it i should have skipped the char siew because it had bones in it and the chicken rice was more than enough just enough fat but not too much to take away from the juicy flavor i just wish it had a little more meat in it but that is because i am used to the larger portions in general in the us this meal is pretty cheap considering food that is not ordered at a hawker center is expensive here and it is a michelin star rated restaurant on top of that if there is any place you eat in chinatown singapore try this out,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,unbelievably delicious it is all in the soya sauce that is generously given with your rice and noodles the apple tofu was outstanding definitely lives up to the hype we are only in town for a week but are planning to go back again,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,an excellent meal here authentic great chicken and rice dishes long lines here and every seat is taken quick service overall the sha chei pork is awesome as well reminds us of chinatown new york food,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,yo what is up it is ya boy back at it with the cheapest michelin star meal in the world during our travels in singapore you know your boy had to come through here i looked up many places to eat before our trip as soon as i saw a video on this place i looked forward to the moment i would feast on this delicious meal lemme break it down for ya fam you are going to wait in line during the busy and off hours the line and turnover is very quick once you place your order be sure to look for a place to sit during this time the seats fill up fast so look around to see which parties are almost done with their meal and ask them now to the main entree this soya chicken is so juicy and flavorful in every bite from the skin to the chicken meat it was a delicious experience to throw down on i recommend getting the half chicken instead of the regular size the regular size just feels to little with the amount of chicken compared to the above average amount of rice they give besides the half chicken wo not break the bank either,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,liao fan touts itself as the cheapest michelin starred meal in the world and it certainly was inexpensive the famous chicken rice was less than sgd  we were initially a bit intimidated about the potential line but it turned out to be a non issue we waited less than  minutes to order and about  more minutes for our food to come out although liao fan is clearly touristy the food quality is nonetheless fantastic the chicken may look simple but one bite into it you will realize that it is a tender delicious masterpiece the meat is silky smooth and the skin has just the right amount of seasoning it is amazing,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,words not worth it it pleases me that i did not have to wait on line since i got here after the lunch rush while i am glad i tried it this definitely was not worth the trip maybe the chicken is better at the original location it closed by the time i got to the area and maybe it was better before the michelin star i will never know,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the best char siew and noodles i have had in my life great systems for ordering and waiting for food a very clean restaurant i give it four stars because the staff are very friendly they do not care about the customers,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,hawker chan is a great cheap eat for being on the michelin list their claim to fame is their soy sauce chicken which i tried the chicken was tender juicy and flavorful that paired well with plain white rice i came on a sunday morning around  am no line and easily found seating i recommend using their electronic kiosk to order because that seems to be faster than ordering with the cashier the kiosk accepts cash and credit cards prints a receipt at the end to get your meal i also ordered the bean sprouts which i thought were too salty the portions are plentiful for  people staff seems to work quickly to clear and clean tables overall my experience was good but i was not totally blown away,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,how this place got a michelin star is beyond my comprehension i realize the michelin star was awarded to the original location in the actual hawker center however the adding of locations must have have a negative effect honestly it was easily the worst food we have had in  days in singapore the chicken was not very tasty yet it was juicy perhaps because to us it seemed undercooked we had seen videos and saw some redness in the meat but this was a little much rice was basic sauce gravy did not really add anything sadly the half egg was the best part skip this place way better food all around,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,if you want to try out where chan hao meng is michelin star soya chicken all started this is where you need to be but let me remind you this is in a hawker center open air dining in hot and humid conditions since it is in a hawker center there are several stalls that offer a variety of food and you just have to walk around patiently to find hawker chan a good indication that you have found it is the longest line in the entire hawker center you place your order find a table and enjoy your meal or take yours to go there is a charge for to go containers if you want the full experience and you are not the whiny type come here otherwise go to the air conditioned version across the street and pay extra for the slight convenience i have tried their soya chicken char siew roasted pork rice and noodles my favorite was the roasted pork it is everything that is good with chinese roasted pork de li cious the noodles tend to get cold quick so you might want to take a quick pic of your food for instagram and eat right away,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,awesome soy sauce chicken for really cheap price we ordered  meals plus a veggie plate some drinks all less than  sg what a deal highly recommend this place for excellent food in air condition seating area,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,decent soy chicken i got the breast and unfortunately it was a bit dry too dry in fact for a michelin starred restaurant expectations were high naturally so it was underwhelming and disappointing to say the least if this is michelin then so can a lot of other places maybe go in with a mindset of super cheap chicken and you would be happier,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,wow that is all i can say about this place the soy sauce chicken was amazing so tender and flavorful and the rice had some type of soy sauce something on top which made it even more delightful when you order it says pax and i was holding up the line on the kiosk so had to google what that meant and it means the number of people i do not know where that originated from but glad i know now this place deserves the michelin star award for how awesome the food tasted cannot wait to go back when in singapore,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,we were just curious to try the hong kong soya sauce chicken rice and noodles as it is a michelin star restaurant we shared a chicken rice and pork noodles with wifey it is delicious but nothing special except that the price is not as the usual michelin star restaurant price it is fast food style service no gimmicks and you will get your order in no time,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i went to eat at hawker chan last thursday nov   outlet at china town and the soya chicken was the best chicken i have tasted although the meat was cut thick the meat only needs a few chew and its like magic melting in your mouth its totally a recommended place to go to eat keep up the service and the food quality,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,after hearing that hawker chan was the first hawker stand to received the coveted michelin star it jumped to the top of the list of places to try during our trip back to singapore after talking with a few locals i was a bit reluctant to actually make the effort to check this place out all of them were in agreement that the soy sauce chicken was rubbish not sure if it was because of what they thought of the food or if it was because of the drastic price increase after receiving the michelin star we arrived about  mins before they opened and found ourselves at the front of the line it was not until  mins before the shop opened that the line started to get long it took around  mins before we were called to the counter to pick up the food grabbed some condiments and headed to a table ended up ordering half a chicken a bowl of rice rice noodles and an order of bean sprouts the chicken was super tender and even the breast meat was super tender and all pieces of chicken were flavorful what sets this soy sauce chicken apart from all of the rest is with how well seasoned the chicken is and the unique flavor of the soy sauce they use it is evident in with their dark soy sauce they offer as a condiment as it has a smokiness to it the only complaint i have was with the bean sprouts wished they cooked it longer as i personally do not like the taste of raw bean sprouts i would definitely recommend this place as the soy sauce chicken did live up to the hype did not try any of the other bbq dishes but soy sauce chicken was awesome oh and this location also boasts cold ac,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,there were so much talk about this restaurant and we often see a long line to the restaurant so we felt lucky this time we ordered the famous soy sauce chicken sincerely we are disappointed the chicken meat is too dry in compare with other singaporean famous chicken rice,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,another questionable michelin star given the price we paid approx  for  people i did not expect mind blowing food but i felt that this was not that different to other soy sauce chicken places that i have been the chicken was slightly better than average and the rice was really mediocre fortunely the wait was only like min saturday around pm if i had to wait an hour i would have given it  stars it was worth trying though just to be able to claim that you have had such a cheap michelin star meal,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,was not blown away it is my first michelin star restaurant since it is the only affordable one out there they taste good but they taste just like any other good restaurant we had the soy chicken rice and soy chicken noodle they were good but if this is michelin star i know other places that deserve the star too then service was very quick though and the price might be cheaper than other restaurants that is not michelin star we also had the seasonal vegetable which at the time was gailan it was good too but any other dumpling place is good too so nothing too special we had both the  different cold teas next to the cashier and the aloe vera agar refreshing,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,it is now called hawker chan per the sign formerly known as liao fan hong kong soya sauce chicken rice noodle you wo not find a cheaper michelin rated eating establishment anywhere in the world for the famous see yao gai fan soy sauce chicken rice it is s  with the current exchange rate that is about   usd it is pretty much free then the chicken itself is fantastic definitely higher quality than what your typical hk bbq shop would offer the chicken here is plump and succulent with gushing taste another thing i am surprised that no one talks about the char siew this breaks into my personal top  char siew experiences it is got a perfect balance between meat fat oiliness marinate and sweetness it just melts inside your mouth and the outside has a good burnt char appeal if you get the chicken rice i strongly recommend the char siew as a side they actually open at am and regardless of the day of the week there is going to be a long line the original location where you can see the owner is found in the chinatown complex food court there is another hawker chan restaurant set up outside on smith street which for some reason has the same offerings but at a premium not sure what that is all about but your best bet is to just go to the actual original hawker in the food court anyways for what you are paying and what you get this place is great man man sik oh and one more thing the owner is actually not a singaporean he is malaysian from ipoh,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,not the best chicken rice i have ever had but clearly you need to go for the experience to get a really good chicken rice plate for singapore   is incredible flavors are spot on and they take a lot of pride in the specialty craft check it out,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i had such a great expectation for this place and i was underwhelmed tried the ribs char siu and crispy pork and i have definitely had better in other places in singapore and other cities the price is right most stuff less than us  their ordering system is cool either order on a computer pad or at the counter you can pay with credit card with the former not going back anytime soon for it,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i came here twice at the end of august during my visit to singapore this review is strictly about the food i love soy sauce chicken i do not like white meat and always prefer the dark that being said this is the best soysauce chicken i have ever had in my lifetime thus far ever since i left singapore i have been craving it so much it left such a strong impression on me that i now refuse to order soysauce chicken back home because i know i will be disappointed the chicken is so so so so tender i ate the white meat yes the white meat and it was juicy and moist the one place i do not mind eating white meat chicken instead of dark that says a lot for me also the soya is sweet and savory they pour the same sauce over with your rice or noodle i do wish they gave a little more chicken though after my first visit i had to go back and get half a chicken i also got a side order of the roasted pork and the cha siu each time i have ordered these they were always very flavorful and juicy the pork was super crispy and the burnt ends of the cha siu were delicious now i am salivating and hungry and craving all this as i finish my review p s i also enjoyed the pickled chili peppers from the condiments section i would come back to singapore just for the chicken,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,as one of the only hawker stalls with a michelin star i knew i would regret not trying it out after a  hr wait on a saturday shout out to my brother who stood in line for me the entire time lol we ordered a whole chicken a roast pork rice some other pork rice and vegetables the soya chicken was delicious tender flavorful and cheap the roast pork was also delicious and only  everything else was meh as much as i liked the soya chicken i think it was only worth the experience i would not do it again and would not recommend anyone doing it just to try the michelin chicken there are definitely better places for chicken rice and probably all singapore locals will tell you the same no one in my family thought it was worth the wait lol,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,food    service    value    decor    overall    stopped by the new snazzy store for the famous soya chicken it was real cheap but frankly the portions are real tiny wish there were better options that did not artificially keep prices down the chicken was good though totally worth trying,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,anyone who is a foodie traveling to singapore will naturally want to try the cheapest michelin starred restaurant ever so of course i found myself queued in a line that wrapped outside the door this location is not the original hawker stall but rather the newer fast foodesque building though the line appeared to be intimidating we actually did not wait too long and were eating the famous soya chicken in less than  minutes i personally was not a fan the chicken was tender and had an interesting flavor but it was not anything innovative that i have not already had in a medium to good chinese restaurant yes it was affordable and the sides were great complements to the meal getting a seat to eat was very difficult due to the popularity you will have to be aggressive and share tables with strangers i am glad i tried it though i probably would skip it on my next trip back it is definitely worth your time to say you have had once i would recommend coming as early as possible to reduce your wait time,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this place is pretty good but maybe a little overrated the soya sauce chicken is good but can be a little dry this location has plenty of seats i actually liked their char sew better additionally going over noodles was pretty good too i guess you cannot beat the price for eating at a michelin starred restaurant though,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,had to make a visit here cheap and has a michelin star went on a thursday afternoon around  pm and the place was sooo packed you order pickup from the counter and all seating is self seating although there is plenty of seats it took some time to find a seat for  because it was so crowded my boyfriend and i each ordered their famous soya chicken and rice dish i ordered the roasted pork with noodles and the bf ordered the chair siu with noodles my take on each dish soya chicken and rice the chicken was tender but a little dry i ended getting a portion with a ton of bones whereas my bf said his was boneless the rice was cold and hard blegh was disappointed with this dish roast pork with noodle i enjoyed this dish more than the soya chicken dish the noodles were tasty and the pork skin had a nice crunch to it the bf said he liked the char siu dish with noodles worth a try but i did not understand the hype maybe it is just this location other reviews said the original stand is better,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the wait in line is part of the charm we got to see the owner and head chef himself being interviewed and photographed the food and overall atmosphere is fantastic,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,we tried the signature soya chicken rice chow fun veggies and aloe aiyu dessert everything was tasty although between the hawker dishes i prefer ones in the maxwell center i actually really liked the veggies followed by the aiyu dessert a bit too sweet but you cannot get aiyu outside asia so i will eat it nonetheless,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,delicious there was a little bit of red around the chicken bone and a lot of little bones to eat around but the chicken was super tender and soft the soya sauce on the rice was the perfect topping alongside the fresh cucumbers on the side if i was not from   miles away i would eat here much more often for  it is the best cheapest meal you will get,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,came here because of their one michelin star award i was expecting a small food stand but this place has been renovated and operated more like a restaurant with faint air conditioning there were a lot of tables for seating their soy sauce chicken and rice used to be  and it is now   after gaining a prestigious award i wish i got dark meat pieces because although the chicken skin had fantastic flavor savory with a perfect amount of sweetness the white meat was a bit dry i had high expectations but unfortunately this place did not hit the spot for me,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this restaurant is famous for its cheap michelin star chicken rice this chicken differs from all other stores in its tenderness and seasoning very tender and juicy flavourful and balanced taste another one of their specialties is the red sauce that they serve with the chicken rice this is my favorite part of the meal the sauce is sweet tangy not too spicy it contains a lot of flavour without coming off as too strong or too rich the rice is drizzled with a mysterious black sauce with a sweet aftertaste i normally do not eat rice but by the end of the meal i had devoured most of it definitely recommend this place the pricing is reasonable for the portion size,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,one of famous michelin starred hawkers while hawker is still in the name it is clear upon arriving that after the internationally recognized success and accolades hawker chan made his business into an established restaurant enterprise there is a very organized numbered mode of ordering a continuously looped video of hawker chan is origins on multiple screens in the space and perhaps most importantly cold ac blasting over the numerous dining tables i had the chicken and rice plate the food is very simple with straight laced chinese flavors i do not know what michelin starred food is supposed to be like but while my meal was certainly appetizing and satisfying it was nothing life changing however the combo of well marinated meat carbs veggies ice cold beer ac amidst the heat and humidity outside should not be underestimated,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,awesome food great prices a little hard to find and queuing can be tedious but it is worth it,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,amazing chicken rice but honestly it was the pork that blew our mind my recommendation would be to get one of each because after waiting in that line you have earned it pro tip grab a beer at one of the many drink stalls to sip while you wait the line moves very slowly but it is totally worth it,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,it is hard to miss with the long queue long wait yes i waited about  minutes before ordering but once you order you get your order within   minutes worth the wait debatable but more on the yes side i think it is worthwhile for anyone that has to time to try to try i mean this is super affordable for anyone who is looking to try a michelin star restaurant for no more than   usd per item the soya chicken is super fragrant and cooked perfectly moist and tender but nothing that was out of the ordinary as i have had many similar items in hong kong i did not particularly like the sambal or the red sauce that was on the side with my egg noodles meh i would just stick to the chicken and rice we also got the char siu with rice and again pretty disappointing it was too crispy on the outside very charred and too salty fatty for my liking sauce over the rice was good though soya chicken and rice is the way to go,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,wow this place is quite an upgrade from their simple hawker stall even has an automated kiosk where you can place your order by credit card nets the prices are slightly higher averaging  for a plate since you are paying for the a c and nicer seating area worth it though no line at all if you go on a weekday around  pm you get a number for your order and they ring a bell when your number is ready pretty tech savvy now if only the waitress did not incessantly press the bell every single time i still think the charsiu  is the best meat of them all it is lean while still has amazingly browned and caramelized edges i would buy a whole piece if they let me also if you are really into the meats would be worth it to try the combo meat platters charsiu roast pork for  or charsiu roast pork chicken combo i also really liked the rice here and the homemade brown sauce that was poured on top of it it had a very interesting plummy sweet savory flavor that was very complimentary to the meats,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i had heard of how a food stall had earned a michelin star so we wanted to check it out when i was in singapore i was a little confused when my googling brought us to this location that was clearly not a little stall but instead a newer location opened up after the success of the stall we were not sure if we should just eat here or go find the original stall a little research brought me the following information i cannot guarantee it is all true since i did not actually go to the stall the food tastes pretty much the same at both places the food is more expensive in this store there is a much longer wait at the original stall and no ac after weighing the cost benefits the big one being ac we decided it was not worth it to try and find the original stall so we got in line and ordered soya sauce chicken rice   a simple dish but the chicken was actually really delicious the meat was tender and full of flavor the soy sauce flavored rice was also simple but a good addition pork rib noodle   the sauce was on the sweeter side with the option of mixing in the spicy sauce i did not the pork rib was probably my favorite of the pork meats we tried  combination platter char siew and roasted pork   i was not too impressed with the meats as they were both quite dry and not that flavorful seasonal vegetable   pretty basic dish but helps to keep the meat from being too overwhelming nothing amazing but it was done well roselle tea   this tastes a lot like suan mei tang not sure of the english name it is sweet and tart similar to cranberries maybe im personally not a huge fan the food was good and i left feeling satisfied without needing to break the wallet that being said is there probably better food out there very likely so but at least you can have bragging rights about eating at a michelin star restaurant i would definitely recommend trying it at least once if you are in the chinatown area,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,expect long wait times just to eat food is really worth the michelin stars it is my first time in singapore and i just knew that i have to eat here,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,really cheap the lines moved fast was not hard to find a table at all we ordered the famous soya chicken with rice and then a crispy roast pork with noodles and shared it among  of us the sauce was really good the chicken super moist and flavorful recommend it for sure if you are in singapore,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i will start off by saying i am from the states and had to try soya chicken from the revered cheapest michelin starred restaurant in the world soya chicken from my hometown is so dry that i would never order it so my thought was how can chicken get better especially to the point that it deserves a star if you want the full on experience you must go to the original hawker stand on the nd floor of the building across the street but it usually has a longer line and opens later than the new chain restaurant opened on smith street also if you are price conscious while on vacation the stand is cheaper soya chicken dishat stand  at franchise   half a chickenat stand at franchise we tried both places and think the food is pretty comparable the franchise is more to make money from tourists for the investment firm that approached the chef i believe the chef gets  of profits or  share of the business you can get angry at the price difference but you got to give the man props now he will actually make money for about the same amount of work my group also tried several of the soya chicken stands in the area and they do not compare for me its all in the texture and flavor the chicken is tender while succulent and reminds me of roast duck but with the heavy flavor of soy sauce delicious i would definitely recommend the trying either location but this one has a c for all you tourists out there like me,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,hawker chan is supposedly the cheapest michelin star restaurant in the world for how much i paid   usd for a plate of food i guess i cannot complain about my experience here but in terms of the food itself it is really just ok not bad not great overall it was fun to try once and say i have been to a michelin star restaurant however given the long lines and crowds of tourists i would rather pay just a few dollars more next time at a different restaurant for food that is just as good,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,it was tasty i wish the outside of the chicken were crispier still the flavor was delicious it is a must visit once if you are in singapore had i a month here i would try more of these little places and pick the michelin myself anyway this is a worthy choice try the ribs too,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i am honestly wondering if i am missing something here i have been in singapore  months now and this chicken rice was not as good as many of the food stall chicken rices i have consumed first off there is a lot of little bone splinters in the chicken i understand that is part of certain chicken rice recipes but not as enjoyable for me when i am constantly picking bones out of my mouth while trying to eat more importantly than the bones though is the fact that the chicken was literally cold when i got my plate i do not know if this is part of their recipe but i thought it was kind of gross to eat chicken rice should be hot serving size was good and you will get to say you have eaten the cheapest michelin star meal in the world but i can honestly attest to the fact that the chicken rice here is just not that good,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i rated this place  star in tripadvisor for this reason had the description of  star rating is not poor but below average i would have rated it as  stars originally i wanted to visit the  michelin star rated liao fan hk chicken rice stall located at the chinatown food complex opposite this shop however unexpectedly it was closed on a tuesday so i am left with no choice but to try this branch with a lower rating of mere bib gourmand the experience was nothing short of a major disappointment my original intention was to simply write save as to the truly tenderness of chicken nothing is special the chicken is flavour less the soy sauce put on top of the rice does not make it taste different just normal soy sauce chilli sauce provided is a little weird in taste add on roasted pork is dry although the skin is indeed crispy food servers at the food collection counter has a terrible attitude problem they cannot be bothered to wait for a mere   seconds of walking time from table seated to the counter but will simply spam and abuses the bell extremely rude in manners simply swing the tray to your direction instead of placing it still for your collection i will not revisit this shop however i might still try hawker chan is chicken rice at the original shop in the food complex let is hope by the real man doing the dishes himself all these quality control defects can be eliminated and i get to enjoy a truly amazing plate of chicken rice note always try to visit the stall at second floor chinatown food complex and only take this shop as a backup plan the stall opens at   a m multiple reviews suggests that you can avoid the queue by being there at   a m the same reviews suggest that their chicken might be sold out as early as  p m according to michelin is website they are closed on wednesdays if you are coming straight from changi airport apparently the faster way of getting to this shop was to disembark at outram park mrt station east west line rather than chinatown mrt station visited  october  food ordered soya sauce chicken rice sgd   add on roasted pork sgd   major disappointment ordinary chicken rice,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i am surprised this does not have a review yet this is the first restaurant of recently rewarded chef chan who is a michelin starred chef his hawker stand which is rated cheapest michelin starred food in the world is not far front this restaurant see yelp link here yelp com biz hong kong s we chose to try this restaurant as it just opened nov  and i have got to say that the soy sauce chicken is superb it is nice that it is air conditioned as well we got there and the queue was not that long outside but when we left it snaked around and was on the street out of the queue barriers there is a queue outside the door and they let you in in bunches so you do not overwhelm the kitchen and ordering you either order at the counter register or get helped by someone at the ordering machine as well both seems effective and decently orderly you order pay get a number then grab your seat your number gets called and you pick up your order utensils hot sauce straws chilis are self service too the neat thing is chef chan was there putting out the food from the kitchen too there is a variety of menu combinations or alacarte you can choose from but basically soy sauce chicken char siew bbq pork roast pork roast pork ribs then there is rice wonton noodles hor fun wide flat rice noodles then veggies and drinks we ordered a full chicken s   combination meat of char siew and roast pork s  rice  and wonton noodles   and two drinks we basically had leftover chicken and a few pieces of the others but we knew that would happen overall as expected soy sauce chicken their specialty was by far the best one of the best soy sauce chickens i have ever had weakest was the roast pork in my opinion but still good because of the air conditioning the wonton noodles which are served dry with the soy sauce chicken sauceon it did not stay as warm as i would like but still was good the rice with the sauce was good with the chicken too i would recommend stopping by and queuing for this whether it be the restaurant or hawker if you are in singapore given that it is s   around   usd it is super affordable and yummy fyi hawker stall info is in the link above and very near the restaurant is hawker stall blk  smith street   chinatown food complex singapore opening hours  am to  pm mon tues thurs fri  am to  pm sat sun closed wedtip cash credit nets which is great for versatility of payment tip must try the soy sauce chicken tip very near the chinatown mrt purple north east line i believe exit a toward smith street is the proper exit,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,hawker chan is a must go when in singapore my first ever chicken rice was at tian tian so that is my standard hc is chicken and rice were both drier than tt is while hc is stands up well on its own i would vote tt in a heartbeat,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,lured by the allure of a michelin star hawker meal we checked this place out   for chicken rice and roast pork was a steal and the chicken was succulent and tender the roast pork was also great but lacked a certain crispness the rice was delicious all in all excellent but i was not completely blown away tian tian hainanese chicken rice in maxwell still wears the crown,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,by the last day of my trip i had eaten all of the above visited other hawker stalls and even enjoyed a  course meal at jaan named one of asia is  best restaurants in  with the bar set this high i finally arrived at hawker chan is when i stepped into the small restaurant i was surprised to see chef chan behind the glass brows furrowed and in deep concentration as he rapidly prepared rice and noodle plates for the lunch crowd to my surprise he looked up to wave when it was my turn to order at the counter i would soon learn that this display of warmth which was unexpected given his level of fame these past years was also somehow transferred to his food creations some say the difference between a good dish and an exemplary dish is that the latter is cooked with love as i placed the first spoonful of rice and chicken into my mouth i understood this sentiment every bite of chicken was tender and every morsel of rice fragrant chef chan turned this very ordinary dish into something amazing i looked around and watched as other customers customers from hong kong indonesia canada and beijing savored every bite lowdownonchinatown com h,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the good it is a local business service was friendly they take multiple forms of payment including contactless payment the chicken was very tender there are multiple options of chicken and pork and other offeringsthe bad i do not get it the chicken while cooked well was not anything to write home about the chicken was tasty and tender but nothing to justify in my opinion its michelin star i have eaten at plenty of food stalls while here in singapore and this place is chicken compares to other vendors offerings the chinese sausage while flavorful was very oily i would not recommend it with the noodles get it with the rice to help absorb the extra grease the bathrooms were dirty and very sketchy i think about employees using it or not using it then making customers food and it makes me a smidgeon queasy the queues depending on when you go it can be really lengthy or it can be normal i waited about   minutes to order my food then another  minutes for it to be done and ready to eat but i also went a random time in the day around  pm on a saturday if you go peak times prepare to waitthe ugly nonewould i go back honestly probably not there are a ton of other places in town that have food that is just as good and does not involve long queues there are far too many other delicious food hawkers in the game here and the food here did not justify the wait if i am in the area and there is not a wait i might go but that is a big might this place is in but not entirely enthusiastically,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,good experience if you are trying to get a taste of the local cuisine food quality is not that high but they kept their prices very low so you cannot really complain they serve their food fast and tables are almost always full of customers,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,wow soy sauce chicken was really tender and yummy love it the best with mein accept credit card with ac,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i would have regretted it if i left singapore without coming but i definitely cannot see myself recommending it to anyone with the hot long wait and mediocre food maybe i got very unlucky thoughfood i ordered the basic rice and chicken combo added some roast pork and a flower tea for s   total soy sauce chicken was more of a sweet style and lacked any real depth of soy sauce flavor or savoriness you could tell than there were aromatics in the braising liquid like orange peel the chicken was tender but almost to a gelatinous slippery feel and the chicken flavor was masked significantly by the sweetness of the sauce the hot sauce is also quite sweet and not really worth using roast pork was cut into nice small pieces and had a fairly good ratio of lean meat to juicy meat to crackling did lack a bit of crispness it was a bit more of a stale crunch but still decent the sauce on the chicken is not just regular soy but you can taste the seasonings from the braising process which is nice the tea has too much sugar and not enough flower would not recommend service experience staff is woefully unprepared which is why everything is so slow the kitchen is actually very fast and all the food is ready to go but the actual point of sale system seems to be flawed and this is why the wait is so damn long one cashier started taking my order but was abruptly stopped by someone else one of the cashiers doubles to clean the dining room and let in the next batch of customers i recommend coming back in a few months when hopefully the service improves,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,stopped in because of all the reviews and could not wait to eat the chicken rice that i heard so much about the line was at the door and the seats were full but the line moved quickly seating by the time we ordered was ok and the a c was good the food on the other hand was horrendous of course my husband and i ordered the chicken and rice and the chicken and noodles i wish i could have taken a picture of it but it would have made me ill looking at it i am not sure but maybe different places around the world consider the bone muscle red tendons to be a delicacy i do not it was one of the most disgusting things i have ever tried to eat save yourself the trouble pay whatever you have to to not eat here,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the original restaurant awarded with  michelin star is on the nd floor of the chinatown food complex we arrived at the restaurant at pm but was quickly turned away as they were already out of ingredients bummer on our way back to the mrt station however i caught sight of a restaurant where people were forming two lines to dine in lo and behold the sign stated liao fan hawker chan world is cheapest michelin star restaurant hawker chan had partnered and expanded his business and created a dine in restaurant near his original store though the queue two rows looked intimidating we decided to wait it out and see what the hype was about service though interaction with the staff is minimal i found the process self explanatory and efficient while waiting in line the staff brought us menus so we would know what we wanted to order by the time we got to the cashier after you place your order and pay they will give you a buzzer that will vibrate when your food is ready then you trade your buzzer for the food that you pick up to keep the flow going and meet the demand the staff were efficient in cleaning up they immediately seized the table to clean up as soon as the party leaves the table food simple menu options value meal it really lives up to the world is cheapest michelin star restaurant the soya chicken rice was only   the portion of one meal left me feeling just content i would recommend ordering side dishes if you want fully satisfy your hunger they were out of char siew when we ordered around  pm so we ordered the soya chicken rice and noodle both were delicious though i wished there were more greens in the meal atmosphere this is an up scale version of an hawker center clean and not as noisy as hawker centers overall i am glad that we ran into liao fan and tried it out,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,michelin should be ashamed of themselves by granting this place a star even in regards to the world is cheapest michelin starred meal you get what you pay for the soya sauce chicken was all bone skin and fat with very little meat the only things i found decent were the condiments and the soy sauce drippings on the bottom of the plate i tried to grasp the greatness this dish was known for and it fell flat for me though it was amusing to witness the tourists there instagramming and raving about the glorified dish sheep will be sheep i suppose i quickly got out of there to hail a taxi and the driver laughed when i told him about my experience at hawker chan he responded even place upstairs have better food and i believe it,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,tasty and love the sauce lou my brother brought home see yew kai or soya sauce chicken for our family it was delicately seasoned and i loved the soya sauce gravy that it sat in it was great with rice the chicken was tender and fell off the bone thank you lu shien t for sharing this delicious bird,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,had to come here when visiting singapore because of the michelin star was so disappointed there was no special flavor to the chicken actually there was barely any chicken at all was mostly bones the rice was dry and noodles were stuck together in one ball place was busy and it was hard to find seats i had eaten better rice and chicken not worth the visit,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,after it gotten its michelin hawkwer star for being the cheapest priced in the world i think hawker chan is staff forgotten its roots and humble beginning food is not just about food the rating is based on my nd rd visit it consistently disappoint me during my nd and rd visits used to be my favourite roasted meat seemed to be so hard and charred as though it is serving from last nite is leftovers horrendous its chicken wasnt the best in sg too similar tenderness can be found in other chicken rice stalls though they are not awarded the michelin starits noodle is also not the best in sg do read tripadvisor for more truthit should not embark so fast on a pompus expansion plan to bangkok taiwan etc ctrieshawker chan stall should be called chan geng that means in cantonese previously once now no longer a good hawker chan i think some were confused with the original stall at chinatown complex so i have to repeat my scoring at both places,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this review is for the original hawker stall yelp com biz hong kong s whose page now redirects here this was basically the only thing on my itinerary during a short layover in singapore and i was super excited to try it i waited in line for about  minutes and ordered a chicken rice and a roasted pork rice which came out to about   sgd i thought the place was a bit overhyped and that was partially my fault for reading up about it and watching videos beforehand the chicken was dry and a bit bland and honestly i felt that the pork was done better the owner was not there the day i went so i could chalk it up to that then again it is such a good deal that i would probably come back if the wait was not crazy there were quite a few popular hawker stalls in the vicinity though so it would be hard to justify waiting anything more than  minutes when a similar quality meal could be had from another vendor my tip to any travelers visiting the stall location bring something to fan yourself with or at least a bottle of water like the rest of singapore it was hot,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,known as one of the cheapest michelin rated restaurant in the world this is a must try when in singapore located within singapore is chinatown it is a close walk to many other hawker stalls serving up all kinds of asian fare the key to this place is to get here early as i showed up  min before it even opened and there was already  people in line the food is good and well worth the visit i ordered the chicken and rice plate as that was their most notable dish the prices are reasonable so i would suggest stocking up on two plates and sampling something else on the menu singapore has plenty of michelin rated restaurants and other great dining options so make sure to explore around and find some hidden gems within the city,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,soy sauce roasted chicken yes yes food here highly recommended however other served dishes are soso only come for their specialty very yummy not recommended for noodle and etc,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i will admit that the only reason i checked this place out was out of curiosity this place has had a certain amount of hype recently first of all this is a new location in a nice and clean restaurant which takes away from the street hawker experience but is probably more sanitary so i cannot complain i got what everyone recommended which was the soya chicken with noodles you can order at the kiosk or order at the counter and they will give you a number they have various drinks available and tiger beer which was really up charged the noodles were slightly cold but the chicken was warm so it was not an issue however they are a bit stingy with the vegetables the house made sambal sauce is yummy and so are the picked chilies their condiment game is on point my total was   which is slightly pricey for a hawker stall but you get extras such as air conditioning and food safety so it is worth it i noticed there were a lot of foreigners here more so than locals which concerned me but i think it was just my timing i enjoyed my meal and while it was not the best thing i ate in singapore it certainly is deserving of its michelin star,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i am not that into michellin but at this price you have no reason not to try i personally like the noodles better than the rices,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,awesome food at a bargain prices we paid s  for four dishes attached picture shows it all totally deserved michele stars,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,we ordered a sample of all they offer everything was well cooked and the seasoning was a little unique from the traditional it was all so tasty,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,from this duck slut to another this just was not good not tasty or appealing in any way could have been an off night,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,review for nov whew what a long line probably waited around an hour here during lunch hour but figured it would be worth the wait since it is a michelin star restaurant however maybe due to the hype or otherwise just struck me as a ok still would recommend going though for the experience,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,no wait at   pm on a weekday no wait meaning just  people in line ahead of us hardly had time to look at the menu before we we had to order and tables of  easy to find there were some tables of  available too but you may need to wait a few minutes food was served fast and it is nice to be able to sit down in a c while waiting for your order at the original stall no a c and you can be standing in line for a loooong time here you can take a seat and wait for your number to be called worth the convenience and comfort had the soya chicken rice veggies and fried beancurd all was good total price was  which is reasonable for the amount of food water was   which is a bit of a rip off so bring your own water,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i am really disappointed i have yet to try the main stall which most people say taste better the noodles here were extremely salty chicken had a lot of bones not much meat and char siew was also too salty i am singaporean and i have had better food at most other hawkers i wo not be coming back,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,inside stall sells out but much easier now to go to the new location across the street soya sauce chicken noodle do not mix with too much sauce and bbq pork rice awesome so perfect caramelized dark edges,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this place was definitely the hot spot in china town let is just say it lived up to the nearly  minute wait talk about flavorful must try with the pickled peppers not spicy at all,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,michelin one star cooking for less than the price of a mcdonald is big mac you can believe it the restaurant is on smith street near one of the big streets a business group may have helped him relocate to this present location do not know why yelp is using the restaurant name as liao fan hawker chan unless this signage means for non chinese speakers this is the hawker chan restaurant the english language signs show hawker chan the blue awnings mention the world is first michelin starred street food stall no experience of waiting in a queue for us although the restaurant is set up for long queues i ordered the chicken with noodles not rice and vegetables also a plate of the barbeque pork the food quality and consistency is superb and you get bragging rights for frugality finding a cheap eats mr chan deserves the accolades he has been given a video of the michelin award ceremony played on the video monitors in the restaurant while we ate,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this was honestly rubbish i came here already not expecting much but i was disappointed even further i guess my first mistake was expecting proper chicken rice whereas this place serves something more akin to white rice with a stingy pour of soy sauce over it the chicken was also lackluster while the top skin fat layer melts in your mouth it was nothing to write home about furthermore the long lines waits and jam packed crowds with little room to maneuver and most importantly the stink permeating the restaurant ensured that i will not be returning to this place my friends and i regretted not chancing upon the open air hawker stall area nearby further down smith st at which we would have gladly eaten instead,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the chicken was well done and relative to the price point a good meal i would not expect too much out of the meal it is after all the closest thing to a fast food joint that has a michelin star but you can see why the chicken is famous,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,saw this listed as a michelin starred hong kong soya sauce chicken rice in  was so happy to tried it out on my trip to singapore in dec  i went to the original store around  pm on a weekday it was closed and was directed by a sign to their new location which started less than a month ago during the end of nov many people like me were caught on a surprise anyway it was a short stroll from the hawker center to the new location basically across smith street of chinatown complex where the hawker center is wow the line was long spend more than an hour to get in just to order and as you can see why a  stars here is the summary service the staffs were very unpleasant somehow they were all burned out this new store was opened less than a month ago when i came or they were way under paid from the staff for maintaining the line to enter the restaurant just to enter the restaurant for standing in line to order the staff that guild you ordering via a kiosk and he will not let you touch it i tried to order myself as he was sllloooowwwwwww his mind is like  working and the  thinking about something else not work related i am sure it is just a koisk i know how to press on the things i want there is picture too but he gives me the look fine after order and received a pager attempt to locate a table while waiting for my food to be picked up as i was waiting i saw the staffs were slow at cleaning the table they were upset at people who removed used plates and placed on unoccupied tables people were cleaning tables themselves as they were waiting for the food when the pager rang time to pick up my food and asked the staff for condiments as it was almost empty the ladies just replied ok and ignored me i waited for more than  mins before someone came to fill i believe the other popular chicken rice store in maxwell food center did a better job organizing food the soya chicken was good but not to the extend for waiting for more than an hour or to die for i do like the taste but it is a little too sweet for me i do not mind the saltiness the chicken mixed well with either rice or noodle that is the only reason for a  starsprice way to high i am not comparing this with a hawker food center prices but a typical food court in a mall for the portion provided with respect to price it is consider very expensive generally a plate of chicken rice noddle comes with about a quarter of a chicken therefore a chicken can serve  plates of chicken rice noodle but for them for a chicken they serve  plates of chicken rice noodle you can imagine how little chicken you get for   person i will suggest half a chicken to share and not chicken rice noodle plate you will laugh at the portion for one person conclusion way overrated if you do visit singapore and you have not come here before i will say do visit this restaurant but do plan according standing in line for more than an hour is really waste of time or to die for do not expect service i believe hawker center do better than them,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,underwhelmed food was acceptable but i struggle to see how a michelin star is warranted i do not see this as anything special and there are other nearby hawkers selling more flavorful food for   the price,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the taste is authentic we liked the roast pork however the chicken were slightly dry slightly overpriced in my humble opinion but this is fairly worth it just fairly,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the sauce on the chicken was definitely tastier than the one other chicken and rice hawker we tried michelin star worthy questionable my husband had the chicken and noodles which i did not care for noodles had a fishy taste that i am not sure was intentional super crowded on a saturday at noon nice clean place air conditioning was on full blast too cold for me,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,saw the michelin interview of the owner and his story this was a must go to place when we visited singapore sadly i was disappointed i ordered everything on the menu the chicken was too salty and definitely have had better overall everything was super oily and we left most of the food still on the dishes hopefully it was an off day for the restaurant,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,very cheap but chicken rice is not hainanese other singapore chinese rice are much better this one tastes like very common chicken with white rice,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i was all hyped up to go and try this michelin rated restaurant however i am giving it  stars i think it is overrated you have to go early as the restaurant will get full fast it is a cheap meal dont get me wrong the chicken was ok i was hoping for warm meat smothered in his famous sauce all i got was room temperature chicken the side sauces were great but the side dishes were even better,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the new location is fine air conditioned and across the street from the hawker centre it is busy and finding a seat is a task the whole operation is efficient inexpensive and tasty for my friend and i it was a bit too sweet first few bites were great but after that the sweetness got to us,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,came here after reading that this was the cheapest michelin starred restaurant waited about  minutes in line before ordering we ordered a whole chicken rice and three meats char siew and siew yok the ordering system is pretty efficient there is a kiosk where one can order and pay by credit card or you can order old school at the counter after ordering they hand you a receipt with a number and when you see your number on the screen your order is ready to be picked up the chicken was good tender and flavorful but nothing mind blowing the char siew was okay could have done without overall it was good cheap food but nothing too memorable,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,lots of hype bc of the michelin star and for the value you sure cannot beat it however be aware that this is bone in chicken and they chop it with bone in meaning you will be chewing and spitting out lots of tiny bone fragments this is fairly normal in asia evidently but as an american i was not prepared for it away from that it very flavorful and an all around good experience do not expect this to be a fancy spot though just bc it has a michelin star think of it as maybe a step above a   in terms of ambiance,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,food  for a michelin star restaurant i was severely disappointed in the food to be fair this could be my fault i ordered the  bbq combo item this included bbq pork roasted pork belly and bbq ribs maybe i do not quite understand what michelin means especially for a hawker it is only after i sat down and looked at the screen and realize that they are known for their soy sauce chicken i thought michelin stars for for the restaurant as a whole not just one dish but i could be wrong maybe the soy sauce chicken is worth a try however i can say for an absolute fact that the  bbq combo i got was just pure trash bbq pork was not marbled in anyway and was completely dried and lacking in sauce roasted pork belly had barely any fat between the skin and meat on top of that the skin was dry and damp instead of having that oily crisp crunch ribs were dry as well and also lacking sauce as someone from the sgv area of socal even he most average chinese restaurant tops this place service  the line to order was not too bad and moved quickly for some odd reason people were lining up to order with the cashier but there was a order machine right next to them i skipped the lines and made a quick easy order using that i really enjoyed that and am a sucker for innovation so i am giving it a  because of that ambiance  you will notice i put hawker in quotes on the food section this is because it is not really a hawker it is a restaurant maybe at one point it was a hawker stall at the hawker centers but not anymore it is just a regular restaurant nothing special about it it is pretty bland but at least it is clean price  decent and cheap price however this is an american is point of view and food is generally cheaper for us because of the conversion rates,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i had to see for myself what the buzz with this first ever michelin starred hawker food stall is all about my husband and i lined up at  am and it was not until a little after noon that we finally had our chance to order we ordered the chicken rice and a plate of roasted pork total cost sing   the chicken was very tasty and tender with the meat falling off the bone it was truly worth the wait tip over order the servings are small so it would be wise to order a lot you do not want to regret not having ordered a lot because of how good it really tastes and also because of the long wait if you cannot finish it it is always good to take home,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,oh my god get the hor fun and char siu the best thing i have ever eaten and go early in the morning,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,definitely one of the best chicken rice in singapore this outlet has a much shorter queue than his hawker stall but is more expensive i still prefer buying from his hawker stall as it is always nice to see him there personally serving his customers,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,these are great cimbinations i ordered both rice and noodle no doubt for me when had tried roasted chicken its a to known things,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,just had to see what the buzz is all about the line was pretty long for a pm snack time waiters were a little cranky which is normal for bustling places food was alright not as good as i had expected but the sauce is definitely what separates it from the rest the place is really nice for a local fast food with lots of foreigners coming in out of the store,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,food sort justifies the price it tasted better the first time i tried maybe cos this round i was given chicken wings instead and there is not much meat there is also a very rude staff who disregarded my order cos she only wanted to know if i am dining or taking out then i had to repeat after answering her question she also took wrong orders from me and argued that i am in the wrong later she gave me the detested look and walked away like i am an unreasonable customer her colleague smiled and apologized for the wrong order i am not returning to this branch,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,cheap and good chicken is super tender and tasty its very crowded so come right at opening to get a table otherwise you will have to wait,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this place is totally overrated in particular the rice is both over cooked and served cold i have had this dish at many hawker stalls and this was not exceptional in any way this is a review of the restaurant not the original hawker center stall,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,thanks to yelp we stumbled upon this place without knowing it is michelin star so delicious and cheap probably the cheapest michelin star restaurant in the world there was a long queue outside and it took almost an hour to get in at lunch time well worth the wait we want to go back there again before we leave singapore anyone visiting chinatown this is a must stop,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i actually wrote my review for the hawker but we stumbled on the newly opened restaurant by mistake we were dropped off in the chinatown complex and walked through downstairs and did not see any food as we walk out i see the large banner and sign and immediately told my wife and kids to line up there were about  people ahead of us at  ish so the wait was about  mins during this time i walk with my son to the hawker center upstairs where we were to scope out the stall got lost and could not find it and came back by that time it was almost open and the queue was long i know ppl will swear by the stall and it is much cheaper but this place worked out well with the setup seating ac and the quick service amazing food of course the chicken but the three sleepers for me were the combo meat dish roast and bbq pork bay area spots cannot hang imo the two other sleepers were the awesome hot sauce and the awesome peppers sweet and spicy excellence the people in front of us were from australia i believe and the two families behind us were from ca as well as ourselves obviously they are reaching tourists later we walked around the hawker and saw the original and i saw the line crazy long but seemed to be efficient pumping out food,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,as of march  the one michelin star is awarded only for the original stall liao fan i understand the hawker chan outlets will be vying for a michelin star award later this year until then for me the real winner is the soya sauce chicken and even the sauce too all other dishes sides are alright but nothing special about them you can find equivalent quality for these other dishes sides elsewhere i have tried here twice and enjoy having the noodles with soya sauce chicken the rice seems quite popular here and so is the hor fun except that hor fun noodles do not arrive early my colleague ordered it at nn but was told the noodles were not in yet waiting in this restaurant is quite comfortable first you queue up to place an order as you get nearer the counter you will eventually have a choice of ordering via a vending machine or continue in the line to the counter staff people tend to take quite some time at the vending machine so i take that to mean it is not user friendly enough this ordering queue takes about   mins based on the before nn crowds after placing your order and paying up you will be given a receipt with a queue number now you can go to your seat and look out for the tv monitors that show the queue number for food collection so far diners there will just eat and go and not much lingering around so you should be able to get a table fairly quickly i will go back again just for the chicken,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,the food has been phenomenal laksa was awesome it was cheap yet heavy,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,when we got to this hawker center we immediately saw sungei road laksa as a line had formed after a small wait we got out bowl of delicious laksa the soup in the dish was delicious and had a nice coconut flavor to it the noodles were also smooth and the protein went well with dish overall it was a good bowl of laksa for the price you pay would eat here again if i am in singapore again,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,laksa is a popular southeast asia spicy noodle soup with rice noodle in coconut milk curry soup i am not a big fan of curry but had to try it out it was good and definitely worth a try if you can handle some heat even though i do not like curry i still enjoyed it sungei road seems to be the best but we also tried the laksa in the colony buffet in ritz carlton and thought the quality is pretty similar but this laksa is a fraction of the price  for a small bowl,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,laska is not my thing and after trying this still not my thing i love noodles and soup but i prefer simpler and clear broth although i am not a fan of this soup i can see why it is popular with the flavor profile of curry coconut and chili bowls are small but good size if you are from the americas think of it as a small chicken bowl size or a bowl of soboro don noodles are cut only utensils available are spoons which fits perfectly for every bite and easily able to get a spoonful of noodle and fish balls and cakes sgd how can you go wrong with something flavorful if it was my kind of food i would eat this again and again just like the locals do not be alarmed at the long line they serve it rather quickly it ai not no howlin rays kind of wait if you are from la,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,laksa here is so good tasty and rich in flavor line is always long but goes by pretty fast bowl is a bit small but its not pricy either love the combination of the fish cake cockles creamy coconut curry milk broth spices and noodles everything blended so well just slurp up all the liquid yumminess delicious and worth a visit,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,sungei road laksa was one of the more popular laksa selling places i found online when i arrived there was already a sizable line that had formed after i got in line another large wave of people appeared out of nowhere and the line pretty much doubled in size the amount of people waiting here speaks to its popularity the laksa was super cheap and looked delicious however the portion size was extremely small they do not give you chopsticks and only provide you with a small soup spoon to slurp up all of the noodles in the bowl but i did not find this to be a problem at all the coconut flavor was pretty strong but after i finished my bowl i found that the overall flavor was not as strong as i was expecting i liked the spices and seasoning in the broth as they were not overwhelmingly heavy i thought that i would still be starving after downing such a tiny bowl but i was surprisingly content that being said i easily could have had another bowl for me sungei road laksa was a delicious introduction to laksa first time trying it although the line here may deter some visitors i would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you are in the area,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,the bowls of laksa at sungei road laksa located in a small hawker center are small but packed with flavor you can tell this place is popular just from the lanes they have set up to organize guests waiting in line and for a cheap uniform price of  you get a flavor packed bowl of rice noodles in coconut milk curry broth topped with fish cake cockles herbs and chili paste on the side interestingly they also have a big sign on their stall that says no chopsticks and you are only given a spoon to eat the dish ensuring that you slurp up all the liquidy goodness,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,best laksa of life extremely affordable  for a small bowl broth made traditionally with charcoal creamy coconut milk paired with spices herbs and spicy sambal together create a sublime bowl of laksa i love the hint of freshness from raw clams sungei road laksa do not give out chopsticks but rather pre cut noodles so you can inhale it with a spoon the flavour profile really changes with every bite sambal clam herbs ouff tofu one of the best thing i ate in singapore i licked the bowl when no one is looking definitely worth traveling for,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,a little shop amongst   other little stands serving amazing authentic food no frills they are not there to entertain you walk up tell them how many bowls of the delicious yellow soup you would like pay and pick up your food no chopsticks provided at this shop which is kind of funny because you are eating noodles but the spoon will force you to slurp up all the soup along with the noodle not a bad idea actually this bowl is tiny especially compared to american standards i could probably eat  of these alone each bowl is only  so luckily i could comfortably afford all three bowls but i did not i wanted to save my stomach for all the other goodies around here fyi this was a tiny bit spicy just the way i like it and there are little clams in there so yummy in case you are allergic highly recommend,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,as soon as we landed in singapore we were planning our food adventure the first stop was sungei road laksa which was conveniently located within a  minute walk of our airbnb we shared a bowl of this delicious soup and were tempted to get more but knew that we had many other things to try i loved the creaminess from the coconut milk paired with all the spices to give this dish a nice kick,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,laksa so good there wo not be a line if you come early at  sgd this is a steal the broth was so creamy and delicious i wish i had doubled down on the order definitely worth the visit,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,the laksa here is so good and at  it really is a steal it is located at a hawker stall after reading the reviews about it being small my wife and i ordered  between us seemed to be a good amount for breakfast as other reviews mentioned there is no chopsticks but since the noodles were cut up i did not find this to be a problem at all,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,usd for a bowl of singaporean laksa the stuff most common in the states score the real deal chili turmeric lemongrass other fresh herbs and fermented shrimp all lovingly cooked off before adding shrimp stock clam stock and coconut milk simmered over a charcoal fire a handful of pre cooked noodles warm it by pouring the hot soup over it and dumping it out a few times add cockles and home made fish cake steamed over an open fire a little side of the chili base and that is it no chopsticks you eat this with a spoon the noodles are very soft overcooked by western standards but somehow it just works the flavor a punch to the palate is unmatched in depth and complexity very strong seafood flavor herbaceous notes rich from coconut with a long fermented finish it makes the laksa at the best place in my hometown taste like water in comparison washed down with a fresh squeezed calamansi juice to kill the spice satisfaction achieved ps because of the wood fire the flavor beats that of the more famous three number spot with gordon ramsay affiliation just saying,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,overall great laksa love the small bowl portion size i didnt enjoy the clams in it however and i picked them all out the food centre had large fans that def helped in cooling the place down to enjoy the food,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,this is a simple bowl of laksa no frills i like the renovated stall you only have one option now strictly  per bowl no upsize i saw people order two bowls for themselves after they requested for large and was told only one size it is not a big bowl but it can be filling especially when you also order a drink it is without chopsticks also stated clearly at the stall i think they got tired of people asking like the original katong laksa in katong it comes with just bean sprouts sliced fish cake slivers and cockles none of those fancy prawns taupok or even crayfish in other versions mix the chili into the gravy to get the red gravy we are used to seeing it is not that spicy now that i like cockles this is the place for my fix it is chockfull of it the first time i tried it was over  years ago before the renovation and i was not that into it maybe because it was hot and muggy plus i did not care for such a small bowl with simple ingredients then,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,worth the hype and the trek this seemingly humble bowl of  sd laksa is packed with a heavenly blend of sweet sour spicy and lots of umami after one spoonful i already wanted another bowl i arrived around am and waited only about   minutes building up my appetite as my eyes feasted on watching the aunties stirring and ladling big spoonfuls of soup over a charcoal stove the soup is fills you with umami and fresh cockles and packed with strong flavors of chili and curry all balanced out by sweet coconut milk which lightens the broth to be perfect a noodle soup is good when you drink it to the last drop and that is exactly what it did,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,good place to get decent laksarecommended but with caveats read on we were out shopping and in the mood for laksa and this place was highly recommended food we kept it simple and ordered only laksa and kueh pie tee from next door the laksa was flavorful even if the gravy was a bit thin it was available with cockles which was disappointing since some places will happily substitute prawns and they sell only one size which i would call small the kueh pie tee was tasty but with ground peanuts is not traditional nonya style cost at  for a bowl the laksa is an excellent value service good the queue was quite long but went quickly the uncles were quick to clear away the bowls after atmosphere this is a coffee shop no aircon overall if you are in the area and craving laksa it is definitely worth stopping here,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,the laksa here is definitely tasty and rich the laksa gravy is the main character of the dish i would give the taste of this dish  stars however i believe the service can be better when i came here during one of the saturdays the staff was able a bit rude and impatient to us on normal days they are fine i would recommend this to anyone who are looking for tasty and delicious laksa,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,sungei road laksa is frequently patronised by my family as the laksa gravy is milky rich and mildly spicy note that they wo not give you any chopsticks nor a fork as you will only eat with the given spoon the noodles are all cut into shorter lengths so you will have a easier time consuming it this goodness the price is relatively high for a extremely small bowl of laksa  but who cares if it is delicious,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,sgd for a delicious bowl of laksa served the traditional way with no chopsticks i came here at   in the morning and there was already a line with  people in front of me with only one item being served and only one size ordering was a breeze when it is your turn just let them know how many bowls when you are standing in the queue watching them prepare a bowl of laksa was fascinating all on its own as they use the broth to blanch your bowl of noodles multiple times the bowl is then topped off with a scoop of cockles and some homemade fish cake and definitely ask to get it spicy since they put the chili paste on the side of the bowl taking my first sip of the broth made me realize that all the laksa i have had before was by no means on par with sungei road the soup has layers upon layers of flavors starting from the sweetness of the coconut to the saltiness of the shrimp paste the complex blends that builds the curry and finally the spiciness from the chili paste eating a bowl of noodles without chopsticks is quite hard especially since the noodles are pretty long do not wear a white shirt by the way the bowl of laksa is small by comparison but a perfect size if you plan on eating something else afterwards,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,these small bowls of intensity are elevated by a scoop yes a scoop of cockles i would never seen anyone so cavalierly scoop spoonfuls of cockles out of a big bucket of cockles before to me cockles are things you laboriously pry open for minutes on end just for one sweet bite having  of them in one bowl was unimaginably decadent also the broth while it is coconutty that is not the dominant taste it is funky and green and very spicy if you choose to mix the whole dollop of chili in they do not let you use chopsticks which i do not understand unless it is to recreate the frustration of trying to get cockles out of their shells the noodles are too slippery and long to be held by the spoons and you end up slurping them right out of the bowl luckily that is not considered rude in asia,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,came at  am or so and there was a very minimal wait about   people ahead of me when i left around   there was a long queue of   people with   people ahead of me it took maybe   minutes to get through so it definitely goes by pretty quickly  sgd for this bowl of noodles the soup was good but not as rich as i expected for laksa one bowl is probably not enough for a meal but a great snack size the noodles were quite soft a bit too soft for my liking almost do not have to chew ordering system is a bit quirky you tell them how many bowls you want when there are still customers in front of you so they can start preparing them its quite interesting to watch them work it seems like they have the process down to a science the number of scoops of soup in and out of bowls etc and they work with a charcoal stove no chopsticks only spoons but they cut the noodles into spoon size portions for ultimate speedy consumption i would recommend trying,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,awesome place for laksa they only give spoons but luckily they cut the noodles so it was not too hard to eat the flavors are spicy and savory and they also had plenty of seafood pieces throughout the whole bowl,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,i never had laska in my life and was highly anticipating my visit to this shop while there were a lot of flavors going on i did not enjoy the dish and could not finish it even though the portion was small the seafood brininess was too overpowering for my liking  stars for,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,where to find a bowl of traditional and yummy laksa in singapore without burning a hole in your pocket well its right here at jalan berseh in a humble corner of a coffeeshop considering bowls of laksa that we had eaten before nowadays how many of them still have the gravy cook over charcoal fire there are a few stalls named sungei road laksa apparently they are not affiliated with this stall as they have openly declared on their signage that there are no other branches sungei road laksa is a family business and you can the family members each having their dedicated tasks you can observed the flow of their ordering process while you are in the long snaky queue what makes a perfect bowl of laksa i am not a fan of laksa with strong lemak coconut milk gravy and sungei road laksa has a well balance of all flavours in a simple  portion bowl just like the traditional way of eating there is no use of chopsticks for the noodles as the long noodles werelaksa gravy is not spicy and that is one of the reasons why i started loving it when i was a kid ingredients are simple with cockles slices of fishcakes laksa leaves and chilli to add some spicy kick to the bowl i would not say no to this comfort bowl of childhood favourite they are opened daily  am to pm but closed on wednesday i bet you will feel the same that the queue is worth waiting for,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,on a monday at  am no wait the clams so fresh so clean clean the fresh clams itself is worth  so i ordered two bowls if you are used to the us equivalent of a small pho bowl then you have to order two bowls i am sure there are better laksa places for the locals but this will do the job if you are visiting and wanted to see what the hype is all about,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,i prefer katong laksa over this place while they do seem to take the laksa making art more seriously at least by the expressions on their face for me the one size only small and the lighter broth does not win me over easily expect a lineup if you go during lunch hour repeat no,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,easily a five stars review but i also procrastinate to write easily easy menu options small bowl  or big bowl  out of town visitors from my motherland in queue in front of me were debating what they should order i had to step in and yelp they then proceeded to show me photos of rojak so i said only laksa here and no it is not the katong kind the sign above the stall clearly says sungei road laksa in any case once it is your turn to order just say big or small and perhaps how many thanks easy on the wallet and stomach cheap and not too jelak cloyingly rich yes even the big bowl may not be enough for the ravenously hangry but remember everything in moderation and you might live to  so yes the easiest part about coming here is finishing that small bowl if you are not fuss about how cooked your cockles are you can be done in  mins if you prefer less bloodiness submerge your cockles and leave to sit for a minute or two still you can easily up and go mins after receiving your bowl that is where the easy parts end folks get the timing right some have missed out because they keep coming on a wednesday when they are closed also they are more a morning lunch business so come early as they will close as and when they sell out the queue can be long but it does move fast however you might still sweat a little as it is rather hot and stuffy in this coffeeshop the essential use of charcoal fire ensures the right temperature and imparts a smokiness that cannot be replicated otherwise so it is anything but easy to make that tiny bowl just look at the prep that goes on behind the scene before each bowl can be slurped finally coming here is also not easy not near mrt or bus station walking is required unless you drive uber grab or cab here nevertheless i can easily predict that you will be back,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,laksa is a must try dish while visiting singapore and sungei road laksa is your must go place to get laksa in singapore yelpers gave another great suggestion and this place definitely did not disappoint the place is located in a more residential part of town i actually took a taxi here as it was not very close to any subways stations but it was so worth it its one of  stalls in a smaller hawker center so order your food watch them cook it and take your order to any open table they only sell one item not even drinks but its so good their laksa broth is creamy and flavorful yet still light you get a choice of spicy or not spicy the spicy comes with a spoonful of chili sauce get it spicy as it provides a good kick without the burning sensation i rarely ever finish the soup when i eat noodles as i always feel like restaurant soup noodles use a lot of msg or salt in their soup however this was one of those times where i drank all the soup licked the bowl and still wanted more i love the cockles they have in the soup it has that seafood freshness and sweet taste which i have never had before the bowl is really small but is only  sgd the taxi driver suggested i order  bowls since the bowls are small he was right and  bowls were just perfect they do not sell drinks instead you will see a lady come by from another stall taking drink orders i brought my own bottled water so i declined but the lady sells juices and beer there is also another old lady that comes by to sell you tissue packets just in case you were not carrying any on you no napkins provided here either fyi they do not give you chopsticks for these noodles and you do not really need them the spoon they provide is enough to finish all the noodles and soup,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,was looking forward to visiting this place when traveling in singapore because of the great reviews unfortunately laksa did not taste good at all could not finish it they had no pictures sign i found that a bit ridiculous,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,outstanding laksa in an informal setting long lines but worth the wait do not miss it if you want great laksa,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,truly this place deserves a  rating this place is small and lunch room style seating but the food is so damn good if you are in singapore and want laksa this is the place to be always a long line but worth the wait staff are friendly and you simply pay by the bowl no other options here it is only  sgd so i feel that this is a great deal,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,is very very cheap considering the price of singapore food these days the queue is massive however and it makes me think twice whether or not the time spent was worth it ok i have thought twice it is totally worth it i had not had such a satisfying  bowls of laksa meal for a long while,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,this is really as good as it gets the only thing that could beat the rating would be if this is in an air conditioned food court the laksa gravy is not too thick and it brought out the goodness in the creamy not so spicy soup even though the bowl of laksa only costs  but i always take a cab to eat it since it is pretty far from my place but as you know it just means it is worth more than  since i am willing to cab over,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,came here because of the positive yelp reviews a bowl is only  it is good if you like a creamy curry taste and do not mind the hunks of fish that taste really fishy the noodles are really good,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,i ate the best bowl of laksa at sungei road laksa and i think now there is no turning back my sister was complaining when i made her follow me and took the trek to have mid morning snack maybe i should took a taxi but my google map app told me that it was like  minute walk from my hotel but it was all worth it when she ate that whole bowl all by herself it was empty and she even drank all the soup when i went and get us a barley drink i ended up getting one for myself it only cost  the soup base has so much depth spicy sweet salty and creamy i love the cockies i love the noodle i love how i can eat the whole thing with a spoon worth getting there early to beat the rush as it was not busy at all when i was there i can have a few more rounds if i wanted maybe i should have a few more bowls extra spicy please,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,caveat i am probably not qualified to write this review i had only tried laksa a couple times before at sit down restaurants which likely have a completely different approach to this dish anyway being in singapore i knew i had to come and try an authentic bowl of laksa after reading a few google hits on best laksa in singapore i saw that this place consistently was mentioned and was closest to my hotel my mom will walk nowhere in the heat so we came here it was located inside a pretty archetypal hawker market not the cleaner style newer ones that are inside and air conditioned but an open air alcove of food stalls with just a few ceiling fans to combat the heat note this place does have bathrooms that do not charge which is a plus for a hawker market anyway the sungie road laksa stall is located in one of the corners to the market i am pretty sure they only serve this one dish so it is pretty efficient service however note that they do not provide chopsticks which i found weird although the laksa noodles are cut short they still do not fit that well onto the spoon and chopsticks would have been helpful moving on i ordered a bowl for myself and a bowl for my dad i guess the first thing i noticed was that this version did not have prawns which i thought was a sine qua non for laksa it had only fish cakes and what i thought were clams but what my singaporean mom said were cockles so i guess they were cockles it was not aesthetically pleasing like the laksa i had seen before also while i used to love them i am not a huge fan of bivalves anymore because they kind of taste like sand and saltwater to me now also they look gross but how did the whole thing taste the broth was tasty though it started getting very spicy toward the end because i mixed the entire dollop of chili paste into my broth definitely buy a chaser of water with this dish the fish cakes had a very light flavor to them however the cockles tasted like the aforementioned saltwater and sand which i did not prefer but ate anyway because i was starving overall i guess i was just expecting more more seafood more flavor more presentation but my singaporean dad who grew up eating laksa said it was one of the best he had ever had so i guess it is probably really good to people who know what they are talking about,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,normally the queue is huge but today there was none so quickly took the opportunity to try this place the broth is tasty and better than most singaporean laksa places but lacked the oomph i am used to from malaysian varieties a good massive dose of sambal would help otherwise for  a bowl it is a pretty good deal,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,slap your momma good haha really for the price and what you get you this is a cannot miss if you are visitor to singapore and want to get some laksa you might want to try couple of places before here because it ai not the same anywhere else either you think something costs way more than here or it is not as good suck it up stand in line get large bowls of laksa sit down and slurp i was expecting half hype half failure when i stood in line but i was pretty much blown away by the price point and the quality of food first of all the color of it look amazing than the amount of fresh cockles you get in your order was way more than what  will get you i was expecting  or  pieces but it was a nice big spoonful of them i went for a late lunch so the line was not as bad it seemed liked all the other food stalls were dead except here come here get in line and slurp away,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,absolutely delicious straightforward bowl of laksa for a good value i really enjoyed the cockles and how the flavors were a great blend i just wish they had larger sized portions but with only  sd a bowl getting multiples is an easy solution,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,best laksa packed with huge favors i ordered  bowls for lunch i came back the next day for another  bowls before leaving singapore worth it,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,they only have one size and a bowl of laksa costs  sgd only came here pretty early and after thirty minutes there were long lines i thought the soup was okay i was able to eat it all as the portions are small it might be because the cockles had a super strong seafood taste that slightly turned me off the soup itself was good and enjoyable they only give spoon which made it a little difficult to eat the noodles,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,while i cannot profess to be a connoisseur of laksa as a speciality dish i will say that i know a bowl of tasty when it is put in front of me for foreigners and visitors alike this laksa stall is the perfect example of a local no frills hawker if you want to experience the authentic experience the laksa itself is well balanced and is not overly rich like many others i have tasted the noodles are cooked well and the slices of fish cakes and herbs that top off the dish is just perfect note that this does come with fresh raw cockles as i once heard something about cockles carrying hepatitis i pick those out all in all this is a great deal for only sgd,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,i like my laksa chock full of seafoody goodness so this really hit the spot served with cockles and sliced fish cake only no chicken prawns or taupok this is the first time i have had laksa with only a spoon and i now appreciate why they do so it really tastes fantastic when you slurp it all up by the spoonful they heat the laksa stock over charcoal not sure if it adds to the flavour per se but whatever they are doing works i went there at about   pm and business was still brisk queue was not long but it was still a good   wait,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,simply put delicious laksa i could not complain about anything at all the ingredients were perfect thanks,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,craving for a bowl of good affordable laksa this is one place you will find it located at jalan berseh road near the jalan berseh food centre along the old sungei road is a small hawker centre where this bowl of traditional laksa is served prepared in the old style of cooking in a charcoal stove the gravy is excellent till the last drop it is not too thick nor spicy it is just right the aroma of this laksa will draw you to them excite your tastebuds it is a favorite of the businees crowd and the residents of the area if you are up for something traditional and local this is one you must must try,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,really good laksa and it is only  a bowl well worth it it is the only thing they do and they do it really well a bit off the beaten path but definitely the trip,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,it is worth trying just remember to bring your own chopsticks i purchased a pair from a supermarket before when for it,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,this place was highly recommended i was so disappointed when i tasted it the laksa i had in malaysia is way better than this the laksa was lukewarm in temperature and should be warm the taste was a bit bland but the ingredients were ok,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,i know i should not be expecting flavorful curry that packs a punch quite a bit of spice with singaporean curry laksa but i was still slightly disappointed by my bowl of laksa here while it made a decent albeit small meal it was not necessarily my favorite and did not leave me impressed unsure that i would make the trip out here again just for the laksa it is cheap though  for a small bowl,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,totally disappointed heard and saw lots of good review before visit the soup based is cooked with gas and warm only via charcoal soup base is above the normal salt level can taste that their soup is much more salty than most soup based not thick as mentioned in other review conclusion not worth the time and surely a disappointment tried yesterday st oct  afternoon,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,in local speak very good lah this is my favorite katong laksa place i come here straight from the airport and also make an attempt to come here before i leave katong laksa being a signature singaporean dish it is also unique in its own right that you do not eat it with fork or chopsticks but only with a spoon i guess that is where half the flavor comes from the broth it is tasty and cheap  for that it gets  stars alone not to mention it is cooked on a charcoal fired stove which adds to the flavor this particular place is a family business and very recently got passed down to the next generation so i am very happy that we can still enjoy the cheap and tasty goodness that this place has to offer the best time to come is around opening time  am or late lunchtime around pm otherwise expect a long queue personally the morning is the best as the food is the freshest,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,hands down the best laksa i had in singapore i am not singaporean so not sure about the authenticity but just by looking at the way the laksa is prepared i doubt little has changed over the many years full respect to the owner for maintaining the tradition and flavour for so long,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,officially my favorite laksa in singapore i had the best bowl of laksa today despite the heat and insanely long line i enjoyed every bite and slurp you will slurp i guarantee the soup is cooked on a charcoal stove and continually stirred the cook looked very serious going at her craft so it raised my expectations not too creamy it does not make you feel sick by the end of the meal and the portion is really kinda small so you should have two bowls i made the mistake of ordering just one then i saw the couple next to me get three to share between them two argh the line i did not bother to re line up now i know come here seriously laksa eaters,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,really long line and pretty good eats but do not be fooled by the  price tag the portions are pretty small so you might want to go ahead and order two i am pretty sure you wo not want to wait in line again i read about this place in my in flight magazine and apparently they cut up their noodles so that the entire dish can be eaten with just a spoon how efficient,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,this is the most delicious laksa that i have ever had on my entire singapore trip cockles were sweet and fresh the laksa noodles were al dente and the broth is amazingly tasty the broth has bold flavors of coconut milk shrimp paste spice paste etc you wo not get thirsty after having this soup but you may want to get a jug of sugarcane juice or barley soup to cease the fire the only cons that i can think of is the long queue this place has no airconditioning and the queue is long however watching uncle make the broth on the charcoal fire in a bronze soup pan is quite entertaining his facial expressions look very calm and zen even in this kind of hot weather the way how he stirs the broth is like exercising tai chi it is definitely worth waiting for it i highly recommend my yelpers to have sungei road laksa,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,best laksa in town but they increased their price to  bowl for a small bowl still long q during peak hours really disappointed in the price increased,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,if you are looking for authenticity this is probably as good as it gets this stall is one of many on the floor with plastic chairs and tables in the eating area and can be easily spotted by the queue that is formed in front of it i decided to check it out as i love laksa and was intrigued by the good yelp reviews after queuing for what seemed like ages i got a small bowl with steaming laksa and from what i could make out lots of cockles the broth was not overly spicy and not thick and rich enough for my taste but good and the noodles were ok pre cut to provide for easier eating all for  singapore dollars ca   eur drinks are ordered from the ladies circling the tables and paid directly with them the atmosphere is really very authentic i was the only caucasian eating there today and it is a nice refuge from the rain in monsoon season i escaped a total downpour walking into the stall area if you are really hungry one bowl wo not suffice though but you will be spoiled for choice as to what to eat next from the other stalls i have had better laksa but for the price and the atmosphere i was glad to have tried it out and you should too,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,raw cockles charcoal fired laksa soup eat it with a spoon this has to be the most old school laksa stall left picked by celebrity chef andre chang as his pick for singapore started in  this food stall vendor still uses charcoal to boil his laksa soup and the price is still only  it is the place where i can find the most authentic laksa flavor in singapore andr chiang restaurant andre singapore,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,i am not a laksa person but this is a good bowl of laksa the soup is very flavorful rich and thick bring a pot there buy the soup home have a laksa party and make many happy tummies,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,fantastic laksa possibly the best in singapore the bowls are fairly small so it is usually the case that i have to have two to fill myself up not inexpensive but worth it,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,sungei road laksa may serve up one of the simplest bowls of laksa without modern adornments like eggs prawns or otah but what they lack in frills they compensate with freshness and quality the illustrious heritage hawker still uses charcoal to fire up his stove and if you ever thought it was no biggie to use charcoal fire sungei road laksa will change your mind it is immediately evident that the smoky char of the fire imbues each bowl of laksa with an irresistibly heady aroma the queues may be legendary but clockwork efficient production of the noodles ensures the line moves fast but if you are really averse to waiting in line the best time to hit up sungei road laksa is after the peak lunch hours on weekdays there is hardly a queue then the standard order laksa  is loaded with beansprouts fishcake and cockles the cockles though petite are swimmingly fresh and succulent and lend a briny accent to the rich and robust gravy if you can take the heat ask for extra helpings of the sambal chilli to stir into the gravy it adds a potent punch and complements the laksa base,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,good laksa use to eat there years ago when it was only cts now is already over  but the laksa is still good strong laksa favor,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,why is this one of the best laksas in singapore with  katong laksa trailing behind the soup alone has me won over hands down with a great mix of coconut milk spice paste rempah and savoury dried shrimp the laksa broth was adequately creamy yet not too overly spicy so one can just consume it at one shot if you would like it more spicy their sambal provided can be mixed in the cockles and fishcake slices used were good quality ingredients that were fresh off the shelves in the supermarket what is best is that it is only  where can you find such delicious food at such a great price,Positive
sungei-road-laksa,best laksa in the city it is not a restaurant it is not even a cafe just the place where some people cook this great soup for just s,Negative
sungei-road-laksa,the laksa itself was served like katong laksa style with only a spoon and no chopsticks what was visually appealing was the explosion of colors brimming from side to side the redness of the cockles matched beautifully with the green of the parsley and the yellowish broth the broth itself was very light not lemak like katong laksa but it was because of this lightness that i especially enjoyed a tinge of refreshing sweetness infused with the coconutty flavors gorgeous laksathe cockles were not only huge but very abundantly generous the textures were just amazing cooked to perfection the noodles and bean sprouts added the much needed texture and color as well it was so delicious that i literally had  and a half bowls at one go and let me say i rarely consume so much food at one go every bit of laksa flavor had me intoxicated and just clamoring for more,Positive
cut,celebrated my nieces birthday dinner here first time to cut and it was awesome kobe beef steak was incredible as was the service thank you,Positive
cut,one star michelin steakhouse in mbs expensive high quality steak had the trio of beef to sample different cuts new york sirloin wagyu and usda prime both the ny sirloin and the usda prime were top notch but the wagyu was a let down definitely had better wagyu beef elsewhere portions are small especially when considering the price so overall the steak alone would be  star starters are amazing we ordered the sauted mushroom and patatas bravas definitely one of the best starters i have had in a whileif you do not eat beef the pork chop is excellent juicy and tender with a very good complementary sauce large wine selection but unfortunately sommelier was not the most helpful we asked for a red wine recommendation and he basically pointed to so many that it misses the point of being a recommendationservice was really slow and not attentive definitely not what we would expect from this type of restaurant mediocre service counters the  star starters to give a  rating,Negative
cut,i have been craving for steak this past week and finally decided to stop by this location the filet mignon was tender flavorful and delicious i was too hungry so i devoured it before taking any pictures the bone marrow was mouth watering all staff members were attentive without being too excessive glynn the manager at cut definitely made my short visit to singapore a   experience she volunteered to call the souvenir shop within marina bay hotel twice to verify its location and look up some information for me glynn also recommended a popular drink of the restaurant rough love unique and easy to drink you should try it i attached the picture below thank you everyone at the cut for an amazing meal and experience,Positive
cut,superb service you cannot expect anything less from wolfgang puck is restaurant and it is at the marina bay sands hotel so the standards are high when dining here plenty of steaks to choose from they also make some good cocktails again service was great they kept coming back ensuring that my needs were met reservations are recommended although i am sure they can squeeze you in,Positive
cut,just wanted to say thanks to mary and the people at cut who made for a very special evening had the porterhouse for  perfectly cooked to medium rare service was excellent was given a nice little surprise at the end of the meal to celebrate an engagement i am glad i chose this place it was worth it,Positive
cut,one of the best steaks i have ever tasted we went with the porterhouse steak and it was good for two people portion wise it comes with two sauces and  different mustards the steak was very well prepared in terms of flavor and we really enjoyed it ordered kale and the patata as sides the patata was really good as well finally went with the chocolate and the caramel dishes for dessert they were ok but nothing special would not mind skipping them next time,Positive
cut,i recommend making reservations because as a walk in they are most likely going to seat you in the lounge where shoppers gawk at you through the window as they walk by not a great ambiance all things considered the steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it i would not order it again truthfully the menu is pretty straightforward i wanted the porterhouse so jerry and i ordered the portion for  little did we know it is  piece cooked and divided in half i wanted rare and he wanted medium rare it was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it they then walked over to jerry to confirm his medium rare wishes so they can continue to cook it i got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items i forgot what it was but i remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste presentation and quality of the food the bone marrow was tender it melted in my mouth it was so rich i felt guilty as i was eating it but it was too good to stop i wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though the porterhouse was tender their house made steak sauce was delicious the steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so i kept adding finally time for desserts i was the only one that wanted desserts i ordered the chocolate souffl knew that it would take at least  minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out the portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but i do not share when it comes to food so i enjoyed it orgasmiscally until it was all gone their crime fraiche was thick and creamy the chocolate sauce was rich the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w the huge decadent and delicious chocolate souffl service was impeccable  off for mastercard users thanks for allowing us to expense this love my company,Negative
cut,mr puck is next to arnie one of the more famous and successful austrian exports he now ranks amongst the best chefs restaurateurs in the world and spago in la is an institution that has found worldwide fame now present in many locations singapore included another venture of his is cut focusing on steak we booked there for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed it tremendously as there are many other reviews raving about this place i am trying to keep it short hoping to contribute to a coherent picture service is very friendly efficient and which i always find refreshing at celebrity restaurants authentic no snobbishness just smiles all around staff greeting repeat customers with true joy of seeing each other again a rare trait at this kind of place interior is modern elegant darkish with great lighting and the wonderful celebrity portrait photography by martin schoeller featured in the entire location and on menus food is delicious i wo not go into detail we had crab shrimp cocktail starters steak and dessert and it arrives pretty fast which we did not expect with the restaurant being very busy the wine list features a great many choices and we really enjoyed our pinot noir from california prices for wine are on the steep side but i guess this is not news to anyone in singapore i really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics e g david bowie and contemporary e g coldplay a daring choice but a good change from the usual toilets are very sleek and very clean and so big i cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting gucci post dinner did not work for me but one can always try,Positive
cut,came here on a pretty amazing random whim with a great gentleman his crew while visiting singapore my goodness the presentation flavor of the drinks food were amazing and orgasmic how they made carrots mac cheese mini kobe burgers fish tacos potatoes all separate dishes taste like culinary heaven is beyond me the bartender and servers were courteous lively which definitely amped up the atmosphere i thoroughly enjoyed myself,Positive
cut,this has got to be the best steak house i have ever experienced i am formerly of new york city and had my fair share of solid steaks i have even frequented cut restaurants in other locations including los angeles and dubai but for some reason the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best cut but also one of the best restaurants in singapore what also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection their cocktails definitely among the best in singapore fresh ingredients and creative mixology similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff the only ones i have found in sg so far that can even compare to the creations here are bar stories on arab st and nutmeg and clove on club st you can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy my favorite is duke of earl a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin also love their spiked thai iced tea anyways for the food their kobe beef is unreal frankly you cannot go wrong with any of their steaks lastly their dessert they also have the best dessert i have ever had in my life highly recommend their baked alaska which has kaya ice cream inside unreal make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons drinks steaks dessert every person i have brought here ends up loving it as much as i do and for good cause you wo not be disappointed,Positive
cut,event planners beware i am an event planner and had a very disappointing experience i gave  stars because the food and service was good the management team organizing was not i felt they were dishonest with the amount of wine my group consumed which we have no choice but to pay because i was not onsite to confirm i was also charged a higher amount on wine as they did not have the type i chose of which i am still awaiting a refund from early march the communication has been slow and not genuine my concerns were expressed multiple times and still have not heard from a manager,Negative
cut,i took my husband here for his birthday while in singapore and this is hands down one of the best restaurants we have been to the server was a so was dinner my favorite was my mocktail apple cucumber basil what a great experience needless to say he enjoyed his birthday,Positive
cut,best steaks in town the kobe steak is just amazing i had the filet mignon the pork belly starter was also really good,Positive
cut,this is probably the best steak house in singapore we ordered the wagu grade  steak it literally melt in our mouths we started with the tuna tartar excellentthen we had the steak that was shared heaven wine was ok on the expensive side they wo not allowed us to bring our own a bit of a downer we finished with sweet port n chocolate souffl a highly recommended place if u are willing to spend at least  per person,Positive
cut,i took myself on valentine is day after working a long day for starters the bread was delish i preferred the pretzel bun with the soft butter i ordered a nice glass of red wine with help from their sommelier i also got the ribeye and the potatoes the ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare and it was a nice cut those potatoes were fabulous roasted smashed then crisped and garnished with lots of savory onions for dessert i splurged and got the chocolate souffl oh my goodness this is literally in my top  desserts ever it was just pure delight and not too chocolatey when the souffl arrived the waiter topped it with melted chocolate a dollop of whip cream and then topped it with more chocolate gah i also got a glass of sweet red wine which was a nice accompaniment to the souffl i am drooling now as i think of that delicious meal enjoy oh and i almost forgot they gave me a long stem red rose and a box of homemade chocolates they were fabulous i did not see them give them to the guys at the table next to me so thanks for making my day,Positive
cut,dined here a few weeks ago crab cakes butter lettuce filet with the apple crumble dessert enjoyed it very much filet was excellently prepared would definitely return here next time,Positive
cut,i really do not have much negatives to say about this place despite it being twice as more expensive than the la version which usually annoys me from what i recall they had some kind of discounts if you make it before the happy hour ends we came here for our anniversary dinner few months back and the service atmosphere and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration i am a bone marrow fan and it did not disappoint unlike the one in osteria mozza across the street though i am also a long time fan of that restaurant it was juicy flavorful and exactly messy and authentic as the ones i would eat in new york d usually gets the rib eye and i get the filet mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish and both were on point on the side caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair overall a place to go in singapore when you are missing some good quality meat in your life,Positive
cut,the exterior of the restaurant was intimidating but thankfully i had the courage to walk in and order a drink at the bar because it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life sorry for the exaggeration the bar menu was reasonable in price not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu and they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn and when they say gourmet they mean gourmet their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with parmesan cheese i am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich sounding cocktail concoctions the super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and i ended up with a drink called dying love i may be mistaken but sounds like it the drink was visually gorgeous a raspberry resting on a slab of ice floating on a pink sea similar to the movies titanic and life of pi from the bar menu i ordered the mini steak burgers  small ones on a cute white plate while they are small trust me they are enough to fill you up as an added bonus they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu so it is a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending  dollars all in all cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants i have been to i have yet to try their fine dining area but from my initial experience at the bar i am sure i wo not be disappointed when that time comes,Positive
cut,cut is on the playing field with the top tier of steakhouses in the world offering top cuts of beef imported from the leading beef nations including waygu beef from japan the menu and the atmosphere were certainly more of what i would expect in a west coast or las vegas steakhouse no surprise contemporary minimalist furnishing and decor small plates with a modern cuisine flair like shrimp cocktail with a wasabi panna cotta and delicate yuzu sauce the us angus filet i had was absolutely spot on and delicious the wine list had a pretty good range in the by the glass selection and the bar had a good variety of cocktails classic and innovative both stylistically i prefer the old school new york chicago style steakhouses this i would not categorize as traditional american restaurants where the emphasis is on the excellence of the ingredients and mastery of basic dishes that compliment the centerpiece of the meal so while i enjoyed my experience the match goes to other team particularly when one considers that this player has a bigger paycheck than who it is up against,Positive
cut,do not get me wrong this is a great restaurant but i would never recommend it to anyone as it is massively over priced the food is excellent and the service quite good i had the pork belly as a starter and it was melt in the mouth perfection my husband and i shared the porterhouse which was delicious and perfectly cooked the onion rings are excellent as well exactly the way you always hope they will be but rarely are i had the s mores for dessert and loved them the wine menu is seriously extensive as is the cocktail menu i loved the music but not sure that the ramones would be to every diner is liking but  for dinner for two at a steak house is far too much in my opinion the mark up on wine is huge i just cannot justify the cost,Positive
cut,beyond being the best steak restaurant in singapore cut won my heart forever when manager glynn came to my rescue during a whisky and food tasting event that took place early in my pregnancy as it was just only  months into my first trimester at the time i was still holding off on telling my colleagues happily ordering mocktails on the sly with high end whisky the tastings were in small glasses and i pulled manager glynn aside on my way to the ladies room to explain my challenge luckily glynn managed to subtly replace my whisky with tea same color and i was unable to enjoy the evening stress free the food was exquisite as always my favorites included the bone marrow flan the blue crab and shrimp louis the pork belly the steak and the pear crumble parting thought we are going back to celebrate getting to the second trimester,Positive
cut,i have been dying to try this place for a while now finally got to try it last night ordered the u s filet mignon uk ribeye hokkaido scallop carpaccio creamed spinach wild mushrooms the cook on the filet mignon was great the portions were just right for my boyfriend and i though we were stuffed at the end of the meal we could not help but try their desserts the kaya baked alaska was to die for it was not too sweet so it was perfect also had the sweet wine port,Positive
cut,the place i go to for my gin tonic fix just cause they make the best one around as for the steak i wo not say it is out of the world kinda standard but it is decent with a hefty price tagged to it besides that the souffle and the creamed spinach is a must have when you are there regarding the ambiance i find that the dining area is rather dark and probably due to how the restaurant is layout the noise sound bounces off the wall which kinda make the place really noisy loud when people start chitter chattering the night away which make it hard to carry conversation properly however the bar area is just perfect to be honest i rather be sitting at the bar area to have my dinner than the dining area nonetheless i cannot wait to head back there for rounds of g t already,Positive
cut,awesomeness this review is overdue and i finally found time to write it i visited the other cut locations as well and am a regular here at cut singapore in particular the one in beverly hills i found the whole setup and service here in singapore much warmer and more pleasant with better service as well if you are used to cold shoulder service think again and visit cut the seating was nice and a short notice table was not a problem though not sure that is because my name popped up in their computer the staff was and is always polite professional and naturally friendly a  experience note that it is a pricey experience as well though think   for a two person meal but worth it you will be presented with the various options of meat and the server explains to you what the specifics of the meat are i personally like the bone in filet mignon medium rare paired with a nice red wine this time we chose an argentinian malbec a pleasure to drink note that i am not even pretending to be a wine expert at all i just like to drink what tastes well to me and so far argentinian wines did not disappoint me in any way the young lady who presented the wine was super friendly as always the steak came together with the sides which this time consisted of mushrooms and spinach the highlight ladies and gentlemen is the dessert have the chocolate souffle and you with either foodgasm or die and go to heaven or a combination of both right at the table so if you are looking for your perfect dining experience come here and you wo not regret it enjoy s,Positive
cut,quite expensive but truly worth the price i feel i just loved the mocktail being served here streaks are also quite tasty,Positive
cut,the beef steak at cut totally blew my mind i do not even like steak that much and i never had a craving for steak before but my experience at cut have changed this the cocktails were absolutely amazing too all prepared beautifully tasted great and packed a nice punch i would totally come back here just for a drink next time the down side of this restaurant would be their steep prices but the location food and drinks here do justify it,Negative
cut,went here for dinner i had the australian porter house my steak was bland no flavor and had a lot of fat not trimmed and rare was done as medium well informed my waiter and she just said she will let manager know,Negative
cut,fantastic food cocktails and service we had chips and mini burgers in the lounge area and two cocktails each followed up by the chocolate souffl the chips were wonderful my husband loved the sliders i did not try them since i am vegetarian and the cocktails were delicious the true hero of the meal though was the souffl it was delivered with a flourish and an explanation and it was wonderful the service from the bar staff was fantastic they were attentive without being suffocating and they were good at making suggestions highly recommended,Positive
cut,cut holds up with the best steakhouses i have been to in the usa australia and europe we started our meal with the bone marrow flan it was fantastic it was rich and buttery the garnish went perfectly with the marrow on top of a nice piece of toast i was impressed additionally the complimentary selection of breads rolls and breadsticks were all pretty impressive it is hard not to fill up on them but you should resist for our main i split the porterhouse for two not cheap  if i recall but between two it is actually one of the cheaper menu options they carve the steak table side which is a nice touch and it is served with an assortment of complimentary sauces and mustards the flavor of the steak itself was fantastic and exactly what you would expect from dry aged meat the steak had a fantastic crust and flavor from the garnish of thyme butter and garlic the meat was amazingly tender and nearly collapsed with each bite for sides we had the onion rings and broccolini both were delicious and perfect accompaniments for a steak dinner however they obviously were not the most memorable parts of the meal service was truly fantastic here any request or order we had was met almost immediately even our order of onion rings came out a little late maybe   minutes after the rest of our order and they gave it to us on the house overall the meal was pricey but by comparison to other restaurants in singapore and taking into account the quality of the food and service i did not feel overcharged,Positive
cut,my brother warned me into coming to this restaurant he went cut in la before and he said it was an underwhelming experience the steaks were too modern and even a bit pretentious but i still want to try a modern steak house and i have not been to a wolfgang puck restaurant before so curiosity got the best of me the appetizers were alright i have tried the oysters pork belly warm veal tongue and they were all very decent but the steak that i ordered was an extremely huge letdown i have tried and fell in love with snake river farms beef before when i was in the us theoretically what the breeder seek to accomplish is marry that wonderful beefiness of american beef with the luxurious marbling of japanese beef i was ecstatic when i discovered that they were gonna serve that beef in cut singapore even before flying off to singapore i already knew what i was gonna have for my steak my favorite cut of the meat is the rib eye particularly because of that fat decadent layer up top known as the rib cap when my snake river farms rib eye came i was shocked with horror it came without the rib cap i thought i was just unlucky and during my nd visit i ordered the same thing only to face the same nightmare for the second time  the rib eye itself was not that good too it was too dry and too chewy and was a great injustice to a snake river farms beef i do not think i will be back to cut ever again there are many better steak houses in singapore and i would rather go to ruth chris or even morton is instead,Negative
cut,ok i am a ruth is chris and mastros sc plaza bigot when it comes to steaks but i gotta say cut is now in my top  steakhouses first of all the service is fantastic two the drinks are fantastic best dirty martini i have ever had in singapore third my steak and the extra cheesy mac and cheese along with the tuna tartar appetizer were lick the plate clean good i also met some of the nicest people the night i ate at the bar from nyc houston and nj this place is classy so i recommend business casual attire they also had a great selection of wines and i had a spanish red wine cannot remember the name that was fantastic,Positive
cut,came here for a birthday dinner and it definitely lived up to expectations and beyond excellent food service and ambience we got a private table but was able to people watch in the middle of restaurant a simple menus with steak and steak plenty of choices on sauces and sides each staff was perfect in carrying out their services and they were professional to the nth degree dessert must try is the apple crumble the s mores was slightly disappointing otherwise a very perfect dinner as a dinner date or a party,Positive
cut,the food was amazing we loved everything we had there we had salads soups filets and sides and everything was excellent also the bartender loogie made me a mix drink that was out of this world it was literally the best drink i have ever had it was as big as my head had an island of ice that had a live flower on top i am in love,Positive
cut,i have not been to one of wolfgang is cut restaurants here in the states yet but loved going to business dinners at the one in singapore at the marina bay sands it is meatlovers heaven here cool comfortable interiors probably some of the best service in singapore service is not that good there generally but is changing american size portions great cocktails side dishes and the desserts the management is american so they hold to their u s standard on the aged beef the meat trolly is uncommon in singapore so it was nice to see its appearance here you cannot go wrong with cut but warning it is pricey have someone treat you there for maximum enjoyment btw db is mozza and osteria across from it are all also equally great rumor is that thomas keller is coming to singapore soon at marina bay sands btw dress in singapore is one notch down so where here you would be expected to probably have a jacket on and the ladies dressed to the nines in singapore it is much more casual which makes the singapore location an even more casual atmosphere for steak house beginners,Positive
cut,i went back so new review still utterly fantastic and wonderfully enjoyable dessert at the marina bay sands it is understating it to say that this place is now my favorite in singapore and no i have not had their steak and no i am not quite planning to i have an incorrigible sweet tooth and it aches for this behemoth of a chocolate souffle their other desserts are pretty much up there with the best i have had locally but it is the souffle that shines there is some magic in the substantial lightness and all the textures and temperatures in it i could wax lyrical all day and i have done it once before but really just look at it chocolate sauce dribbling down the side while creme fraiche and ice cream sink their slow way into that airy nest of chocolate but you have heard me say all this before so i will try to spare you further expostulation suffice to say that the standard is consistent the chocolate deep and satisfying well worth any gym rat behavior we also managed two other desserts this time a deconstructed banana cream pie of creme brulee chocolate pearls and a caramel banana ice cream and a chocolate hazelnut marjolaine cake with caramel popcorn and salted popcorn ice cream both were pretty good and i especially liked the the chocolate hazelnut slice though i might be biased as a newtella addict though the accompanying popcorn seemed a little staleish small detail though we lapped everything up the place is dark and intimate service friendly and efficient and really the prices are not low but i am more than happy to spend it here for the quality and portions most definitely my favorite place here old review utterly fantastic and wholly incomparable bliss out desserts at this famed steakhouse in marina bay sands i have unashamedly fallen in deep mire with this place it is now my go to for indulging in sweets and i am afraid that it might just become an uncontrollable habit i have wanted to come here for a long time and while i am bursting with adjectives let me objectively say that the souffle was high fluffy barely deflated even after standing and when eaten with the chocolate ice cream and creme fraiche on top was a revelation in deep dark chocolate and that gorgeous play of hot and cold truly this ranks as one of the best mouthfuls i have ever had,Positive
cut,i do not eat steak often mostly because almost all of my beef experiences in singapore have been disappointing i was pleasantly surprised though when i was dragged to cut i got the usda new york sirloin with argentinean chimichurri sauce potato puree and creamed spinach the sides were exactly what i expected no surprises there but archetypes of a high end steak restaurant the steak was what surprised me perfectly medium rare tender with a smoky crispy sear i felt like i was in chicago sure  is not cheap for a oz steak but considering the market it is a good deal i have had some terrible steaks for not a lot less,Negative
cut,only one time and this place has won me over despite being expensive the food and service is great plus nice ambiance makes it an overall enjoyable dinning experience i had the new york sirloin for mains and chocolate souffle for desserts everything was simply cooked to perfection will be back soon,Positive
cut,steak in singapore why not and why not go to cut for that consistency that we come to expect from wolfgang puck restaurant what a brilliant night at cut i had last weekend was traveling solo and had a few meals at local establishments and decided to go visit cut this is my third experience at a cut restaurant las vegas and london being the other two and i could not find one thing wrong everything surpassed my expectations from the excellent seating at the bar to the attention i received from the bartender the cocktail waitress to the gm himself the service was over the top and the food amazing appetizers and i did get a chance to try a few of them the scallops were divine the dirty martini was everything i had heard my best one at a bar the steak had the filet was cooked perfect and would rival any steak you would get in the us the wine pairing was perfect as was the final cap on the experience a singaporean version of baked alaska they had to roll me out of the restaurant but at least i had a big smile on my face lastly i do not normally cast judgement on others but i do find it funny that people constantly comment on how pricey restaurants are if you do your homework and it would not be hard in this case you will know the general price for a meal this place is expensive i reserve going to cut when i am in the mood to splurge and have a great time i actually do not even look at the price as i know it is going to cost a lot is it worth it absolutely is it for anyone no just know that if you are willing to spend it you will have an excellent night out i did and have not regretted one visit to cut,Positive
cut,star food at  star pricessingaporeans are passionate about their steaks it is not uncommon to find  steaks on the menus of many high end restaurants at cut though the prices go significantly higher when you throw in the tempting array of appetisers sides and mains which are done well if you need to justify the bill a hearty dinner for two with wine will reach past  easily when you are mulling over the menu the waiter will trundle over a meat trolley filled with american cuts in white napkins and japanese cuts in black the service is absolutely impressive if you are familiar with morton is you will know what i mean for wagyu lovers and first timers i highly recommend the tasting of new york sirloin it includes kobe style from snake river farm g usda prime corn fed g and japanese wagyu from shiga g as you can guess these are pretty tender and marbled choices so if you prefer something more robust try the angus ribeye or such it is a real meat market here with just about something to suit everyone wolfgang puck pops by to singapore about once a year so do not expect to see the man himself instead he is got a whole crew of stellar managers and chefs from the us to oversee this jumpin joint the music is rather loud but we are told it is the way they like it in the states,Positive
cut,very good steak and ambience is nice a bit dark but modern and stylish dinner is pricey expect to pay about   per person when all is said and done i prefer morton is to cut,Positive
cut,being a vegetarian i will admit that i have only ever been to the lounge area at cut but i feel no shame in reviewing the place despite my clearly incomplete experience because it is just that good what can i tell you about the cocktails here i do not want to recommend a specific one i am sure your tastes differ from mine but i will say that they are all intricately prepared and most of them will blow your mind should i talk about the rough love a combination of gin umeshu and champagne is served in a large wine glass with a giant cube of ice a single raspberry sits atop that ice cube and remains there until you finish your drink the drink looks like an expensive pink diamond ring a delicate balancing act both taste wise and architecturally or should i tell you about the time my hubby asked them to make a penicillin and i sneaked a peek of the bartender pouring domaine de canton in the drink it is not going to be the same i muttered under my breath disgruntled it was not but it was amazing or should i mention that they barrel age some of their cocktails the negroni that i ended up with was softened and rounded off having spent some time in the cask and it tasted timeless i guess i could go on and on the main reason to recommend the lounge at cut is the fact that their bartenders are great artists and they have a great passion for the art of making good cocktails and if you ever do go do not forget to order a portion of the butterscotch apple dessert it is the bomb singapore has many cocktail bars but a few great ones i count the bar at cut and the one at tippling club as the only ones to understand truly what it is like to create a balanced cocktail time and time again,Positive
cut,there was a point in my life when i visited cut monthly because it was soooo good everything from the little cheese poppers in lieu of bread right down to the impeccable service this place is a dream to dine at try the lobsters it is surprisingly delish they also slice up the lobsters with deft orchestrated simultaneous strokes dessert is also a do yum yum yum,Positive
cut,frequented mozza and db bistro but somehow avoided the steak house across because i have never had a good slab of steak here in singapore until i ventured into cut we started with the appetizer of bone marrow flan it was creamy and flavorful and please do share it no one should eat this entire dish alone we also shared the steak tartare which was also fantastic but the serving was good for two so two appetizers for two pax was too much we ordered the us wagyu ribeye and the seasoning texture and doneness were perfect i was blown away i tried the different sauces they provided which were good but i prefer it without any sauces we thought of ordering a side dish but wanted to save space for dessert for dessert we shared the souffle and it was the perfect exclamation point to a delicious dinner,Positive
cut,this was dinner for nye  or is it  either way the food was expensive we knew what we were getting ourselves into marina bay sands and what not suffice to say no one was disappointed despite the cost my manhattan had to have been the best damn manhattan i have ever had the wine list was extensive and at the same time downright ludicrous the lamb with mint sauce was cooked to perfection ahi tartare was executed properly enough i do not know if this is where i would recommend someone to go in singapore for a nice meal but it did the trick they could do without the creepy framed pics of celebrities on the walls we spent several minutes trying to identify katy perry she looks like zooey deschanel and i was thinking marion cotillard,Negative
cut,coming to cut was definitely a good choice when i went to singapore the steak was delicious and perfectly cooked if you want to get steak while your abroad in singapore this is the place,Positive
cut,when in singapore i love the food here i do not question the quality it always tastes fresh and lives up to its expectations the irony is i am not a fan of steak and either is my usual dining mate who is vegetarian so we order salads and on the side dishes in droves and feast in that style for the evening the waitstaff has always been wonderful sometimes we eat at the bar and chat it up with fellow patrons or the bartender great ambiance look forward to coming back again,Positive
cut,i have not been to cut for a proper meal but have been for drinks and dessert located in marina bay sands the restaurant is posh and one of the celebrity restaurants at mbs cocktails here are amazing one of the best places to get cocktails here in singapore its not cheap but they do not skimp on alcohol here at all the concotions are very interesting and sophisticated dessert here is very good as well we tried the chocolate souffl which was amazing a nice place to go for a chill night of drinks,Positive
cut,prices are ridiculous especially for mediocre food that every other restaurant is doing where is the innovation,Positive
cut,expensive but great meat selection n good appetisers too order their pork belly n mac n cheese highly recommended,Positive
cut,great venue too bad it is in a mall albeit a very fancy one the bar has good scene the service is fantastic and the steaks are just the best in singapore hands down pricey but not much more than other steakhouses in the city but unlike other steakhouses here the quality of the meat is fantastic,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,amazing food court but beware if you are not used to asian food and are being experimental touring singapore this may not be the place for you try something like lau pasat instead,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,five star food centre the hardest decision starving myself so i can pack all the delicious offerings and still lament over what else i want to eat disclaimer no air conditioning noisy crowded and expect long lines or queues if you can put aside these dining conditions old airport road is amazing it is a must eat stop for me in sg top of my list seafood soup with minced pork balls yan ji seafood soup this cloudy soup is slowed cooked with layers of flavor there is hint of wokhei fried flat fish ground and added to the minced pork elevates the flavor it is salty and i do not like cooked seafood usually but i cannot got enough of this broth i dream about this soup in the usa i usually get the soup with just the meatballs but everyone else gets fish i hear the prawns are cooked perfectly firm succulent and sweet hint the cheap standard fish they offer is good enough do not be put off the price it is worth it drink lots of water after that  up per bowl rojak or salad with shrimp paste jicama guava cucumber pineapple bean sprouts crispy ew char kuay or fried dough sticks century eggs fermented black eggs buried underground with ammonia mixed with a sweet nutty haekor or shrimp paste that has the consistency of molasses gong gong or boiled sea snails it is an art to eat these delectable bad boys gingerly skewer the flesh beyond the foot slowly ease the flesh until the whole animal is out hold the morsel by the foot dip into sambal belacan or chili paste with fermented shrimp with a generous squeeze of lime hold foot bite and remove foot it is chewy near the foot creamy entrails at the end spicy and delicate gift from the sea  per plate char siu pork and roast pork sioh bak from roast paradise crispy deeply marinated char siu and salty crunchy roast pork belly and crackling served with rice tasty dipping sauce and mustard for condiments ask for more cucumber ice kachang or shaved ice smooth shaved ice drizzled with colored stripes and sweet corn with syrup atop red beans jellies and uptup chee gelatinous sweetened seeds from a palm they are generous i found  yesterday it is better when you share and fight for the uptup chee other delicious desserts are the green jellied nonya chendol shaved iced drizzled with gula melaka palm sugar syrup cheng tng dessert soup with lotus seeds gingko nuts and dried longan there are so many other stalls i wanted to try but i cannot get past my favorites i want to try at least one more dish each time but my stomach fails me if you are still peckish try the epok epok or curry puff with egg char kuay teow or rice noodles with black soy and cockles plump oysters in a half shell s  per oyster,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,i was excited to visit old airport road hawker center specifically for lor mee from the uber popular stall xin mei xiang zheng zong after watching a segment on youtube i braved the long queue and waited over an hour to partake in what i expected to be a bowl of yumminess unfortunately it was a huge disappointment lor mee served with noodles and a generous topping of fish and other ingredients the gravy was significantly rich and thick with a slightly gelatinous texture and predominantly tasted of fish it is definitely an acquired taste not something i would get again despite the rave reviews of lor mee the unsung hero is the minced mixed noodle imo pork dumplings and minced pork swimming in a bowl of wide rice noodles the broth was light and full of flavors with the fresh herbs adding brightness to this delicious dish a must try char kway teow noodles and proteins were impeccably cooked with a beautifully smoky charred flavor however it was well under seasoned and one noted perhaps a dash of soy sauce will help lift the flavors a bit or it was an off day for the stall overall it was not a bad dish fried prawn and pork rolls were a mixed of sweet and savory flavors while it was not my favorite it was a nice side dish curry chicken and black pepper pork puffs had a flaky crispy crusts and loaded with herbs and spices a great snack especially on the go a great tourist destination for food sweets and beverages on the cheap,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,ok maybe i was waiting to be blown away after it was talked up so much but it was just ok good we had some noodles and a clay chicken pot with rice clay pot dish seemed a little dry and over cooked to me maybe we went too late but and it was the bottom of the barrel it did take  min to prepare so it was not just thrown together anyway pretty good and no complaints but i do not think i would make the trek to a hawker market again i would eat passing by experience box checked,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,lots of goodies but goodieslor mie nyonya chendol salt sous vide style hawker stall,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,the hawker food options are limitless here there are so many hawker stalls to choose from and they all look so good i cannot pinpoint any single one but i bet you wo not be disappointed with any of these mom and pop shops it is a little ways out of the main downtown area but can easily be accessed via public transportation,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,old airport road known as the most popular hawker in singapore offers a wide selection of food across different price points depending on what you eat i love eating here but it also makes my indecisiveness a problem haha some of the stalls will sell out and close early to make sure you get to try everything go in a group and go for lunch instead of dinner i have had a few times where i wanted to get roast meats there but they sell out before dinner,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,loved this hawker center tried so many different types of food for so cheap hua kee hougang famous wonton noodles   was definitely a favorite here they nailed the wonton noodle dish the perfect amount of chili sauce dried shrimp and meat to sauce to noodle ratio we also tried hock guan is rojak   which was delicious i only had this once while in singapore so i cannot compare it to other places we ordered some pork satay from chuan kee satay   the flavor was amazing and the pork was tender but it was definitely on the oily side whampoa soya bean is   bean curd with red bean was sensational i wish i buy an entire tub of this and eat it everyday,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,selera rasa if you have not heard of the now   briyani you are missing out used to get this back in my ns days when it was like  and was super stoked to find out the hawker was still around  years later the macik is the best she is super nice and used to remember our faces when we came over for lunch that being said i only remember her being opened till the mid afternoon never saw the place open for dinner but i digress this is hands down one of the best briyanis on the island the rice is fragrant and goes super well with the curry they used the fried chicken and it is little fried scraps are tasty and fresh be sure to ask for veg and the papadum as well she was out of veg when i got there at pm nevertheless always worth the visit selera rasa is located in the corner of old airport road food center the corner being the side closer to the hdb blocks as opposed to the cross street,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,if you come to this food court get the prawn mee at albert street prawn noodle the line can get outrageously long so maybe try getting here before the rush seriously though the prawn mee is amazingly delicious a really unique and complex mix of flavors in one broth also get the or chein oyster omelette at xing li cooked food and if you have a sweet tooth and want something to cool down with away from the heat and humidity nyona chendol is good i like the original but adding red beans looks just as good everything here is cheap relatively speaking old airport road is popular and a bit more touristy but also a little further away from town so if you are a visitor you should just call a taxi mrt is always good but not everyone has the time or patience to check routes and stops if you are a tourist with little to no exposure to singaporean and malaysian food most of the food here will probably seem to be delicious to you more often than not if there is a long line for one particular hawker the food is good but seriously no trip singapore would be complete without visiting a good ole food court,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,as i was doing my research on which hawkers are the best and that i must visit old airport road was one of the highest rated one as you get off the metro station do not get the first food court area confused with the hawker which is right after however the food center opens earlier than the hawker the hawker location had great food selection although this hawker was not my favorite just based on overall atmosphere,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,roast paradise  charsiew with chicken rice  starsnot much meat and the meat has a layer of fat in each slice and is a bit too burnt on the edges which i do not quite like but overall the meat is cooked really well moist juicy meat not too sweet or salty bnr coffeekopi c kosong bing  starsrich good flavor even without sugar would get less ice the next time park at the multistorey carpark the lanes are nice and wide compared to most other hdb carparks,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,praise the lord for hawker centers with so many hawker centers in singapore it is hard to decide which one in my favourite old airport road food centre is definitely a stand out it is highly accessible via multiple bus line with endless options such as prawn noodle wonton noodles fish balls fresh juice curry puffs rojak kopi and kaya toast available this center is where food dreams are form be sure to visit old airport road food centre to eat till your heart is content,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,this is one of the many hawker centers in singapore and compared to some of the other big ones this one is much less touristy our friend who lives in singapore suggested that we meet here for lunch and it was a fantastic adventure we employed the long queue method for determining which stalls to purchase from for a feast of  dishes and  drinks we spent about  total the best item we got by far was the bbq meat i am not sure which stall it was but this one is absolutely worth seeking out happy eating,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,wow i had such an amazing experience here while i was visiting singapore i loved the fresh juices and smoothies along with the chicken rice if you are in singapore you need to check this place out because you wo not be disappointed there are so many different options for food and you will find something tasty for everyone,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,must get the sugar cane juice  very refreshing and affordable drink one of the stall the uncle and aunties will come to your table and ask if you want something to drink they will take your order and then bring it to you that is when you pay them the money we tried to try a lot of the stalls and almost everything that we got is very good we got some recommendation on youtube channels my favorite was the laska p s bring your own napkins,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,my dad and i came here for lunch during our last day in singapore we went to eat at maxwell hawker food centre twice already and decided to come here instead to get here you will need to take the mrt to dakota stop and it is along the circle yellow line this place is pretty huge the first floor are the hawker stalls and the nd floor are mainly shops selling goods stalls that we tried roast paradise stall   they offer roasted pig and char siew dishes our meals costed  sgd each hong hua dessert stall   they offer a variety of shaved iced desserts we shared the ice kachang and it costed   sgd we also got the sugar cane drink but i do not recall what stall it was not bad overall i wanted to try chau kee satay stall   but they only open in the evenings i also wanted to try lao ban soya beancurd stall   again but i was already too full to eat anymore note i tried their tofu dessert at maxwell tho i will come visit again whenever i am in singapore,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,lots of stalls here and plenty of seats i like the dry noodles stall that is on the outside corner of the center and also the fried bananas were yummy here definitely would visit again when in singapore,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,classic hawker center known by locals to be one of sg is best they serve a huge variety of food here with many good selections quite packed and a bit difficult to find seat for a large group but nonetheless a good place to visit to immerse in the true local experiencereviews of some popular stalls i have been to per the below dong ji fried kuay teow the stir fried noodle here has a nice wok smell but the line is long and moves slowly so gotta be patient lao fu zi fried kuay teow another fried kuay teow stall this one has a stronger walk smell than dong ji but i personally prefer dong ji is seasoning of the noodle a very good option nonetheless but super long slow line since they cook one dish at a time wen wen prawn mee average nothing particularly special roast paradise really good bbq pork recommend nam sing hokkien mee usually i am not a big fan of hokkien mee but this one is good the noodle is not too soggy from the gravy and there is a hint of wok smell in the sauce long line chuan kee satay ok despite its popularity i have had better satay elsewhere toa payoh rojak personally not a rojak fan but this is one of the better ones i have had the ingredients were fresh and well balanced if you order with chili it can indeed get spicy hua kee wanton meat good comforting wonton noodles not mindblowing but a safe good bet  soya bean a good place for traditional sg chinese dessert try the tao huey cold tofu pudding sugar cane juice a classic sg refreshment for a hot day,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,i loved the hawker center here my cousin and her fiancee took us here as this was their favorite you can find a seat first and then go to all of the different stands let them know how many ppl are eating they price the portions so you do not have to pay for more than you can eat they bring the food straight to your table number when it is ready even when you pay for beer they bring the bottles to your table too absolutely great food and experience,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,came x and tried xin xiang lor mee    i am not a lor mee fan and has never had a good one i had wanted to try hokkien mee or fried kway teow but both were closed this lor mee had a very long line so i tried it it was very very good worth the wait  good portion came again and had nam seng hokkien mee    it is hard to find a good hokkien mee it is okay and better than many places  small not much wok hei toa payoh rojak is passable sesame paste at another store is average not fragrant sugar cane juice good as always i am happy to have found this place and will try others when i come another year,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,i am so glad that my friend insisted i visit singapore while doing my winter asia tour  it is a pretty popular hawker a term that means chinatown complex where you have two long rows of many different food options fyi it is hard to find napkins there so bring some with you it was also hard for me to find trash bins so i found one attached to a juice stand and threw my trash there i got scolded though since they could get fined for having random trash items in there very odd anywho i ordered some prawn noodles and dessert from two of the stands and left pretty full and satisfied another great eating place to come back for sure and try other stands they also have wifi there so that is a major plus,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,unfortunately i was not able to look at yelp beforehand so i just went with the flow and got random stuff i first got mango jelly ice at some stand that i forgot to take a picture of so i do not know the name it was alright   then i tried roasted chicken rice at xin kee and it was alright as well   then i tried the dragonfruit and mango smoothie at qq juice and that was freaking delicious,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,so many stalls to choose from and unlike other hawker centres this one is not overpriced and not too touristy here is what we got chilly crab pepper crab chicken and rice pork liver mussels and eggsthe chilly crab and the liver were my favorites,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,plenty of stalls here to choose from in fact if you have not make your mind up you will be walking around for at least  minutes deciding what to eat one of the best wonton noodle is located here and there are two stalls which one is better you have to decide there is a minced pork noodle soup and it sells out fast get there after pm the stall will be closed there are at least two prawn noodle stalls here again you have to decide which one is your favourite luckily there is only one rojak stall get a queue number before you start your entree as the queue is super long do not forget the char koay thoew as well as the carrot cake again several better stalls at this hawkers center,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,a solid hawker centre if you are looking for a legit singapore eating experience my current faves include   hua kee hougang famous wan ton meethe  portion of the dumpling noodle fed this hungry preggo lady well i could have shied away from the chilli but i figured it would not do the dish justice if i skipped it the dumplings were stuffed to the brim and delicious throw in the copious amount of al dente noodles in a bowl and it is best   lao fu zi fried kway teowi love char kway teow and am not very particular with my stalls just know this one does the dish justice   waan waanthis is a thai dessert spot that does coconut ice cream their dishes are quite refreshing in this singapore heat however they do try to upsell me sometimes even though i tell them straight up that i am not interested not a fan of that next time i want to try some of the curry puff stalls and the banana fritter stall in the back,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,old airport road fc was my first experience of a hawker center in singapore during my trip in november and it surely did not disappoint my friends brought me here and basically said go and i had absolutely no idea what to get it was so overwhelming since everything looked so damn good and there were new dishes that i was not accustomed to being american and all we ate a variety of delights here from the classic char kway teow to braised intestines i love intestines do not judge i also had my first lao ban dessert here so good we also had oyster omelette the oysters were fat and juicy and the omelette was not overly greasy or anything the only thing i was not too much of a fan of was the hokkien noodles a little bit too ocean tasting for me too bad i could not really tell you which stalls these things came from but i do not think you can go wrong with any of the food here lots of soups noodles desserts and drinks enough to leave you in a food coma for the rest of the night i cannot complain about a place that sells a bazillion types of food only thing i can complain about is that it is not in an air conditioned building haha,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,i know there are many good food stalls here but there are also many mediocre or average food stalls so you do need to know where to go one such average food stall is   which sells congee or rice porridge there are many varieties of porridge available and it does see a steady stream of customer who usually get it to go i like the options available for the century egg pork porridge you could choose meatball or meat slices i think i had the meatball which was lovely it came with a you tiao stick which was still crispy the dish not to order would be the raw fish salad the small portion was miserable one could hardly see the fish slices which were so thin they almost blended in with the disposable plate i guess i am used to the versions served in chinatown food center or even at tekka market food center which were more generous and cheaper too,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,my favourite hawker in singapore in terms of choice although chinatown complex has the craft beer stalls in its favour worth noting there is a covered path all the way there from dakota mrt but not mountbatten i will update the list over time best yi ji vs nam sing fried hokkien mee both are worth trying i personally prefer the fishier sweeter yi ji and its pungent chilli there is something fun about the brusk service as well nam sing is an impressively professional operation and the prawns have a slight edge geylang lor  banana fritters looks unassuming but these are very sweet soft bananas love it i am not a fan of the larger less ripe pisang goreng though lim hin fruits juice the soursop juice classic is phenomenal this stall is supposed to be quite picky with their fruit and it shows good soursop is one of the best things about living here i never thought a simple soursop juice would make my top  meals of  list ok lao fu zi char kway teow black not as much wok hei as i would have imagined from the giant wok perhaps because outside rush hour still this ckt has good ingredients and is on the sweet side cannot wait to try dong ji sin thor bak koot teh a well executed but not standout braised pig leg i am biased due to the closure of the two bkt stalls near my home meaning any bkt finds favour at the moment,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,orchid coffee stall  facing main road sugar cane juicethe owner of the stall is not very pushy but he will approach nearby tables if they want a drink the sugar cane juice here is pretty decent and refreshing   a cup western barbeque supposedly a famous stall and they serve each plate with bun all wrapped up in plastic very old school we ordered chicken pork and lamb all were tender and juicy the sunny side up was perfect too jogurtz a newly opened froyo stall on the back row serves small   or large  cups to be honest both small and large cups seems to have the same amount of froyo just more toppings in the large cup the small sized cup seems to be at least a medium sized llao llao cup it is more icy and slightly more sour than other competitors but it is very refreshing to eat this after alot of bbq and greasy food lao fu zi fried kway teow  probably one of the most famous stalls in old airport road the queue grows quickly but the uncle also cooks quickly the stall can be recognized by the music playing out of the boombox and the auntie who takes orders very quickly you can be the th person down the line and she is asking for your order the kway teow was very wet and was not too oily the flavour was there and i did not eat chunks of lard but i could definitely taste the use of lard xing li cooked food  fried oysteras mentioned by fellow yelper dominic c the fried egg is very gooey and is not crispy the cook definitely takes his own sweet time to cook the fried egg jia long mei shi chicken wingsthe chicken wings were juicy and good the auntie was very friendly and there was no queue got the food quickly and ate it quickly as well not a bad choice for chicken wings kah ping ri ye xiang rojaklots of big dough fritter pieces all were crispy despite taking my time to slowly finish up the plate the chilli can be quite spicy so beware lots of crushed peanut in every mouthful ming kee fuzhou fish balls  facing main road fuzhou fish balls have meat embedded in the fish ball which is nice the meatballs are soft and bouncy and very flavourful the soup is slightly more bland and comes with a small seaweed they are served in portions of,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,singapore hawker food or street food as the west called them over hundreds of stalls selling local food fla ours must try when in singapore certain stalls have lines stretching  men deep take note there is no air conditioning in the building,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,many good foods and is very crowded tried lor mee but is quite normal and over hyped toa payoh rojak is good now is not so crowded kueh chap is delicious fried prawn noodle is good fried kway lau foo che is a bit dry paste cheap and good beer is cheap bbq pork is delicious satay good,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,my first hawker is center turned out to be my favorite and one of the highlights of my asia trip great food and good layout highlights chay kway teow mixed type of noodles in a soy like sauce was a hit  stars hor fun wide rice noodles with gravy  stars carrot cake rice patties with egg and a brown sauce was one of my faves  stars meatball bao soft bun and tasty big meatball hiding inside   stars black pepper puff did not care that much about the famous curry puff but loved the black pepper version inside of the thick flaky exterior   stars fresh juices so good i got  blend the fruit with a bit of ice right there  stars tofu silky and just a bit sweet of a dessert meant to eat a few spoonfuls but almost ate the whole container   stars noodles with minced meat with and without soup with linguine type noodles were great  stars layout  long aisles with seating in between and outside under umbrellas lowlights few stalls closed on sunday need coins to pay last for the toilet my friend wanted fresh fruit for his kid but could not find it anywhere got my  week trip off to an awesome start blissfully happy trying all of these dishes and would love to come back again,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,this hawker center is a bit out of the way but worth the stop if you have time after visiting a couple of other hawker centers this one was your typical place of various food stalls and such do note that if you need to go to the restroom it will cost you ten cents to do so for most of the food here the options vary from porridge to pasta to the typical dishes you see at hawker centers i did not know what to get so i conducted a small experiment instead of ordering whatever looks good to me i simply chatted with some of the locals and ordered food based on their recommendations result everything i got was delicious one of my favorite items was the thai style noodle dish with wonton soup the stall was located in a dark ish looking corner of the place the wonton soup yummylicious the broth was perfectly seasoned and the wontons itself were savory and filling for only  you get both the wonton soup the noodles noodle dish was quite tasty with the fresh cut bbq pork and the seasonings on the dish was not too overwhelming for other small dishes i tried i really enjoyed the curry flavored puff and the fried dumpling for the puff the outside was nice and flaky while the inside tasted legitimately like good thai yellow curry with its potatoes and chicken as for the fried dumpling this was surprisingly filling the inside was mostly chicken potatoes and small veggies and it had a nice spicy kick to it overall i really like the vibe of this place you do not see too many tourists and the locals are friendly and nice to talk to not sure if it was the time we went late afternoon but there was hardly a long wait except for one stall in particular for most of the food stalls definitely a relaxing eating experience at this hawker center,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,had the lor mee  and fried kway teow  which also both had long queues the lor mee was excellent and much better than it looked but the kway teow  portion was only ok and the portions were tiny you can add cilantro and chilis and black vinegar to the lor mee which i highly recommend,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,a great friend from thailand came for a visit and we decided to go for a good simple meal at this food center there is incredible variety of food but i am going to give a review specifically of wen wen pork rib prawn mee stall   we had a steamboat of crab prawns clams pork ribs intestines and pig tails the base stock was crazy good with intense flavors of prawn and pork after the ingredients were eaten the stock became extra rich with even more intense flavors this time with crab and clams into the mix the owner is richard a thoroughly nice guy the place and ambience is well hawker center but here you can also bring your own stuff vegetables abalone or whatever and just throw into the pot richard wo not charge you extra highly recommended and very affordable one hint better come before october  as he will move to kallang market,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,we ate here after hearing many great stories of the local food stalls within the hallowed portals of the old airport road food centre we were on the hunt for my new local favorite singapore dish char kway teow and settled on unit   the stall was named lucky and their specialty was spelled differently as char kuay tiao minor details aside we ordered two plates of char kway teow with chili the drink stall across the crowded way crammed with tables and people was playing classic rock and had carlsberg on special offer we also ordered a couple of drinks from the juice stall beside our lucky stall the food was great great flavor of cockles chinese chives bean sprouts and flat noodles all cooked in light and dark soy sauce just the right amount of spiciness and a good sized portion what is not to love washed down with carlsberg and soursop and plum juice listening to old aerosmith and acdc our visit was a resounding success cannot wait to go back,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,one of my favourite hawker centres do try lao fu zi char kueh teow worth the long line lao ban dou huachee cheong funsliced fish bee hoonlor meeat night the satay zi char hokkien mee rojak stall are all pretty decent i must say old airport road is one of those hawker centres with the most stalls selling pretty decent local delicacies,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,i came here first time today it seems many good eating shops are there but i tried my most favorite food in singapore fried hokken prawn mee very good,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,this food centre seems a bit out of the way which is good because it was not too crowded on a friday afternoon but bad because i need that crowd to know where to go i feel so helpless if there are no lines of any sort to help me make the very important decision about what to eat i settled on some curry chicken and bread which was good plenty of seating both inside and out,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,i liked this place better than the other hawker spots the noodles were tasty pic posted as were the toast and dragon fruit juice yummm we got the noodles since it had the longest line there hehe sometimes following the crowd has its perks,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,old airport just open hock lam beef noodles different from the actual well known same name beef noodles not so herbal and they include kiam chai and peanuts soup is not so salty compare to org hock lam it is new and not so many people and the old man is original,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,it is a better hawker centre in the day than at night most of the more popular stalls are actually closed at night as in most hawker centers in singapore you bring with you some patience and join any stall that has a line that will be your best bet my personal favorites nan xing hokkien fried noodles because they do the version that i prefer that has more bee hoon than yellow noodles peanut pancake kway chap carrot cake oyster omelette stall facing the front entrance,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,went there at   am on a sunday hoping to skip the lunch crowd but it is already bustling with lots of people there is a  hour wait for the famous fried hokkien mee and so we went around looking for other alternatives instead guess it is the hot weather and the packed crowd the porridge stall holder we went to that also make hand made chee cheong fun with filling is super grumpy she even shouted at her mom who do the finishing touches before handing the food to the customers end of the trip i have decided not to visit this place again sadly it is not a place that i want to go and feel good,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,there are so many great food stalls in this hawker my favorite would be the lao ban the fried kway teow the claypot chicken rice and the little stall that does popiah but no matter what local craving you have this is the place to go to satisfy it,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,best food court i have tried so far the wanton stall had an awesome pork and shrimp dumpling soup also had their spicy noodle on the side which was perfect the tried a lime juice fresh from the cold drink stall also amazing totally refreshing and not too sour tart lastly grabbed a hot red paste bun from the only place selling hot buns in there which was so fluffy and perfectly hot and topped with sesame seeds white and black i will definitely be back all for the low low price of   for all of the above,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,it is a huge hawker center prices are reasonable and there is a lot of choice including novelty stalls such as western meat grill cupcakes my favorite by far though is the thai stall in the inner row which makes a killer green curry do not miss it,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,my favourite hawker centre when in singapore i am in hole in the wall heaven with all of the amazing inexpensive hawker centres this one is at the top of my list on every visit over the years some of my best meals in singapore have been here highlights are one of the absolute best black pepper crabs i have had in my life a wonderful char keow teow that had that lovely wok hei as well as some of the most flavourful chinese sausage i have had wonderful laksa and a smooth fresh tofu that i can still taste i passed on the crocodile foot soup that i saw on a past visit and did not see it again after that darn,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,i used to come here a lot when i was in secondary school so this place brings back lots of memories seems like everyone is raving about the ckt so here is my take on two of them let me start with lucky char kway teow according to the owner the stall has been in operation for seven years and they have various recommendations as seen plastered around the stallfront the ckt here is less than saucy i e dry in a good way i like that the lupcheong chinese sausages were given in ample amounts and the taste was strong and distinct from the rest of the noodles the noodles were pleasant and would give it a    stars opposite lucky on the second last row of stalls on the west side of the hawker center is laofuzi ckt with a green sign there is always a queue regardless of the time of the day and many have sworn by this ckt i find would not drive like hours to just eat this its just okay the noodles are quite delicious when eaten hot and the hum cockle just rounds off the taste i love hums no trip to oarfc is complete without laoban soya bean there is  a competitor and much cheaper but the taste at laoban is just superior it has a strong bean taste that some may call plasticky but i really like it choose the small cup  of soy bean milk for a filling and wholesome thirst quencher,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,ahhh the hawker centre with the hokkien mee stall that is more elusive than a french laundry table it is called nam sing and it is store number   and you must call him first at    before coming if the uncle does not pick up the phone do not bother coming if he picks up the phone make sure you ask if there are still a lot of noodles left i had the unfortunate experience when i made sure that they were open but they were sold out by the time i got there other than nam sing there are several other famous stalls here such as xin mei xiang lor mee lao fu zi kway teow toa payoh rojak lao ban soya beancurdetc etcbut for me i always go for the hokkien mee imo the best in singapore where the noodles is very eggy and it is cooked like an al dente pasta,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,a must go when visiting singapore i absolutely loved the vibe of the place which is where you can go to see how the locals eat food is so inexpensive at   usd a plate lines stretch over half an hour for the most popular stalls at peak times definitely try the famous hougang mee noodles the hougang otah fatman satay only evenings fish soup char kway teow and fried oyster omelette stalls many of the stalls at this food center have been opened for over  years although few retain their original owners to this date the food is still super tasty also the crazy line at the back of the food center is probably for lao ban bean curd dessert and soy drinks i have seen more than  people lining up and their product is really different than other local versions this one has an almond taste to it and a very custard texture which is unlike the soy milk quality that their competitors produce beat the crowd by going at am or pm before the locals come eat payment is always in cash and local currency so leave your credit cards at home,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,fairly standard hawker center with a big selection of more chinese and singapore type flavors i wish there were a few indian options but what is here is pretty good good fish ball soup seafood salad prawns and other seafood choices not many beer choices either make sure to bring your tissues to hold a table as it gets fairly crowded at meal times,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,my favourite hawker centre of all time why does anybody go to newton this is the shit there is everything here including great kway chap blanco court char kway teow lao fu zi lor mee xin mei xiang and hokkien mee nam sing also the now famous lao ban beancurd with its equally crazy queues the only downside about eating at a food centre like this with so many all stars i cannot think of any other food centre where you have to queue so much no matter what you are ordering on the bright side even if you did not want to queue for the famous stalls the less famous stalls which offer the same types of food tend to be quite good too nothing really sucks i think not sure if that is a safe proclamation to make my new favourite stall here is the under rated chuan loo bee hokkien stall which is opposite the lao ban beancurd stall it sells some of the best and cheapest seafood and zichar i have ever seen i love the black pepper crabs hotplate egg omelette and beancurd and pretty much everything they have got wash down the huge feast any combination of things here put together necessarily constitutes a feast with a beer or sugar cane juice and mark it down as the quintessential singapore experience do your tourist friends a favour and take them here not newton,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,oh the sinful memories i used to work very near old airport road and had lunch there almost everyday i believe this should be stated as a major job perk if my office was hiring the place is divided into  rows my colleagues and i always call it row  facing the road  or  against the wall to differentiate the stalls there is a wonderfully juicy chicken chop at row  the chicken is succulent and never fails to emerge with glistering skin and an intoxicating grilled aroma on the same row there is a small stall that sells goreng pisang and fried nian gao aka rice cake and fried get this durian it is amazing in row  there are two battling stalls of wanton mee apparently each stall has their own loyal following can tell from the queue the thing about hawker food is that everything is so affordable every meal there can easily spiral out of control and become a little feast not that i am complaining,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,absolutely adore this place all my favourite foods in a hawker centre space just slightly larger than maxwell market packed with the famous hougang wan ton mee lao ban tau huey delicious traditional chinese desserts like the pastes chng tng gingko barley soup bak kut teh tze char lor mee chicken rice pig organ soup not my cup of tea but fans love the ones here complete with fruit juice drink vendors thrown in and the occasional duplicate bandwagon stores which are totally legit and yummy as well easy to get to dakota mountbatten mrt  minute bus ride from the city envious of people who live in the vicinity and get to have all these local delicacies in their disposal till late in the night,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,lots of good eats within one place i would always heard about the wonders of old airport rd hawker centre but never traipsed over east ish it is actually not that far east even to try it out but since a colleague from abroad was here visiting we made the pilgrimage down  lao fu zi fried kway teow   nd row of stalls kind of in the middle is certainly da bomb deliciousness  for a plate not an overwhelming lot but probably enough saturated fats to last for a while unfortunately noodles were well fried and slid down your throat with a suitable amount of sweetness from the sweet black soy this stall has a combination of kway teow noodles the flat rice noodles and thick round yellow noodle i cannot figure out the name unfortunately this website calls it which is not found everywhere my two female colleagues baulked when they saw me approaching the table with  plates of  noodles this as recommended by an uncle standing in line in front of me when i asked for a  plate he convinced me that   plates was more worth it i guess it is true did not make the lady boss any happier certainly however the six of us devoured almost all of it  mattar seafood barbecue   rd row of stalls right at the back a chilli crab was not bad colleagues liked it a lot and preferred it to jumbo is it is also cheaper at  kg we got  for  not too bad i guess and yay for mantous cents each although still cannot beat the forture seafood ones those are gigantic and fluffy and heaven on earth b stir fried greens with mushrooms  was also pretty good we just asked for whatever green veg they had and she supplied us with puay leng chinese spinach with mushrooms with a delicate light sauce c sambal stingray  from them was unfortunately so so the stingray was okay but the sambal was somewhat lacklustre pity about that  guan kee seafood   a cereal prawns  i think were delicious i forget how many prawns they gave us though b pork ribs king  was not that great tender pieces but not much flavour,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,old airport road food centre is where i bring my friends from overseas for a taste of local food with a wide variety of stalls all housed under one roof this place is home of my favourite hokkien mee wan ton mee and hand made cheong fun there is also the hugely popular lao ban tau huay alongside many traditional dessert stalls the hokkien mee in the rd row cannot remember what it is called exactly is absolutely divine however the wait for it can go up to   hours during busy periods it gets pretty crowded on weekends and finding a table and parking can be pretty difficult so planning for an early dinner lunch may help you avoid some of the crowd,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,this place has an insane amount of choices i am completely lost everytime i am here at least count there must be at least  stalls selling the same food char kway teow wanton noodles western etc i do not come here enough even though my school used to be near some picks satay vermicelli you do not get this very often around anymore wanton noodles fried kway teow do not bother queuing go for the ones without  beancurd and round off with a glass of sugarcane juice my colleagues pick the cantonese porridge and western food stall i am only ranking this a ok because i think i need to explore this place more before i make my decision,Negative
old-airport-road-food-centre,old airport road food centre is the place to go for cheap and good food under  roof the huge compound holds more than a hundred stalls ranging from savory to sweet small snacks to hearty meals local to western cuisine some hot favorites are the  competing wanton mee stores at the left end of the complex cho kee and another stall they even have their electronic queue display there is a hand made chee cheong fun stall i am not sure what is its name it is in the second block the second row from the main road there is always a long queue for this one melt in your mouth rice rolls with char siew or prawns or scallops and topped with a light soy and shallots yums other great stuff includes lor mee lao ban beancurd albert street prawn mee and more char kway teow is apparently very popular too,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,mention old airport road and everybody will know that you are referring to the legendary hawker food centre near katong which has probably one of the highest concentration of good local food it is also very huge spanning  rows of stalls in a space that is probably the size of a football field or bigger seating will be a challenge most times especially on weekends however this is when group work comes in one can sit the others can start to queue to buy the food of course the famous lao ban beancurd will come to mind since they originated here however there are also other notable stalls such as lao fu zi fried kway teow and whitley road big prawn noodles the tpy rojak and hokee wanton noodles are also very good the western bbq stall also has great chicken chops if you are unsure of what to eat just join the stall with a queue and you cannot be wrong,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,old airport road is probably the coolest hawker centre i have been to in singapore if you are looking to do it right go for dinner eat as little as possible beforehand i know near impossible if you are visiting singapore and buy as many things as possible here if you are a tourist it is about a  minute walk from the mrt,Positive
old-airport-road-food-centre,another amazing food center with so much to try and share char keow teow was a highlight here also the rojak is a must,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,another cheap michelin star restaurant selling the famous bak kut teh which means pork ribs tea it is just white pepper broth with a hint of vinegar even though they claim it has none they have  locations throughout sg and all are make the same broth after a few spoonfuls it gets very addicting the pork melts in your mouth and the servers come around refilling the broth for free also ordered ngoh hiang like a soft bean curd minced pork roll and was delicious too cheap food i believe it was usd for  items for sure will be back,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i was not convinced that this place warranted the reviews when i saw a couple patsy white ribs in some clear ish broth how could anything be delicious when it looked boiled with no seasonings nope nope nope i stand corrected i can admit i was very wrong the meat was unlike any other ribs i have ever had and the broth is just an extra bonus how something so unassuming and simple can be so good i can not pretend to even know but my socks were completely knocked off can soup make a grown woman cry yes yes it can the ambiance and service is simple the price is low and the product is amazing will i fly back to singapore for ribs in soup i just might,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i walked across the streets nearly swam over the oceans to arrive here just kidding it was pouring so hard outside even though i brought my umbrella with me my shoes and socks were soaking wet we ordered the pork ribs soup  homemade ngoh hiang and oolong tea pork ribs soup was amazing the flavour was still dancing in my tastebuds even after i had swallowed my spoonful of soup waitress walking around with a pot of soup to refill for the customers i had three refills already the pork ribs were soooo tender homemade ngoh hiang tasted crispy on the outside and the inside was stuffed with pork meat one had to dip the pork ribs in sweet and sour sauce to enrich the taste last but not the least i was given a pot and a bag of tea leaves to make my own oolong tea it was such a good experience there are still a lot of dishes i wanted to try but i am already full hope that they will open a restaurant in canada,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,tender pork that falls off the bone a rich pepper essence soup broth that warms the soul couple these two goats together and you have a recipe for the ages i do not even think it is necessary to add more detail here because the goat needs no introduction no explanation no approval the pork rib pepper soup here at song fa bak kut teh really is the goat tiger woods michael jordan of soups all hail and long live the goat in song fa bak kut teh we trust,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,bak kut teh is a garlicky peppery flavorful pork soup that is a must try when in singapore it is delicious mixed with rice there are so many bak kut teh restaurants in singapore but song fa was so good that we came back a second time during our short  days trip we even got bak kut teh spice packets so we can make it at home we tried making it and it is pretty similar to the real thing when you follow their directions correctly and the soup has essentially unlimited refills they come around asking you if you want more soup and we refilled our bowl  times their tea is very strong and aromatic and also available to buy in packets to brew at home,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i was in singapore on a food hunting trip and i could not pass on some bak kut teh it is one of my favourite things to eat i arrived at a fairly late hour after pm i have heard there is typically a lineup but being a solo diner at less than peak hours i got seated right away the place looks clean and bright and people around me seem to be having a great time the service as i recall was really good i ordered the staple prime spare ribs soup which comes with a bowl of rice a plate of gai lan and the server suggested lemon barley water which is made in house the total bill came out to be around  sgd the main event was amazing i loved the white pepper flavour of the broth and it warmed me up to my tippy toes good thing they have ac i did expect a bit more pork flavour but it was really good nonetheless by the way did i mention the broth is bottomless the server came by at least   times to ask if i wanted a refill it was so good it was hard to refuse but at the end i was just too stuffed to have anymore the lemon barley tea was fantastic also and hit the spot to alternate between the hot broth and the cold drink the gai lan was on point and very generous for the  sgd price tag overall i had a very satisfying time and i would definitely go back again given the chance to try more things hopefully next time i can go with more people to try more things on the menu,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,one of my favorite meals in singapore out in la even though we have all types of food available it is always hard to find a place that serves bkt  and of its on the menu it is not as good as this place such a simple dish of broth and pork ribs with rice also had the pork kidney and stomach soup as well both just as good broth is more peppery for the stomach soup in case those who are allergic or do not like pepper the kidney does have a little blood when it comes out not over cooking if you are skirmish on the red might want to pass side veggies were decent more to add green in the table not a must they will refill your soup so get a big bowl of rice going they have a good drinks menu but opted for the kung fu tea the royal garden is the one they sell you do have to make and prepare it yourself at the table that is real tea service after the meal you can also grab a couple boxes to make at home which i did but will update my results on how it turns out they have multiple locations but this one is located inside a shopping center near chinatown i visited one other location closer to marina bay and downtown but does not have ac this type of humidity and heat not the best place to be consuming broth,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,not sure why i ended up in chinatown but there i was and i was absolutely starving song fa to the rescue had to wait a bit for the table but was able to put the order in before seating to quicken the turn works for me the pork rib soup here never disappoints the flavor and heat on the broth was so good that i refilled probably  times or so yes there is unlimited refill the fish soup was loaded to the top with plenty of fish and also had the same soup base as the pork i was initially a bit thrown off because i was honestly expecting a fish based broth it still worked since i like the pork broth anyway but i will probably just stick with the pork rib soup next time bean curd was surprising good i will probably get that again have been very tempted to pick up some of the soup base that they sell not sure how much it will resemble the in store version if i am the one cooking it,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,came by when we were in chinatown there was a line but our wait was only about  minutes staff will take your order while in line to speed up food delivery once you do get a table ordered their signature pork ribs soup braised pork belly braised fried beancurd ngoh hiang and assorted vegetables broth for the soup appeared very simple but had such a nice taste and they refill the broth for free pork belly and ngoh hiang kind of sausage were very tasty some in our group thought the pork belly had too much fat service was good and they give you a moist towelette,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,solid   for song fa bkt bak kut teh is an aromatic pork rib pepper soup that is so good i would not mind eating in the hot muggy hawker centers of singapore if i recall correctly this location of song fa has air con but do not hold me to that when you order the soup they will come around and refill your broth as many times as you need the meat is tender and delicious you can also purchase soup packets to make your own bkt at home there will likely be a wait but the line moves pretty quickly and you can always pop by the mc donalds if you need a snack,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,highly recommend the loin rib soup even though the weather was hot and humid we came here after a long walk from marina bay and gardens by the bay at night the place was packed but did not have to wait for a table quick tip get the small as there is unlimited refill of soup unless you want an extra rib we did not even start eating yet and they already started coming by to refill your soup they rec to move the rib to the empty bowl so you can fill up with more soup,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,despite not being hungry since we had eaten at  other places already that morning we found ourselves wanting to try song fa bkt before heading to the airport and leaving singapore this location was the closest to us and we arrived around pm not realizing that there would be a wait luckily the wait was only around  minutes and the food came out quickly everyone was having some version of the famous fall of the bone rib soup it was hearty and delicious the clear soup was flavorful from the hours of cooking that said i think the rib soup i make at home is almost at good and i am no genius in the kitchen,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this little restaurant is usually filled to the brim with people but today we had a little space to enjoy our lunch come early and be ready to sit wherever you can find a spot the soup and pork ribs are amazing here they come out with little tea kettles with the soup so that you can have more with your meal if you like the soup you can even buy packets to make it at home with the seasonings they provide the pork itself is soft and extremely flavorful from the seasoning it is not your traditional ribs you would see in other restaurants that are filled with sauce or other flavorings it is a light flavor that enhances the flavor of the pork itself you can almost say it melts in your mouth and definitely falls off the bone they also serve a variety of food like pork belly feet liver and veggies all items were delicious i would go back without any question,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,we were in singapore for  days and passed by this restaurant a dozen time boy do we regret it we came here after we had dinner elsewhere so our bellies were quite content we came in for the famous pork soup and paired it with a bowl of rice and vegetables the flavor notes of the soup is incredibly rich and intense we were both shell shocked we also arrived right before closing which the restaurant happily accommodated they even gave us additional servings of soup for free not sure if this is a free gesture anyway whether you are looking for a place to eat a full meal or a snack this is a must try,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,can get the server to understand had to point he still did not get it right ordered large pork soup supposed to get  bones i got  skinny bones and a stub hidden under server said that was  bones i blew my top and walked out,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,we had a  hour layover in singapore and we were hunting for the best places to eat this happened to definitely take top  we stopped by looking for some soup the line was long but it moved pretty fast our party of  got seated within  minutes around lunch time on a week day we stayed simple and ordered the large rib soup with rice and a side of veggies as simple as the rib soup was it was delicious it was so flavorful yet so simple my husband and i both found so much joy in slurping our soup the soup comes with unlimited refills but the meat does not we got about  refills of soup haha this place also feels very homey and i felt that they used quality ingredients because you could taste the flavor of the ribs really well and they were incredibly tender,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i absolutely love this place for bak kuh teh pork ribs soup the soup is flavorful and delicious the meat is quite good and you also can ask for unlimited refills of soup i also would definitely recommend ordering the  to dip in the soup they taste amazing together i also personally prefer the prime spare rib soup over the standard pork ribs soup i find the texture to be better and the meat is much easier to eat as well note that there can be a wait at times i have been here a couple times for weekday dinners and usually have to wait about   minutes there are actually  queues as well one outside and one inside the outside one tends to be shorter but has no a c so take your pick the prices here are also quite reasonable the standard pork rips soup is s   for regular or s   for the large you only get more meat with the large and i think the soup is the best part so i would go for the regular the prime spare rib soup is s,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,having traveled   km and the memories from song fa bak kut teh are still with me the aroma and the flavor from the pork rib soup are very distinct as the garlic smacks your taste buds at first i was quite taken aback then i tried it again the flavor was just as intense and rich that you can only sip a little bit at a time as i try the other dish pork belly and pork loin which just melts in your mouth it was pure deliciousness however you always find yourself coming back to the pork rib soup the best part is when you are almost done with the pork soup they come and pour some more that is just magical this restaurant is a must for anybody visiting,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,bak kut teh translates from hokkien to mean pork rib tea it is actually pork ribs soup served with a variety of side dishes the accompanying tea you can brew on your own song fa is one of the famous local places i have grown up eating tender meat comes with free flowing soup that has just the right amount of kick from the peppercorns the kidney and liver were also done just right,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,this is the place to go for bak kut teh according to my singaporean friend i can see why the soup base is a symphony of garlic and pepper a loud symphony like tchaikovsky is  overture but a masterpiece nevertheless i tried bak kut te elsewhere since but it just is not the same we arrived at the restaurant before opening and there was already a line,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,googled this place while visiting sg when my grandparents wanted to drink some pork rib soup found this highly reviewed place so decided to head on over place was packed at  in the afternoon luckily we got in right before the line started to form outside it was my first try at this and the soup ribs and sides were all really good the ribs were fall off the bone soft and the soup was very tasty and flavorful the only thing was service was not attentive and had to keep getting their attention for everything they do refill your soup   times for free after you are done which is awesome i would recommend this place if you want to get some pork rib soup i am glad i tried this and now i am hooked,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,my bf suggested i try bak kut teh when i go to singapore and after trying a relatively flavorless one in a different mall i stumbled upon this chain after reading about it earlier that morning without hesitation i walked in to try he also wanted the powder packets and man it was a great decision i ordered a pork tenderloin soup and though it did not have heaping chunks of garlic it was delicious and so much more flavorful than the other bowl i had i really could have drank the soup forever even if it was yet another hot day in singapore there were a lot of people inside but overall it was not a long wait i also ordered while in line which made it quick and efficient,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,after reading my previous review jumbo seafood you might ask so what is the second must try food when in singapore the answer is bak kut teh from song fa  locations in singapore the literal translation of bak kut teh is meat bone tea it is more generally and accurately translated as pork rib soup the story was that back in  the founder of the chain sold this delicious soup made with pork ribs and a secret blend of spices in a push cart stall at the time he could not even afford a refrigerator and he had to store his ribs in the freezer from a friend is liquor store today song fa is a household name in singapore and the lines of each of its seven stores are always out the door into the streets and sometimes wrapped around the block but they were also very efficient a server took our order while we were still standing in line and gave us a ticket from his ipad once we were seated our order arrived at our table very promptly the peppery broth was made with pork ribs a blend of secret spices and lots of white pepper the white pepper gave a distinct and strong flavor to the broth that was stimulating to the palate the rib meat which has soaked in the richness of the broth fell off the bone effortlessly and was melt in your mouth tender after you finish your ribs when there is more room in the bowl you can ask for a refill of the soup they will happily do that in fact i saw some people ask for two or more refills while they probably wo not tell you their secret recipe they do sell boxes of pre mixed packets of the spices at the cashier is counter yours truly actually bought a box of  packets each of which is good for   servings i am actually making the soup right now i will let you know how it goes when i see you next time,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,definitely stop by any of the song fa bkts while you are in sg there are many locations and there is normally a wait so try to go during off peak times however the lines moves pretty quickly too the broth here is excellent you can buy a ten pack of their spice packets to make at home for  sgd which is equal or cheaper than going to the market you can ask for refills on the broth at all their locations the meat is extremely tender and they often run out of the tender pork bone soup which is really just baby back pork ribs instead of regular pork ribs traditionally people get the pickled mustard greens to eat with it as well as maybe some rice the chinese donut yeow taow goes well as a crouton in the soup the bkt here is excellent and this is the bkt you must try in sg,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,stumbled across this place googling good places to eat near chinatown point in singapore this place looked like it had great reviews so i though i would give this a try to be honest i do not even like most soups or pork ribs but i wanted to try something new and was hoping this place would change my mind and oh it did i had dinner early so i missed the dinner rush lineup and was seated right away they gave me a stool for my belongings and a cloth to cover them i ordered the small bowl of pork ribs soup with rice and water the dish arrived literally immediately after i ordered the meat was fall of the bones tender and the soup was a delightful mix of spices and it was so delicious it was nothing i could put words to the soup was refillable too and the waiters were constantly coming by to refill the soup i seriously want to know what went into that soup but will likely never find out i wish i could be back but i am halfway across the globe now and still craving this so if you happen to be in singapore give this a try,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,there is usually a queue here for a reason classic singaporean peppery bak kut teh pork bone soup with free soup refills in contrast to the malaysian herbal type get there earlier before pm or the premium pork loin may be sold out so tender and fall off the bone there is two shops in this location one at the corner and another a couple shops down so do not be confused make sure you arrange to meet at the same place there is no big difference between the two except one has air conditioning and one does not cannot go wrong with either,Negative
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,bak kut teh is classic homey singaporean food and this place does it so well love the free refills of soup when your bowl runs low besides the bak kut teh their veggies are good too and so are the ngoh hiang my favorite location is the original one on new bridge road but every outlet has similar quality food and so it is really just the ambiance that is different they also sell packets of the spices so you can make it at home great souvenirs for foodie friends if visiting from overseas,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,awesome it is surprising for refillable soup never heard of in asia prices is really affordable always a line there but it is worth it,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,super good with free refill in broth reminiscent of my childhood dish made by grandma charge  cents per napkintakes credit card tooac since located in mall,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,song fa is a chain in singapore they are well known for the bak kut teh pork rib soup it may not look super flavorful but it was pretty tasty and all about the broth the broth is especially pepper y do not forget you can get unlimited broth as well sides were delicious pork belly is always delicious kai lan vegetables are fresh and the bean curd is good as well lines may look a little long but they go quickly,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,one of if not the most popular chains of bak kut teh in singapore for me its a very safe option for tasty food and there is always a long line waiting regardless of the branch unlike the malaysian version which has a stronger herbal taste the bak kut teh here is mainly seasoned with white pepper and garlic which leads to a very easy to drink comforting bowl of ribs and soup i cannot say which one i prefer as i crave them at different times do not forget to order a side of you tiao cut up chunks of fried dough and a side of rice to accompany your meal you can ask them to top off your soup anytime the other side dishes are less memorable but not bad i definitely go with only the bak khut teh in mind,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,i am actually a bigger fan of the herbal kind of bkt teh but once in awhile the peppery version will do just fine i gave it stars instead of my bias star rating still leaning towards herbal as the soup was flavourful the kidneys were nicely cooked and sliced not too thin and not too thick with a cool looking criss cross pattern on it the pork rib i got managed to slip off it is bone without much assistance service was prompt and friendly even though it was crowded as with the mandatory refill of soup with a smile  of the staff even greeted me goodbye after paying and walking out of the stall  thumbs up for that given that they are a franchise i am impressed by the service and consistent quality they provided at this outlet   stars,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,loved this tiny restaurant just missed the long line for lunch get here early the pork rib soup and mouth watering rice were exactly what we were looking for a definite must in singapore order was taken in line food arrived within minutes after sitting down,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,oh the broth i would come everyday just for the broth of their star dish simple but excellent products for a true singaporean experience,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,bak kurt teh soup oh so good with unli refills and take it with rice side dish spinach was ok this outlet had ac so no complaint here staff ready for service requests queue can be testing your patience our party wait was min,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,the location is very convenient the waiters are very attentive and friendly the soup is tasty and they refill it as well,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,heard about this place from my facebook friend as long as i can remember so when i actually went out on my vacation this place was in my radar stumbled upon this place while i get off the chinatown mrt and just have to queue up for it  mins wait they said got sat in  mins a plus they take my order while i am queuing and when i sat walah food is here very efficient and fast although one of the server terrence forgot to put in my extra order of pork belly i wont hold him to it its busy so anyway our family got their stomach full and absolutely great place to eat,Positive
song-fa-bak-kut-teh,the bak kut teh bkt was quite good the soup was peppery instead of herbal which was what i had previously from a different location in singapore the regular bkt tasted better than the premium the pork stomach was good the deep fried prawn roll was just so so aircon dining area was great service was very good we arrived early for dinner and wait time was no more than  min yes i would come back again,Positive
ippudo,closest you will find in singapore to good authentic japanese ramen broth is amazing and seriously worth the price,Positive
ippudo,third time a charmi have dined at ippudo first in new york and second in hong kong singapore is my favorite like any good restaurant in sg there is wait line for a table early before opening or later after   p m there is a lesser wait time the hakata ramen and well seasoned pork broth is savory perfection the interior is smartly decorated with a dominate crystal chandelier as its center piece service is quick and disciplined to a perfection waitstaff are incredibly efficient in turning tables located mandarin gallery closest mrt station somerset ns,Positive
ippudo,came here on a recommendation ramen was outstanding but the real players were the pork buns and the steak very freaking delicious the french fries tastes american which i was hoping for murica,Negative
ippudo,famous for its ramen have not been here for a long time no queue at   p m on a saturday but it was full by about  p m shiromaru specialippudo is original creamy tonkotsu broth served with thin and straight noodles pork belly pork loin bean sprout black fungus and spring onion a classic hakata style ramen selection of noodles soft medium hard or very hard love the ramen but am not so sure about the char siew or the  layered pork which i did not find to be tender goma kyuri crunchy japanese cucumber with home made sesame dressing refreshing renkon chips crispy tasty lotus root chips nice crispy beef tataki well marbled prime beef slices pan seared and served with tangy soy sauce good lemon soda a non alcoholic cocktail made with fresh lemons and mint leaves refreshing,Positive
ippudo,loveddd the ramen here came on a wednesday afternoon and there was no wait you cannot go wrong with the original broth and medium for noodle hardness the pork was tender and flavorful and the umami egg was cooked perfectly this is comfort food for sure really enjoyed our meal,Positive
ippudo,while it is not the most impressive but it carried the title of being an authentic japan noodle this is my nd visit despite it is a busy day of its rd anniversary celebration it offered real cheap pricing of   for per bowl of ramen it did not cut cost or scrimp and save its ingredient it is still the world renowned ippudo standard hence i round it up to a  star even though it is a,Negative
ippudo,quick stop over in s pore and always love this place great service and food is excellent i prefer to get the standard ramen with extra noodles always hits the spot before i crash and try to get some sleep there are several other ramen shops in the plaza so make sure you go to right spot on the th floor,Positive
ippudo,quite disappointing to be honest while the noodles are ok the broth seems to lack the flavour of some other ramen places a lot more expensive than standard ramen joints i am not sure what the price premium is for,Negative
ippudo,checked this place out on a business trip to singapore it was located in the mall right across the street from my hotel i tend to want to check out ramen places and pho places no matter what city i am in just to benchmark i am glad i did here good savory broth noodles cooked perfectly zero complaints on that front i did not know what to expect reading it was hakata style but was pleasantly surprised especially knowing i was trying ramen out in a mall which in the us is usually a recipe for a blech kind of ramen experience paired our ramen with gyoza which was perfectly seared and fried as i so often do i benchmark against santa ramen and ramen dojo here in the bay area this place is not as good as those but it is a place i would most definitely come back to the next time i come back to singapore do not let the fact that it is in a mall predispose you against giving it a try it wo not knock your socks off with a two by four but it is good decent ramen,Positive
ippudo,omg the food here is delicious you get to customize how thick you want your noodles and how spicy you want it to be all in all the akamura special and karaage was good,Positive
ippudo,i lived in japan for quite some time and i have traveled around the world a bit so for me it is quite hard to eat something not entirely local in a different country from where the food was invented i love ramen so going at ippudo was a bit of a challenge under certain points of view but being in singapore i take less risks than eating ramen in europe for example anyhow ippudo ramen is very close to the real deal tonkotsu soup is rich and tasty ramen are perfectly made no complaints there only note of demerit is the fake japanese atmosphere where everyone shouts in japanese welcome phrases but know no real japanese language apart from those lines then again it is all part of the atmosphere so it does not really matter in the end,Positive
ippudo,truth be told the ramen is nice hardness of ramen good not too hard nor mushy char siew is soft and tender soup broth is thick and tasty so would i go back again not quite sure i mean i had nothing going wrong with the meal there was no queue going in service was good food arrived swiftly food is tasty bill was settled quickly so what is wrong with me i supposed it is the up market feel that maketh my lunch to be more expensive that i was willing to pay for,Positive
ippudo,i love that they serve luke warm water instead of cold water because no one wants to eat hot noodles and drink cold water at the same time your teeth will get destroyed anyway great food and great staff must try the pork buns get them at pcs at a cheaper price,Positive
ippudo,so came to singapore wanted to see if they could make good ramen ippudo in japan is pretty big and well known so i thought what the heck well the broth is substandard here and way too salty with no real fat to coat the tongue the noodles were basic also the special egg they used was pretty unimpressive also and the chasu is hard and not well flavored i have eaten better ramen pretty much everywhere it does not compare to the ramen in japan at all or even the us has way better ramen just sad go elsewhere plus the price is ridiculous for suck subpar food total disappointment,Negative
ippudo,one of the best ramen the ambiance is very good i will definitely come back for more,Positive
ippudo,service staff was quite short with us emphasizing their need to get everyone out over the customer is experience despite the place listing an pm closing time they stop taking side dish orders at pm and ramen at pm the ramen was only average despite the  price tag this was my second time here and unimpressed with the food service and pricing i will not be returning,Negative
ippudo,i used to live in tokyo and visit ippudo at least once a week for their amazing lunch special for  yen you got ramen gyouza unlimited rice and tea there were also yummy spicy moyashi bean sprouts on the table i loved ippudo in tokyo no lines good food homey atmosphere then i went to ippudo ny a terrible experience that has destroyed my taste for any ramen so then here i was at ippudo singapore the line was not too bad and we got seated relatively quickly i got my usual akamaru ramen and gyouza the gyouza was not as good as in japan the akamaru ramen was perfect but alas ippudo manhattan has permanently scarred me for ramen i cannot eat it anymore without feeling really sick lessons do not go to ippudo ny ever do go to ippudo in japan and singapore enjoy the best ramen in the world since i cannot anymore best dish akamaru ramen,Positive
ippudo,i like that ippudo always has a seasonal menu serving up special seasonable ramen my standard order though is the spicy tonkotsu ramen with egg tonkotsu broth with spicy miso which adds a kick to the otherwise very thick soup noodle portions are pretty small but you can order an extra serving of noodles the line is very long so definitely go early to avoid the wait,Positive
ippudo,we stumbled here after striking out at a few other of these multi story mall type places and we should have just started here we started off with the piping hot melty cheese over rice and wow it was so good finished our meal splitting ramen that was tasty had good spice and they brought us a couple bowls to make splitting easier great service even though we showed up not too long before closing time and a great meal,Positive
ippudo,yum this is the best ramen i had during my stay in singapore i have eaten ramen in japan and this was pretty close the opportunity to customize your meal is great the broth was delicious and so were the cucumbers and the gyoza,Positive
ippudo,my only criticism was the wait we tried to make a reservation but apparently they do not take them it is just a little annoying when you try to call ahead and then you end up waiting anyways but other than that the food was great it is pretty hard to go wrong with ramen though i think the broth was at a good temperature and the toppings were tasty i am glad you can choose the hardness of the noodle too i think that choice goes underrated in a lot of ramen shops the interior was really nice of course the open design was good a little bit loud but still nice we had a spot right in front of the kitchen which is always a fun experience i would not give it the title of best ramen in singapore but yay i am a fan,Positive
ippudo,this is my comfort food for saturday brunch if i felt like having something soupy this is my comfort food for weekdays dinner if i felt like having something spicy soupy this is my comfort food on weekends afternoon after a hangover this is my comfort food on a rainy day,Positive
ippudo,like usual for hakata style ramen ippudo is still the king the ramen is excellent like usual and service is fast and attentive came during late after lunch hours cannot go wrong with ippudo with its ramen,Positive
ippudo,the ramen noodles are good no doubt about it the broth is rich perhaps too rich as an appetizer i love the lotus root chips i am not giving  or  stars because they do not refill teapots and wo not serve hot water either as a restaurant in a tea drinking country serving food of another tea drinking country this is just unacceptable one pot probably just  ml costs  not cheap,Negative
ippudo,i am personally not a huge ramen fan but ippudo is dishes were as authentic as it could be you can choose the texture of noodles soft medium hard for each ramen and customize the toppings we also ordered the cucumber appetizer that my friend recommended and we are glad we ordered it as it was a good refresher from the creamy ramen broth peak hour is from  pm pm so go early if you want to beat the line would recommend it for casual dining,Positive
ippudo,i visited ippudo for the first time last week and had a pleasant experience i was expecting a line but was surprised so see only one party ahead of me then again it was past pm on a sunday i ordered a bowl of karaka men spicy tonkatsu and a calpis soda the food was delicious as expected and i am sure there are ramen experts out there who are better equipped to provide a concise review on the food however i just just wanted to mention that my positive experience would not have been complete without the fine service at ippudo the staff were friendly without being overbearing and annoying polite and attentive all of which are as common as a minister taking the mrt congratulations to ippudo singapore i will make it a point to return soon,Negative
ippudo,my basis for trying out ippudo is because it is the biggest ramen brand in the world i had read about the akamaru shin aji modern tonkatsu ramen and came here prepared to order it perhaps my expectations had been too hyped up i was expecting an out of this world broth that would blow my mind and scream umami reality very good though nothing incredible the broth was a tad too oily for my liking and not as flavorful as advertised i ordered the special so it came with ajitsuke tamago flavored egg char siew cubes and bamboo shoots i personally prefer my ramen eggs to be on the slightly runny side and the yolk in this one was  hardened the char siew slices that came in the ramen itself was fantastic soft and flavorful but the cubes were a a little too dry and hardened it is hard to get bamboo shoots wrong so i finished all of that i do not care much for ramen noodles themselves so i wo not comment on the texture or quality overall i would say ippudo is a dependable brand of ramen i would compare it to starbucks maybe decent and consistent but not memorable just like how if you really wanted a special kind of coffee you would go to a family owned caf if you really a special bowl of ramen you would go for those hole in the wall places ideally run entirely by japanese staff,Negative
ippudo,the queue was a bit of a put off but you know what they say good things must wait we were not let down we ordered the miso tonkatsu and the spicy miso tonkatsu and they were so delicious we did not event talk until we finished eating and drinking all the soup in the bowl the broth was very tasty and pork was very tender we had to share a table with a group of  other people but did not mind because everyone was eating their food in silence when it came,Positive
ippudo,so this is the faaaaaamous ramen that is worth queuing an hour for huh well if you are able to slide in at  pm you will be treated to no queue and pretty much have your pick of the tables located on the th of mandarin gallery it follows suit with the mall is equally pricey options their regular ramen starts from  not including singapore is syndrome  gst  service charge i really like the fact that they ask for your noodle texture preference soft medium or hard i dunno about you but i am pretty picky about enjoying my noodles al dente medium texture is perfect for that to be honest the taste of the ramen itself is probably only worth about  stars the broth is incredibly rich and borderline too fatty oily the portions are probably not worth the price but hey you are technically paying for the brand the real standout is actually the char siu pork so flavourful and tender the extra star goes out to the staff who were super sweet that day i accidentally left my camera at the table and they actually came out of the restaurant to try and find me after i realised what had happened i went back and they had kept my camera safely at the front counter for me really appreciated that gesture and it was one of those rare instances that i did not mind the extra service charge one bit,Positive
ippudo,did not have to wait for a long time to get a table on a busy friday lunch the food was great could not say anything other than a  star for this one time experience,Positive
ippudo,extending my review from nyc on ippudo simply amazing as it is ranked one of the top five in japan it lives up to its expectation in nyc japan and now in singapore queue is always long so be sure you get there early and do not forget to try the original ramen they have,Positive
ippudo,we got here when it opened to avoid the long wait since they do not take reservations i think for weekends especially there was no wait but by the time we finished there was definitely a long line moving from ny with the extremely long wait but delicious ippudo there and having tried the disappointing no wait ippudo tao in sg i wanted to give the main sg ippudo a chance i ordered the akamaru tamago and the pork bun the ramen was very good and definitely redeemed my thoughts about ippudo in singapore the pork bun was a bit underwhelming having tried the pork belly buns in ny perhaps it was because the ny ones were pork belly instead of just pork the fat really must have made the difference haha i would definitely come back at an odd time to avoid the wait again this is probably not the best ramen but it is up there the service was attentive and my water was always being re filled i love when i do not have to flag down someone to re fill water,Positive
ippudo,i have been here  times in   years and have tried  dishes this place is ranked  out of  places i have been to that is in the top  it is one of my favorites i have also been to the ippudo in nyc  times the ippudo in kyoto and the original ippudo in hakata dishes i loved akamaru shin aji ramen i have had this  times the broth is out of this world i always get extra noodles and leave no trace of broth after i am done this version is better than nyc and hakata the kyoto version is comparable ippudo orginal salad i have had this  times dishes i failed bakuretsu tofu tarutaru chickenthe akamaru ramen is on my favorites in singapore list,Positive
ippudo,love the rich tonkotsu broth it is definitely done right on the thicker side full of umami goodness the chashu is also very flavorful my favorite is the spicy tonkotsu ramen the price is one of the highest i have ever paid for a bowl of ramen though and you would have to add on the egg for some of the items on the menu the appetizers are very tasty i recommend the wings a good treat every now and then,Positive
ippudo,i headed to ippudo by chance was around the area when my friends and i were craving for ramen for dinner since it was somewhere that many people have been talking about we decided to try it for ourselves i had their spicy char siew ramen the broth was nicely rich and was comforting to drink ramen cooked al dente char siew was well done essentially a decent bowl of ramen which most will enjoy but i did not quite get the oomph i needed from the bowl my friends say that their egg is the best dish on the menu i might need to return to figure that one out i will say trying it for the sake of trying,Positive
ippudo,i used to live in new york city and ippudo was my drug on weekends i am used to lining up for hours just to get into this joint this particular outlet serves really awesome hakata style ramen in a chic building in the middle of orchard road fancy a power lunch ippudo fancy a spot of tea ippudo fancy waiting h for a seat for dinner ippudo i must say that the pork buns do not taste as good as the ones in ny but pork belly who can say no,Positive
ippudo,maybe it is because i had high expectation i though the ramen was good but did not hit it out of the park or me that said the ippudo pork belly bun is a must have,Negative
ippudo,ippudo has been one of the most talked about ramen places every since it opened in singapore and the queue that never fails to form outside the restaurant is testament to its reputation however i do not think that the standard of food served here lives up to its reputation and the hype the ambience is nothing special either and can get a little too noisy at times i had the char siew ramen the broth i had was overly salty and left me very thirsty for a very long time after too much msg i suppose what i liked most about my dish was the egg as it was cooked perfectly hard boiled on the outside yet a little wet at the yolk other than that its your average ramen place just a little more expensive and a lot more crowded,Negative
ippudo,what to say i am a huge huge fan of ippudo whenever i think of ramen now i will think of ippudo love the texture of the noodle i always order the hard version for the ramen not fogetting to mention my love for spicy shrimp mayo the mayo really goes well with the freshly fried shrimp  in a plate is definitely not going to satisfy me enough lastly please go early to avoid the queue even during weekdays it will be super crowded,Positive
ippudo,this japanese restaurant is tucked in nicely in mandarin gallery pretty chi chi but it is quality and menu is worth checking out the quality of their noodles is amazing fresh and their ramen portions are huge i had the sesame salad the last time i was there and it was fresh healthy and really really yummmyyyyyyyy what i love their authentic japanese fare their dumplings were amazing i had the salad which i returned to have another time as well what i do not love their prices they are pretty steep though their food is yummmy a starter green tea and a main would set you back  at least i spent  on my last visit they also do not seat you until your whole party is there thus my friends had to wait  mins though a reservation was made that was not fun,Positive
ippudo,is it the best ramen in singapore maybe maybe not but ippudo is now one of my favorite ramen places here and it makes some of the best ramen broths anywhere the central location and beautiful open design in mandarin gallery also add to a great vibe here food the ramen is the star here but it is not just about the noodles i liked the thinner texture here but the combination of broth and toppings the charsiu is nice and tender the broth here is intense rich and well flavored i had the seasonal variety with black miso a touch of garlic oil and spicy oil that broth is worth the trip the pork buns are way too hyped up here i tried those as well as the shrimp buns and was completely underwhelmed the buns are tender as is the meat but there is not much flavor in the meat the shrimp were also small and the batter was way too thick there is no wait if you are here before  pm on a weekday i have not have no desire to experience a weekend wait but there is a decent bar and waiting area if you have to wait,Positive
ippudo,i used to love this place i would get the akamaru sometimes with a side of stuffed chicken wings which was surprisingly good i dragged my parents here quite a few times but i began to realize the soup is way too thick salty and tasty for me and it is just become not worth the wait i prefer ramen keisuke at orchid hotel marutama etc to this the taste is very similar to the original branch in new york and one in malaysia though so props to that i suppose,Negative
ippudo,wow now i get why some people crave ramen cannot go wrong with pork bun and one of the specialty ramen options pork bun may be top  favorite things i have ever eaten,Positive
ippudo,when i still lived in the states i went to ippudo everytime i visited new york i was so excited when i found out that they opened a branch here in singapore imagine my excitement and my high expectation when i came to their branch in orchard road though the place has always been crowded the service is really good at least at the time i came there the waiter waitress are very attentive when taking my orders and when making recommendation to my friend who is not familiar with ippudo before i ordered tonkotsu and the pork bun they were as good as i remember will i go back again definitely i could pretty much say that so far ippudo is the only ramen restaurant where i get my ramen craving fix in singapore,Positive
ippudo,my favorite ramen in singapore i first tried it in mandarin orchard   years ago then i went to another branch recently i think it is this one and i always go for the one that has the black garlic in the broth yummy but do not eat here too much because it is got a lot of fat in the broth but that is also what makes it good i think i also like their gyoza,Positive
ippudo,yes delicious ramen i am somewhat spoiled by momi ramen in brickell miami but this will do until i get home slurp yummy,Positive
ippudo,overrated the restaurant banks on its name being big in japan and charges an extraordinary amount of money we paid  each also had beer and appetizers which is ridiculous this is ramen the ramen tasted good but was not worth the money there was nothing special and there are lots of other ramen restaurants that can be had for half price ramen champion etc do not believe the hype,Negative
ippudo,came to ippudo with a couple of colleagues last week i was interested in trying this location out as my only other experience at ippudo was the one in new york with my girlfriend i had high regards for ippudo based on my experience in nyc but sadly i must believe that the experience i had here in singapore did not meet that expectation we arrived to a queue of about   tables ahead of us we arrived around pm and it seemed to be a good time to come as tables were turning over we managed to secure our own table there appeared to be options for a more communal big table experience too i ordered the shiromaru special that included an egg bamboo shoots and cubed pork served on a side plate generally the ramen was nice and firm and the broth was rich i would have appreciated if they had actually served the special with the extras in the ramem as they tasted cold when left on the side plate i have sought out many ramen places in my short lifetime thus far and while ippudo ranks in the upper half it definitely is not the best i have had would not feel bad recommending it to someone if they enjoy ramen,Negative
ippudo,long lines during lunch time but not as good as the one in japan too salty and noodle was overcooked still rich broth and quite authentic compared to other ramen places run by singaporean owners,Positive
ippudo,the good best ramen in singapore forget what the self appointed ramen heads say atmosphere is good service is on the ball the bad always packed probably the longest line aside from astons god only knows why people queue there the ugly many people stick their noses up because of its chain restaurant feel reputation i say good food is good food regardless of how many outlets there are i do not need an authentic experience to appreciate good food,Positive
ippudo,it was good the restaurant is really loud and the waiter keeps yelling for some reasons ramen was good though do not order chilli on the side it costs   i was not aware until the bill came the pork buns are not as good as what the reviews say if you have had them really good before you would be dissappointed,Negative
ippudo,shoyu ramen nice crunchy noodles good broth light and not too heavy perfect for those who prefer clear soup rather than a thick creamy broth  love the egg tamargo so used to having my tamargo cold and placed on top a shushi but ippudo is take on the hot tamargo has changed my stereotype of it being a solely cold dish definitely like it hot better now not many japanese restaurants serve it this way their tamargo is like an omelette but slightly sweeter however the only downside is the   hour queue definitely not worth the long wait i recommending going during odd hours like pm no queue,Positive
ippudo,tried the gyoza the spicy black ramen and the akamaru ramen the gyoza were excellent nicely cooked and still piping hot when they were served the spicy black seemed to be a seasonal dish it was peppery spicy and full of flavor the akamaru was miso based and a bit peppery but overall much more subtle we arrived bang at noon so no wait the place was full by  so i would try and get there on the early side to avoid a log wait,Positive
ippudo,what when dinner on tuesday night after chinese new year wait  minutes arrived pm sat at the bar as it was two of us nice ambiance loved the music too actually but it was too loud to shazam tho not too loud for convosfoood  shiromaru chashu and shiromaru kakunifirst went for the soup very yumm and as authentic as i can tell then the ramen so they have some thinner version of ramen and it was perfect they even ask you if you want it soft medium or hard if you want  not too bad shrimp buncrispy shrimp yummy hot stone unagi ricedecent but plain for some reason i felt like it was missing something more exciting after the tantalizing ramen and shrimp bun i am definitely gonna be back to try all the different ramen,Positive
ippudo,very crowded but worth the wait in line ordered the original ramen with the whole shebang its one of the best ramen i have had in singapore also ordered the pork bun which is good for starter they also have umeshu cocktail which i would try it next time,Positive
ippudo,i love their akamaru ramen and pork bun will definitely return to ippudo for singapore vacation,Positive
ippudo,blahh nothing nearly as good as the nyc one nope not the ambiance not the ramen nor the pork buns which are my fav at ippudo ny food there taste and look like a more expensive fast food ramen joint or maybe now that i live in asia my expectation for good jap restaurant has raised or maybe they are just a fast food ramen joint,Negative
ippudo,if you have been to japan ippudo you will very much prefer the ippudo in mandarin gallery the taste is richer and the noodle is tangy this shop is not easy to locate for first timer but one can easily spot the queue on the level  of the shopping mall service is good and you will get to choose different types of soup and noodle as well as the side dish to go by you will not be disappointed with the char siew and soup as the quality is well managed however the price is on the high side and i would recommend this as one of the best ramen shop in town interior design is great with a woody touch giving patrons a homely feeling but keep in mind the close proximity between tables and the long queues might not make this an ideal place to chill out,Positive
ippudo,one word overhyped i was really excited to try ippudo after hearing relatively good reviews from websites and friends i visited with my brother and the wait was not too bad we visited on a weekday lunch and it took us about  minutes before we finally got a table still within reasonable waiting period in my opinion we ordered the shiromaru and akamaru ramen with no add ons the ramen itself was rather bland and forgettable but the broth was pretty good i just feel that for  per bowl the taste could have been better i did not find anything special about the ramen except for the soup perhaps the pork was normal nothing special so overall nothing much here,Negative
ippudo,it all began when i saw the long line outside a japanese restaurant at st mark is place in nyc as singapore has taught me a queue must mean something is good for the taking so i joined it for an hour long wait in the blistering new york winter and was rewarded with a steaming bowl of springy noodles with chashu that has been cooked so long in broth that it melts like butter in my mouth this was ippudo new york a year later i heard ippudo was coming to singapore and was insanely happy even though it was not nearly the same and the chashu here was not as mind blowing the rich broth of the red bowl and the same springy noodles convinced me to order kaedama additional order of noodles to add to your remaining soup my husband who often has half a bowl of soup left over in his ramen bowls polished off the whole bowl of splendid broth  months later i completed my homage when i went to roppongi hill is ippudo in tokyo this was the ultimate chashu shrine and which all ippudos aspire to be i think while the wait staff at ippudo mandarin gallery attempt the same level of enthusiasm as their counterparts in tokyo i am reserving my fifth star for when their chashu attains the same melting quality this beats tonkotsu king i feel but then again perhaps my feelings towards ippudo are heavily influenced by my experiences in all three countries,Negative
ippudo,update when i wrote my first ippudo review i actually have not been there for months maybe a year in fact for some reason a couple of weeks ago i decided to give it another go and to my pleasant surprise ippudo has improved one of the reason why i disliked ippudo was that their ramen broth was always lukewarm by the time it got to the table but now it is much hotter and this really matters you can also choose the hardness of the noodle now which is another important factor ippudo you are back on my go to list,Positive
ippudo,the food at ippudo is always a welcoming treat especially after having one the worst ramen in a so called best ramen restaurant in london service is just okay cannot really expect too much in asia even if it is singapore,Negative
ippudo,we got introduced to ippudo through one of our friends who raved about the pork bun i would skip it here since the meat it cut pretty thin and it was just mainly sauce on a bun nevertheless if you do come here get the ramen it is pretty damn good pricy for a bowl of noodles but it is definitely quality stuff the broth is truly flavorful,Positive
ippudo,always fantastic the sg ippudo offers a few things not found on the sh or nyc menus including more ramen selections that are customizable the sg location was a little darker than the other two but the food just as phenomenal great service great food unfortunately it is much more expensive than the other two but i guess that is just singapore prices,Positive
ippudo,i have not tried the ippudo in nyc or in japan although i wish otherwise i will one day for now the ippudo in singapore opened to amazing fanfare they were i think one of the first superstar ramen places to set up shop here i like the ramen enough all of it i just do not love it the way i love nantsuttei,Positive
ippudo,years ago i would never have thought of eating at mandarin gallery but in the past two years more and more restaurants and cafes have been opening up and gaining popularity using the expensive upper class feel of the area to complement their fine cuisine however i was not too fond of the ambience at ippudo with loud music playing in the background a stark contrast to the other quieter and more relaxing restaurants in the building the tonkotsu ramen though i really liked the soup was good enough to drink the noodles were springy in texture while the pork belly was soft and decadent the egg was also cooked just nice with a slight runny yolk the normal ramen costs  while the egg added an additional  but was well worth it the sides on the other hand was less outstanding i did not really like the rather tough gyoza and though the shrimp mayo was rather good it was not quite worth the  for  shrimps ippudo is slightly pricey with an average meal costing about  to  with drinks but the ramen lives up to its reputation the biggest thing putting me off though is the queue which goes round a table inside the small restaurant and out of the restaurant and groups with  or more people will not be seated until everyone is present if you go there try the sakura flower tea for a more unique tea experience,Positive
ippudo,this is one of my favourite ramen places because the deco of red plush seats is amazing and so is the delightful array of ramen types you can choose from the broth does not disappoint and you can even choose the tanginess of your noodles and strength of your broth their sides and desserts are pretty good too the only drawback is that this place seems to draw long lines the last  times we were there we had to queue for half an hour and the waitstaff refused to seat us until all our guests have arrived,Positive
ippudo,ippudo came to singapore with much fanfare but i am sad to say that it does not really live up to the hype i am not saying it is not good it is definitely one of my top few choices if i were to have ramen but it is not in my top  having been to an ippudo outlet in japan before in yokohama i would say the only similarities between them are the long snaking queues when it comes to the ramen the portions and condiments found in ippudo here pale in comparison taste wise i can honestly say it is very close say  to what i had in japan the service staff here are decent but compared to the ones at santouka pale in comparison however for people who may not find santouka to their liking or for those who are new to ramen ippudo would be a very good choice to begin the foray into the world of ramen just do not bring them to ajisen to skew their views of what ramen should be,Negative
ippudo,absolutely fantastic top of the line ramen just delicious and deeply flavorful,Positive
ippudo,good place to try off the orchard road shopping district i stopped in on a recent business trip to singapore i little hard to find up a couple escalators in one of the shopping malls be persistent to find it i liked their many menu options and how you can build your own ramen as well as reload the noodles if you have some broth left broth was very flavorful and liked the egg and meat definitely worthy of a visit for area ramen fans,Positive
ippudo,the ramen broth is above average and the noodles come perfectly cooked i would have given it a four but the side dishes were maybe the same standard as any normal japanese restaurant also it is super packed and crowded which is really not a turnoff for me if the food is outstanding but in this case not worth it,Negative
ippudo,my second time at ippudo and yes the ramen is really good however after this visit i did leave wondering if it was that good considering the  minute queue and the  bill for two that is a lot of dosh for some noodles granted we also ordered some very over priced limonata and a gyoza to share but still i found myself questioning whether the quality price ratio was in order i had the poor belly ramen with the seasoned egg and yes the meat is tender and the egg was perfectly soft boiled but i did find the noodles rather salty you choose the texture of your noodle and i cannot say i found much of a difference between my boyfriend is firm and my soft you can pay a few dollars to have your noodles replenished if you have enough soup left in the bowl this is always tempting when placing your initial order but we manage to reign it in by the time we have slurped up our bowls the service is japanese friendly with the welcoming moshy moshy being yelled out left right and centre service is also efficient good when you are waiting and willing that waiting line to go faster but leaves you feeling a little short changed when you have eaten your  meal in about  minutes jury is out i might go back for a third time but i probably should try out one of the many other ramen options out there first,Positive
ippudo,the ramen is awesome and the pork buns are to die for with soft succulent meat gyoza is so so but looks popular however they are slightly more pricey compared to other ramen shops like marutama ramen however my biggest beef is the queue be prepared to wait around  mins if you go there at peak hours during dinner and lunch,Positive
ippudo,instead waiting on lines outside in ny you will probably better going here if you get a chance yes you will still have to wait in the same long line but inside a nice air conditioned mall so far the best ramen that i have tried ordered the akamaru chashu with extra tamago definitely worth the long wait the interior itself if very hip and modern almost like a lounge,Positive
ippudo,great and unlike the ny location which is the single most yelp reviewed restaurant in that city there is rarely a line,Positive
ippudo,to date this is my favorite ramen in singapore the noodles the soup the egg and the chashu the best combination i can ask for my usual order is usually the shiromaru tamago ippudo original tonkotsu with flavored egg also i like the interior of the shop it is simple and cozy which is really a great place to have a good meal and catch up with some old friends the staffs are usually quite attentive as well overall attributing a positive dining experience on the downside i really hate the queue sometimes the queue can get really long at the weekends and during dinner hours so to avoid frustration just avoid those times last but not least complete the ramen meal with a delicious and light sakura flower pot tea this is a must have for me whenever i visit ippudo as well the first time i tried it i liked it already it is enough to share with a friend but for some reason or another they do not allow refill for the pot enough said oishii,Positive
ippudo,by far the most authentic and best ramen in singapore the endless queue speaks for itself ippudo strictly does not do take away as they believe the ramen quality will be compromised there are million options to choose from but mainly they are broken up into spicy and non spicy miso or chashu base ask your server for a recommendation if you are unsure with every ramen tasting this good you wo not have to worry about your choice bite size gyozas are also a good add on to have with your meal fir drinks do give the aranchiata rossa and choya mix a shot a truly refreshing drink that will tingle your senses,Positive
ippudo,our family is favorite ramen place from when we lived in japan and the taste quality is almost same here service is so so but to be expected in spore,Positive
ippudo,great food the ramen was really tasty added pork belly and an egg the broth was great too they advertise three different versions of the ippudo bun shrimp pork and chicken but i only tried the shrimp it was not anything special,Positive
ippudo,this place is not that good food is bad servcice is bad kljfglagjlakgjkfladjgd,Negative
ippudo,best ramen in singapore too bad it is always packed,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,was craving dosa and only about a  minutes walk from the hotel not many places open early in the morning in little india ordered the pongal upma mysore dosa uttipam and mango shake they did not have any lassis in the morning very delicious and made to order was the only caucasian within miles and loved it for sure will be back when in the singaporean little india area,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,finding a friendly and fast south indian tamil restaurant in singapore should not be that surprising i think so yes i was not surprised by anything at komala vilas and apparently it is a pretty old restaurant which used to be good i am glad to tell you they are holding up pretty well the food was overall pretty good we tried everything from the spicy podi dosa to the soft idlies and to the foot tall cone dosa which was unsurprisingly shaped like a cone they all tasted pretty darn good and consistent the chutneys could have had a little bit of variation they all tasted pretty much the same which kind of got old pretty fast the best part about the meal was the glorious filter coffee it was bitter just so darn bitter and sweet exactly how south indian coffee should be it was a perfect way to wrap this breakfast up will drop by again when i am craving some nostalgia,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,komala vilas is a nice indian vegetarian restaurant in little india that satisfied our hunger around lunch time space can be a little cramped since it was busy and we ended up scaring our table with another patron the food was delicious i am normally a guy who needs meat in his meals but the wife was craving vegetarian i ordered garlic naan with mushroom mutton and she got the onion uttapam with three sides the garlic naan has visible bits of garlic covering it but surprisingly not overpowering with flavor i would not have minded a stronger punch of garlic but i do love garlic the mushroom mutton was also very tasty and not overpowering as far as flavors go i probably could have ordered another set of naan bread to finish the mutton with the uttapam was a pancake like food which we ordered the onion version of it is like much thicker dosai with a topping of your choice the sides were really good and my wife especially liked the curry one i personally liked the spicy one the white one reminded me of a cole slaw we finished the meal with a mango lassi which was refreshing not overpowering with the yogurt flavor which i appreciated you can tell a lot of locals cane here to eat which was a great sign thankfully they also had a sink with soap to wash your hands since the meals are eaten by hand overall really good experience and we would come back again,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,i asked an indian friend of mine for a recommendation where to eat in little india she told me to go to komala and so i did i felt a little foreign but the staff helped me to the best available to understand the many menu items do not ask me the three items i ordered all i know is that one was mushroom but they were really good and i enjoyed the many different flavors,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,komala vilas located in little india in singapore serves authentic flavourful indian food it is a vegetarian restaurant that serves amazing curries as well as classic indian breads a must try is the thosais which are massive long thin crunchy crepes that can be filled with a lot of things such as potatoes masala thosai or onions another must try is their vadai which are the donuts that are fried to perfection their poori is so light and fluffy and definitely worth trying all their breads thosais vadai etc pair excellently with the curries that they are served with they even have traditional indian desserts like gulab jamun their mango lassi is also very thick and has a lot of delicious mango flavour the restaurant is split into two floors with the upper floor being for rice dishes and the bottom floor being for breads and thosais this place is a definite must try,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,awesome south indian vegetarian food great prices too highlights were butter masala paneeraloo gobimasala dosagarlic naan,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,i looked up restaurants in little india on yelp and was not disappointed it is completely vegetarian so i was a bit surprised that there are no chicken or lamb dishes on the menu i ordered the vegetable meatballs in a masala sauce very tasty had it with garlic naan and a mango lassi my husband had the chappati meal which consists of different kinds of curries and sauces each one was nice but not noteworthy we enjoyed our meal but could have used something a bit more substantial i love plant based foods but it is nice to have meat curries as an option too for me personally i enjoyed my meal but just was not in love with it,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,every indian person i know from singapore could not stop telling me how amazing this place was so on a jet lagged morning i strolled in to taste the masala dosa and idli the masala dosa was no good no taste and the sambhar lacked your expected south indian punch the idli was good but i mean it is idli two points for the chutney if you want to eat better south indian breakfast hold on to your gut and try anadha bhavan or sarvana bhavan if you are upset with this opinion i understand i am spoiled by years of tasteful masala dosa and idli this spot just did not do it for me,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,this little indian cafe has garnered quite a name for itself within the little india area in singapore and when my friends and i were wandering around the area decided to give it a try since we were craving indian food i got the masala dosa   which is a crepe like bread filled with potatoes and onions and three dipping sauces on the side one appeared to be yogurt based another with chili peppers in it and then another that was similar to curry the food itself was barebones delicious and even at around pm the restaurant was packed there were side boxes for to go samosas that also looked delicious the menu is hard to understand if you are not familiar with authentic indian cuisine but everything is so good and the pictures provide a lot we were in and out quickly even though we ended up sitting down and is a good place to take a quick meal snack break while wandering around little india however bathroom is fairly hard to get to so keep that in mind when visiting and they often squeeze people very close to each other in the dining space otherwise a great authentic and local place to get indian food in the area additionally the restaurant is completely vegetarian so take note meat lovers,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,visited this tiny hole in the wall outpost a few weeks ago during my singapore trip chose to sat downstairs where you get the choice of alacarte menu the feast served on a banana leaf was not only scrumptious but brimming with good taste the only problem i felt was the way to the restroom was through their kitchen and not at all clean as per singapore is standard perhaps use the restrooms in the mall close by and come here to enjoy good food,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,dosai meal     starsvegetables left to right long beans potato bananasauces left to right green chili and coconut red chili and onion daal tamarind sauce cardamom dessertmasala dosai stuffed with a potato currythis was absolutely massive it would last me   meals at least thank goodness i did not order the paneer butter masala could definitely share this dish the first two sauces on the left always come with dosai according to the manager owner and the tamarind sauce usually goes with rice everything tasted good i suppose i did not give it  stars because i was a bit tired of the dish   of the way through masala tea     starsloved this spicy and not sweet there is sugar on the table for you to add ambience  starsdown to earth homey and clean you share a table if you are alone in a group of two which was nice i ended up chatting with a young sri lankan couple who knew more about indian food than me i will have to come back to try the paneer butter masala and the spinach dish,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,went there for lunch after a long day of exploring singapore so we were really hungry tried the palak paneer aloo gobi masala and plane dosai overall we liked the food a lot the palak paneer was my favorite also got the naan butter and garlic i thought the butter naan was better i was not the biggest fan of the sauces with the dosai we also tried the samosas the crust was a bit too thick and not very flaky the service was good even though they had a lot of customers food  service and atmosphere  price  overall,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,opens at am so good for breakfast if you do not have something at a hotel ok for inexpensive breakfast had the poori set which is  poori and  dal filter coffee was ok fine in this area where a lot of places are not open early,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,ever since i found komala on yelp i was craving for indian food i could not wait to try their food i do not have much knowledge comes to indian food but i know it was a good meal under s  even tho it was all vegetarian it left me content the drinks are rather expensive compared to the prices for the food i was very very happy until i saw the sign says c hidden under the cashier counter lol fortunately i did not get a stomache but i really do not wanna think about what goes on in their kitchen,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,a entire restaurant full of vegetarian options is usually an easy win for me and this place definitely delivered the food was really good and the staff here were really friendly the prices are very affordable and the portions are large the food does look deceptively small on the menu photos so i ended up ordered way more food than i needed but was very happy i got to try a little bit of everything,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,the first time i ever went to singapore over twenty years ago i got there very late at night and after spending the night at my hotel near orchard road got up early the next morning and took a taxi to komala vilas on serangoon road this was the first of many many visits with the most recent one being in late  i sat downstairs and ordered idlis a medhu vada and upma and then totally relished my wonderful breakfast for those who do not know what an idling is the answer is that it is a white colored soft discus shaped slightly sour cake generally  to  inches in diameter and made with fermented batter like masa for tamales using a mix of soaked rice and daal lentils medu vadas are savory fried donuts made from the same flour upuma is a savory version of cream of wheat cooked in ghee and with bits of fried curry leaves onions mustard and fenugreek seeds with bits of dried and green chilies plus chopped green coriander leaves by lunch time i was craving the food at komala vilas again and upon getting there and learning about the special unlimited meals in the upstairs section climbed the stairs and sat down at a marble topped table in a few minutes a server placed a banana leaf in front of me with many small steel bowls another server came by and filled the utensils with different south indian vegetarian preparations i was served rice papadums sambar and rasam and after asking for a fork started attacking what was in front of me never having expected to finish all my rice i was surprised when the server came around for more to find myself welcoming another helping it is unlimited and they will keep serving you until you say enough the stomach will get filled even if the palate will keep wanting more i have enjoyed this experience so many times without tiring of it often to the frustration of my wife who would like to try other terrific restaurants indian or otherwise on this magnificent gastronomic gem called singapore my big frustration is that if komala vilas in singapore can serve such delicious and perfectly prepared south indian food why cannot other similar restaurants outside india particularly those in the us do so even if some copy komala vilas name they fail to replicate its food if only the original komala vilas decides to expand to the san francisco bay area life could be so wonderful,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,people are ridiculous for giving less than  stars because they want meat it is a vegetarian restaurant if you are not ok with that go elsewhere pretty simple but i guess it is too confusing for some we loved our meals here we  adult  kids were on a budget so we skipped drinks and used the pitcher of water at the table for  usd we managed to get really good meals for all of us if we had more to spend we would haved ordered more but it is good to know what you can eat for less in singapore we were upstairs and did have about a  minute wait for a table i did not mind since a busy restaurant typically is a good sign not sure if the experience differs on the first floor we will be back next time we are in town,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,incredibly delicious vegetarian indian food nice family run place since  reasonably priced nothing fancy and filled with locals had the potato curry and chana masala with fresh baked burrita think that is the name bread that was the size of a child is head food was not killer hot spicy hot just pleasantly hot accompanied by a thick sweet mango lassi flavors were incredible loved it so much came back twice during a  day stay btw i am not normally into vegetarian anything but after eating here i could take that path samosas were hot spicy as they were loaded with peppers a piping hot chai masala was a nice way to end my meal do not miss if in singapore ps be sure to bring your own napkins,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,really delicious authentic vegetarian south indian food i tried the masala dosa uttapam and samosas and all were delicious and cost less than  even for so much food only downside is that it is cash only,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,the food here is similar to what i tasted when i was in india the masala tea smells good and reminds me the journey in india lots of people here especially india people maybe they can heal their homesick by eating their traditional food the servants are a little passive because they are too busy i guess try if you want to feel like being in india no worry about using hand or not they provide simple tablewares,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,so i am visiting singapore and everyone has told me to visit little india sure why not but i want to eat some good food here as well so i ask my native friends to take me to a place that has good food and hello here i am when you walk in you know it is so authentic there is a sink to wash your hands cause that is all you are gonna be using to eat with just the atmosphere and everything oh man you have got to try the mango lassi most i have had in america have been overly sweet but this this was on point yogurt mango and the perfect amount of sweetness so onto the food we ordered butter naan and regular naan and split several of the dipping dishes between  of us we ordered  dishes and boy they creep up on you i was so full by the end of the meal to be honest after a while all of them started to taste similar to me but i have low spicy tolerance and it was probably more of that speaking i am terrible at remembering names but there was this one dish that stood out that was green i believe spinach pea mixture anyway if you figure out which one that is you should try it big hit with our table,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,in town for  days on business and one of my co workers had a local friend who suggested this place as its where the singapore pm bought indian prime minister modi for lunch when the later was visiting singapore hey if it is good enough for modi it is good enough for me one tip strangest journey to get to the loos you walk thru the kitchen and the dish washer and there is only  unisex toilet and the floor was covered with water so definitely avoid trying to go to the loo here food wise this is a south indian place so you cannot go wrong with dosa however if you cannot tolerate too much spice like me just let the servers know because i did not and my dosa came laden with green chillies the sambar was truly lovely as was the coconut chutney not that big fan of the tomato chutney loved that you could get second helpings of the sambar and chutneys as well as the subzi for free the local folks we were with got an andhra plate i cannot recall if this particular item was available only on weekends or just sunday is but gosh that plate was turbo loaded with food no dosa include in this however unfortunately would def return as good food at great price and free second helpings,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,cone dosai   sgdwow super cool very big and fun to capture in photos very light and crispy good appetizer dish for  we also ordered the bharum drink nothing specialsweet as expected bright orange color stars goes to dosai only,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,it was our first night in singapore and decided to give this place a try as it was pretty late in the night the food was ok nothing fancy the restaurant was not very clean if you are famished and do not have many options late in the night this is a good place to grab a quick dinner,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,my boyfriend and i discovered this gem while traveling through asia for a month the fact that we are here six times during our trip generally during layovers between countries it is safe to say this was our favorite restaurant komala vila is located in the heart of little india when you enter the restaurant the staff will seat you downstairs or escort you upstairs depending on capacity then you will wash your hands because you wo not find utensils here the dish that kept both of us coming back was the masala dosa the masala dosa is a crispy crepe rolled up and stuffed with potatoes peas and delicious spices it is paired with three different dipping sauces i have no idea what they were or what they were called but the yellow one is delicious if you are in the mood for something sweet order a mango lassi drink it is a creamy yogurt based drink infused with fresh mangos i am salivating just thinking about my experiences at komala vilas,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,for breakfast they have a very limited menu i came at  am and was recommended masala dosa   potato curry stuffed dosa lacking in flavor the three sauces were lacking as well big portion samosa   texture was right but it was also lacking in flavor even when dipped in the chutney still not satisfying service was unfriendly my coconut took forever to come out leaving my poor mouth burning til the end of my meal after reading great reviews i was really looking forward to this place but you get what you pay for cheap mediocre indian food,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,vegetarian indian at its absolute best this place is located along the main road of little india i dined alone and was greeted by another solo woman diner she was so lovely sat with me told me how long she would been going to this restaurant and insist that i try the chai she even poured it for me i ate the best samosas i have ever eaten in my life here ate  plus chai for less than  sg this is my happy place,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,it is not clean partly because it is super busy be prepared to wait but the food is amazing dosa fresh and not oily bhatar i think that is how you spell it was killer we really over ordered a lot a lot and it was less than  for three people total and was the tastiest meal of our week long trip no alcohol or meat available amazing veg food excited about returning,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,fancy a sampler of all sorts of delectable indian breads look no further komala vilas has got you covered everything we have tried over several trips has been delightful but my two favorites are the crispy cone dosai and the puffy nearly soccer ball sized bhattura no matter what kind of meal you try it is guaranteed to be wallet friendly and delicious with well paired sauces i would recommend washing the whole thing down with a delightful lassi and maybe ordering a paneer butter masala as an extra dipping option for your bread do not be afraid to get your hands dirty as they have sinks with plenty of soap on the first floor service is friendly and fast parting thought i like sprinkling sugar on the crispy cone dosai it reminds me of the tissue prata at nasi kandar shops in malaysia,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,very nice vegetarian indian restaurant tried the chick pea chili dish and it was excellent,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,solid i got the lunch deal so much food for  i am not a local so i do not have a good comparison,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,great food with only indian locals we had the rice and chapati meals and various small sides and all were great  per person for a more than filling meal,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,great vegetarian restaurant and the dosa is are great i have not had one in a while and they are just the way i remember them but better they are light pancakes with crispy edges they taste better with your hands so dig in oh and order the mango lassi you wo not be disappointed,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,uhm  tomoto onion uthappam with  sides yea i am down not only was it good but the place had ac and the menu actually says what these items are made of i did not know that uthappam is just a thicker version of dosai of which dosai is made of semolina which is gluten free a nice plus i came here basically for some good indian vegetarian food and it did not disappoint restaurant setting with hawker prices,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,the first indian place that i visited when i first came to singapore back in  says a lot about the longevity of this place this still has the most inviting banana leaf meal with everything in a free flow mode most places only allow curry and rice for free flow simple as close to home food nice filter coffee kids love the big ball bhatura or the cone dosa wife likes the crispy rava dosa pleasant taste on the tongue and not too big a bite into the wallet either,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,i had visited komala vilas on my trip to singapore the restaurant has two stories the lower floor sells sweets as well as serves some customers the upper floor is where i think there is full service of customers i took my colleague who is originally from san francisco to this place a couple of times we ordered masala dosa bathura chole parotta and kurma during the first visit what can i say excellent he enjoyed it too on our second visit we ordered the lunch meals which was prepared well and plentiful all in all it was great tasting south indian food a couple of things south indian food is meant to eaten with hands mostly they have a wash basin to wash your hands but it would be great to keep it a bit more cleaner also they take only cash if you do not have cash there is an atm at a store a few feet nearby i am docking them a star because of the slightly dirty wash basin i will definitely be back and highly recommend this place,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,well i have a lot of fond memories with this restaurant i have been here during my every visit to singapore in last couple of years located in little india this place has been around for a long time this is no frill authentic south indian food spot the food comes out quick is reasonably priced they have a lot of options on the menu but me and my family would always order the traditional masala dosa with comes with sambhar lentil soup and coconut chutney cocunut sauce definitely a cool spot to hit when in singapore and looking for some authentic ethnic south indian food,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,wow what a great lunch found this place unexpectedly walking around and via yelp saw it was likely a good place to stop the ghee onion dosai was excellent so was the service,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,delicious food service is okay not the cleanest place i have been to but that is to be expected,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,food cannot be tried by other people you are dining with this is the first time i have experienced this i have been going to komala vilas for years and the service has always been good however i had the worst interaction today with the service staff and was shocked i had lunch with my sis and mum today i ordered an indian rice meal while the other  had dosas mine arrived first and both of them took a bite to try the food which was all they did when i asked for an extra helping of the vegetable curry which is the norm i was told due to our sharing my food i was not eligible to get more food the person attending to me was a manager so i explained that they had ordered their food and were just waiting he served me the curry without issues however when i asked a waiter he absolutely refused to serve me until i raised my voice i am disgusted and shocked i have been a loyal customer since i was a child and go to the restaurant at least once a month i even know some of the servers by face and name this is the first time i have had such a miserable interaction and it spoilt my lunch i am definitely going to stop recommending this restaurant to my non indian and foreign friends unless the service improves,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,i was craving some biryani and so i headed up the stairs of this old school restaurant on the edge of little india order from a small menu at the entrance pay cash take your seat and in a few minutes you get a tray full of delicious goodness hot rice with all sorts of vegetarian curries naan and spoon fork combo if you are a foreigner look i do not understand what the big fuss about how to eat this with your right hand as a local or with a fork like i have been used to the end result is all the same so leave me in peace while i enjoy my biryani purring like a bengali tiger my tastiest fulfilling and most affordable less than sg  with a bottle of cold water meal in singapore,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,love this vegetarian indian restaurant in serangoon they provide great foods and fast service i frequently go there when i visit singapore it never lets me down i specially like their poori bhatura rice meal dosa is and biriyanis,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,very authentic south indian vegetarian restaurant do not be shy because there might be no other caucasian guest,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,despite of very good reviews the quality of food is quite average good value for money though,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,probably some of the best indian food you are going to get in singapore will come from komala vilas they have come a long way in the last few years since a visit from  had left a lot to be desired but the recent one was definitely one to remember all the food is freshly prepared you can taste it and the service is very good as well i recommend getting the uttapam or the dosas and if you are into more custom delux dosas try the paneer butter masala dosa it is really divine the one other awesome thing is the prices you can go feed an entire family of  there for under   bucks easy and we are talking good portions awesome sambhar and chutneys and the whole nine yards definitely a great place to visit for indian fare,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,i had some great food at a really great price and there was a lot of it it was everything i wanted in an indian restaurant i will say though be prepared when you go in there the restaurant is not set up to cater to tourists,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,very tasty dosas with   veg toppings nice family style seating excellent mango lassi good value,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,an update the review below is for the serangoon rd location there are actually two other komala vilas locations within a couple of blocks of this one i had a meal at the race course rd location and it was just as good as the one on serangoon rd the race course rd location features some jain indian dishes i was planning to try some of those but they looked to be more ala carte than the other selections so i just got one of the combo meals did not even have to ask and they brought out another portion of one of the dishes i walked by the location on buffalo rd and it was filled with tourists in contrast to the times i have been at the other locations,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,i had lunch here and enjoyed it a lot for quite little money the place was full of locals which i took for a good sign staff was really friendly and helpful and the service incredibly quick the food was tasty as well and as far as i can judge quite authentic it is all vegetarian so no meat but all the tastyness does not make you miss it at all,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,i feel like i went to the wrong place the reviews here are way off i had an average masala dosa and a substandard masala chai the vada however was excellent i was treated like an outsider struggling to get extra anything while the servers made sure all the indian clientele had everything they needed would not go back plenty of good looking alternatives on the nearby side streets,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,much food we got good service and guidance even asked us for refill great tasteful vegetarian food and awesome mango lassi will go here again soon,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,this is my first review i hope i am rating the right one since the other komala vilas on a different street was not as impressive i had kottu here shredded chappati said to be a dish that originated from home where leftover chappati are used for this purpose and it was really good i liked the ambience and would go back again to taste the rest of the menu,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,had to fly halfway around the world to get a taste of the legendary komala was not the easiest journey found myself trapped beside a leathery old chinese guy hacking tubs of sputum at db every five minutes on an old air china  but this damn food is worth every mile and then some i went local and ate with my hand right hand tyvm but i may as well have just put it in a kiddie pool and splashed around needless to say my face lost the battle but my stomach was the true victor butter paneer masala  kinds of dosai sadly i missed the cone dosa chenna masala tomato uttapam bhatura the size of a watermelon the list goes on just plain marvelous and as a special treat at this location only milkshakes the mango milkshake was pure divinity i did not know whether to drink it or put a ring on the straw and slide my dick into its creamy depths until i can get across the pond again i will be dreaming of the otherwordly delights from the baddest of the bad k vilas jctsfr nan,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,this is one of my most favorite restaurants in little india it is  years old in  so this place has been around for awhile now they provide lovely vegetarian food from which i would highly recommend the ghee rava dosai and the parotta set if you would like some thing light for lunch for dinner i would go for a paneer butter masala with some naan the drinks here are particularly amazing go for an ice milo a rose milk or a sweet lassi they are all pretty sweet both literally and metaphorically,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,for the price they charge the food is pretty good but the ambience is very dull hopefully a renovation will get it more business,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,get here early and ask for the pongal it is warm and mushy i mean that in the best possible way and perfect comfort food the rice is soft and flavourful and studded with black peppercorns it goes really well with the tomato chutney it comes with also try the masala vada the mango lassi and obviously end with filter coffee,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,went to little india and ate at komala vilas the place was almost full but i did not have to wait for a table sat down and was helped by a freindly waiter i could not help but feel uncomfortable and out of place it kind of felt like i was not welcome i ordered the tomato and onion uthappam and it was delivered to my table with silverware as everyone around me had been staring in my direction since the moment i sat down i heard one person comment they brought him a fork i proceeded to eat my dinner with only my right hand and then washed up in the back paid and left i would give the food itself a four stars as it was flavorful however the overall experience was not very enjoyable and for this reason i will probably not be going back,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,the standard of food has dropped so much the thosai tastes so bland n the chutney is equally bland what happened to komalas disappointed the food tastes like hospital food,Negative
komala-vilas-restaurant,a friend was visiting singapore for the first time and we were showing him around for dinner he wanted indian food so we thought where else can we go but little india plus it was diwali and we thought it would be festive to go at night and see all the traffic of people and the decorations we searched online and decided on komala vilas coz it was so highly rated by a large number of reviewers also wanted vegetarian for a change we went during dinner time on a saturday and there was a small line waiting the line moved pretty fast though since this is a fast food diner kind of place and people just eat and go we got the paper dosai the cone dosai and the veggie korma curry with garlic naan to share i really liked my veggie korma curry as it was the perfect blend of creamy sweet and spice and went very well with the naan we saw everyone ordering a tea drink so we also asked for it after the meal it is kind of like teh tariq as it is tea with milk but less sweet and you have to pur it back and forth into a little bowl to mix it i failed miserably the first few times and kind of made a mess but that was still a lot of fun the tea drink is delicious so i would recommend you to get one if you are there service was efficient and we finished our meal within half an hour to move on to mustafa center very good stop for some snacks when you are visiting little india,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,this place has definitely changed my perception of restaurants at little india was pleasantly surprise to find the food here good and tasty do try the mutton briyani and the every simple teh tarik recommended,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,while living in new york my husband and i discovered south indian cuisine and particularly fell in love with the dosai we had a dosai guy and ate there probably close to once a week so when moving to singapore we immediately sought out of dosai fix once we found komala villas we never looked back the eatery is split between a more casual ground floor caf with desserts and light meals and the upstairs restaurant the big draw aside from the dosai is their rice meals you get unlimited rice and curry for   yes they have raised the price a couple bucks since we first came but it is totally worth it everyone in the restaurant is using their hands and speaking in tamil or other indian dialects we get plenty of strange looks when we show up however much like to trick of eating at a hawker is to stand in the longest line for eating ethnic food you know you are eating the real stuff if you are the only white person in the room try it out and do not be afraid to eat with your hands,Positive
komala-vilas-restaurant,delicious lunch sets the waiters continuously top up the plate with additional rice and veggies,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,i have been on a martabak craze since i landed in sin about a  days ago and i had to go to this place their indian martabak is really good it is close to what i remembered all those years ago in indonesia however i think the indo indian martabak had other things in it besides just meat and the martabak itself regardless love this place the cik that was helping me was a little terse but nice enough to hook this brother up w a martabak at close to  pm terima kasih cik,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,zam zam is one of the most famous place for din briyani in singapore with that it is extreme let crowded with tour groups dropping by to try it out the store is the same as it was  years ago and we sat at a table next to the kitchen i question their hygiene standards from what i saw nevertheless their dum briyani that cost  was yummy but i wo not say the best,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,they have indoor and outdoor seating i elected to sit outside as it is located right across from some historic buildings in little india arab street it is a great spot for people watching over lunch the staff are very friendly i am an indecisive eater when it comes to new menus and they were able to make really helpful and delicious recommendations if you are the appetite bigger than your actual stomach type like me you can dine in and order take out at the same time the staff are super helpful with that this is also located in the optimal spot for anyone who has some time to take a stroll through the rest of little india arab street overall i would definitely recommend this place to other tourists who are in the area,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,was lucky to get a seat as i stopped by with a group just as a fasting period was coming to an end the place was full and due to the holiday we were supposed to have put in an order earlier that day this left the only item on the menu to be the murtabak at first the group was a bit disappointed but then the murtabaks arrived i was stunned at how delicious they were and with the slight spice of the dipping sauce they disappeared from everyone is plate in a matter of minutes and they are fairly large definitely worth a trip,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,this restaurant came highly recommended for indian food since our family was visiting the sultan mosque zam zam was a perfect choice since it was right across the street from the mosque we were seated on the second floor of the restaurant which had air conditioning yay there were many tables to be seated at but the tables were too close to each other so it felt quite cramped our waiter arrived to take our order we got the mutton murtabak mutton biryani and pulled hot milk tea everything that we ordered was delicious the murtabak tasted like an eggy floury pancake with tons of flavorful mutton inside also the rice in the biryani had a great fluffy texture they did not skimp on the mutton in this dish either what i was quite impressed with was the pulled milk tea it was such an aromatic tea and had the right amount of sweet condensed milk it was even better than the best pulled milk tea i have had in hong kong the only thing was that the customer service was quite brutish here it is probably best to be very direct with what you want to order you can point to the menu items you want to get also be sure to confirm your orders too since our waiter initially got our order wrong he had to flag down another waiter to help him make sure our order was correct otherwise when i visit singapore again i will definitely be back here for their delicious food and milk tea,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,tried something new on arab street yelp led me to zam zam where i enjoyed the chicken murtabak flour eggs onion and chicken with a little bit of spice views of the masjid sultan friendly staff explained the menu and food was out in less than  minutes,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,starssingapore zam zam is a busy busy indian muslim food restaurant near bugis there is open air seating on the first floor and a much larger air conditioned dining room on the second floor to eat we started with the mutton biryani which was a pile of basmati rice with a tender piece of mutton in the center and a creamy curry on the side though tasty i found the rice to be rather bland compared to some other biryanis i have had since it was not actually cooked with the meat or with many spices we also had the special deer murtabak a stuffed flatbread filled with ground deer and egg overall the murtabak was rather bland and flavorless it came with a curry on the side for dipping but otherwise had almost no flavor on the plus side the portion sizes here were definitely generous for the price but i cannot say i get the hype about zam zam,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,authentic murtabak and briyani according my friend from saudi arabia my first time trying the cuisine and it was delicious we finished all of our food and ordered a second mutton murtabak cuz it was that good teh ice iced milk tea is a must try as well,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,zam zam thank you ma am this place is right on arab street directly in front of the sultan mosque the specialization here is biryani and murtabak i found the biryani to be on the bare side it is got a good mix of spices for complexity and although the mutton was tender and easy to peel i have had better murtabak is very good the deer option is their popular one and it is good it is an ideal shareable item it is pretty bulky and it is filling they are generous with the meat portion inside also you can try the fish head curry my opinion it is just okay it makes for a good picture but i found the actual fish to be rather tough not as flaky peel able this place has been featured on some travel programs and it is also a popular youtube travel vlog destination that said despite being a legitimate landmark mamak shop i will say that the food is good but not amazingly outstanding as i initially expected if you are from malaysia you probably will not be impressed and there is a  chance you will say brag to some extent about how the mamak food in malaysia is better than singapore otherwise this food will probably blow your tourist mind away it is good though,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,loved the food i was visiting sultan mosque and read reviews of zam zam it is right across from the mosque never had murtabak before so tried mutton biryani and murtabak and it was great very reasonable prices and great food,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,yes definitely yes good eats and reasonably priced we had the mutton briyani and deer murtabak they provide complimentary curry on the side it was delicious it is located in little india i highly suggest going to this restaurant instead of one of the restaurants in little india is main streets haji lane and arab st because they are so overpriced the food here is tasty tasty tasty you will see a lot of locals here which is a good sign it was a good find for us enjoyed it go upstairs there is air conditioning,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,as good as the hype said but service was a little spotty be prepared to be accosted on the street as you walk up and pressured into ordering before you look at the menu the small is huge so be prepared for a food coma,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,amazing service everyone is extremely friendly and the food comes relatively quickly tried the beef murtabek chicken biryani and mutton curry all were excellent the chicken was succulent and the sauce from the mutton curry was really flavorful,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,we found singapore zam zam on the lonely planet guidebook we wanted to try the murtabak a halal malaysian stuffed pancake we had a choice of beef mutton chicken or sardines we chose the chicken murtabak the chicken murtabak was excellent with the gravy sauce that came on a separate bowl the murtabak was otherwise bland tasting without the gravy the iced coffee was refreshing and complemented the murtabak they have a system to determine which coffee drink had milk versus none sugar versus sugar free i recommend stopping for at least a snack at zam zam when visiting kampong glam in singapore,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,must go restaurant when you are visiting haji lane very authentic muslim food and price is cheap too i think most of the tourist and local people eat at this location there is st floor and nd floor if you are seated on st floor ask the server to be seated at second floor since there is air condition i noticed that restaurant employees seats local people on st floor and tourists on nd floor i tried biryani murtsbak and fish head curry love the sauce when you eat with biryani great combination,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,best indian food that i had in singapore i would eat here every week if i could yum every dish we tried was great,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,this is a good place to go for a quick fix of mutton biryani despite being very popular i find their food to be on the average side do not expect a quite place where you can enjoy sitting down to talk with your friends zam zam is more like an oversized street food establishment with a roof on our top,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,the food here is soooo good my friend and i saw that this place got great reviews so we decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed service is not the best and the servers are not the nicest but the food definitely makes up for it do not overlook this place based on its appearance it is located right beside the famous arab street so for tourists like myself and my friend we could easily work over to explore the area right after we finished our meal a walk is also necessary after such a carb heavy meal tourists and non tourists alike have to try this place out,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,chicken murtabak was the best dish of the meal it comes in small medium or large and a small size is good for one person the roti was nicely browned and the chicken was moist with lots of flavor we also tried the fish biriyani but the fish was rather dry and the rice was intermittently flavored perhaps it was supposed to be like that but i would have liked a more complex flavor the curry that came with it also tasted mildly of lamb which was a bit off putting the iced teh chio was quite yummy but my friend said the teh c was not sweet enough also the tea was still piping hot when they iced it making the bottom warm while the top cold which made for a rather inconsistent drink service was spotty at best we were sitting right by the staircase where there were constantly waiters running back and forth yet it was almost impossible to catch anyone is attention it is possible that zam zam may have been a top notch joint at some point but like many other restaurants complacence and laziness took over making the food passionless and mediocre,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,stay away from the fruit drinks which for some reason though zam zam resides in a tropical country chock full of cheap tropical fruit like all the neighboring restaurants chooses to serve its blueberry juice with neon blue gatorade looking syrup and then have the gall to tell me it is blueberries no it is not stop the mutton murtabak is fairly tasty and is really helped out by the savory dal complete with sheep meat chunk to flavor it but they really skimp on the meat filling the pastry mostly with onions for  i expect some meat particularly in a city where  usually gets you full to bursting mutton is a strongly flavored meat and if i have to cock my head and concentrate to taste it you are not using enough,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,singapore zam zam just north of the city center is a neighborhood staple serving a variety of middle eastern and muslim singaporean food the price are reasonable and the building reminds me of late night spots in pittsburgh it is very casual and right by the local mosque there is outside seating on the street and air conditioning on the second floor everybody goes for the murtabak it is a cross between a crepe and an omelet stuffed with spiced meat and vegetables you rip off a piece and dip it in a curry this thing is delicious big time flavor and very filling we got some mee goreng which they did a great job with too you can get a huge meal for a great price and i would highly recommend it,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,delicious indian food had the prawn curry which was with tomato chili paste and onions mutton murtubak was really flavorful it was like egg and naan stuffed with onions and ground mutton fish biryanis was fragrant and flavorful,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,stars i really liked the flavor of the chicken murtabak although my brother preferred the beef seating upstairs during lunch time was a hustle and bustle rub your elbows kind of style the staff in our area worked very efficiently to seat people take orders and bus the tables for the next patrons,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,great food super cheap but cash only and you will be sitting close to your neighbors get the murtabak it is incredible,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,the murdock and the milk tea were delicious and the prices were soooo reasonable ambiance is non existent but the place is packed and the food is good close to mrt great place to stop for a good meal,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,chicken murtabak almost pastry like definitely the highlight chicken biryani comes with curry sauce ice lychee teaeverything was so flavorful and delicious price is very reasonable too less than  sgd for two people,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,decent food at a fair price service is passable the murtabak has multiple thin layers of dough that are somewhat chewy rather than crisp it is pretty filling and tasty the  beef murtabak is definitely a good large sized meal for one person in between the layers of dough are ground beef and onion but the flavor is fairly mild overall i would recommend using the fork and spoon to tear the murtabak into bite sized pieces and then using the spoon to dip the pieces into the curry the murtabak by itself is actually pretty mild in flavor and has a nice chewy texture the dough is spread very thin but it has to have enough gluten to do that so the chew is nice the curry has a mild body is not too heavy on the coconut and is very dense in flavor it is got good chili flavor some heat and some tang really tasty with the murtabak and really amps up the flavor skip the coffee seriously not worth getting tastes like stale maxwell house the service here is a little iffy the best tip is just to be vocal about what you want and when you want it otherwise you will be sitting patiently for a while,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,we came here stranded by the rain and decided to try a zam zams we got the lamb murtabak and an iced coffee the coffee was a weak nesquick with a malted milk after taste the murtabak for me was ok it is the equivalent of an indian paratha but with ground lamb inside and comes with a dipping sauce unfortunately i am allergic to a spice used in the dipping sauce and my throat got itchy and started closing up which ruined the remainder of the meal for me not like i got much in since there was so much filling i dropped half on the way to my mouth next time i would get the murtabak alone with a spatula to transport it into my mouth,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,i heard amazing reviews about their murtabak so i had to try one before leaving singapore it worked out perfectly since i also wanted to visit the sultan mosque you can order it for take out or eat inside their restaurant the venue itself isn a bit run down and the service is not the best but their murtabak is delicious i ordered their small chicken murtabak it reminds me of chinese dan bing i told the server that we wanted a small since we had breakfast not too long ago the small is suppose to be  but when i saw the bill the gentlemen charged us  sooooo i assume that he gave us the medium sized murtabak it is quite filling for a party of three unless you are famished you might want to also order an additional dish the murtakbak comes with a dipping sauce very watered down reminds me of a curry taste and cucumbers with some red sweet sauce compliments well with the murtabak i also ordered their house drink vanilla kathira you have to order it in a bottle reminds me of really sweet vanilla soy milk i enjoyed it try it when you are in singapore,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,the food here is overpriced the fish dish costs  and it is not worth the price the server is rude and kept rushing us up for ordering he took the menu from my friend without saying a word while she was still reading it,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,been going to zam zam for over  years the mutton murtabak and milk coffee is as good as the first visit in the s a must for any visit to singapore,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,awful experience from start to finish came around noon for lunch there were roaches crawling on the walls it takes forever to flag down someone to place the order service is practically nonexistent they were out of roti which was the main reason we came the complementary curry was the only tasty food we tried,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,enjoyed plate of chicken biryani and prata with tasty sweet black coffee wonderful flavors and outstanding service a must visit for the taste of india in singapore,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,we were nearby and decided to pop into zam zam as hubby has heard much about it we ordered beef murtabak crispy outside and generous inside with beef and onion bits  for a small one but fills you up good size for the price egg onion prata they do not have kosong prata so i opted for egg onion to up the flavour like the murtabak the prata is crispy and tasty what is particularly even more yummy was the fish curry it is really good that i asked for two more top ups the prata curry combo is power chicken biryani we were not hungry but just greedy so we ordered a chicken biryani to share great decision as the rice alone is al dente and flavourful the chicken is with not much sauce that i initially thought it would be too dry a plate to get maximum enjoyment i was wrong every mouth a delight and i ate more than i said i was gonna eat heh teh halia this is my usual go to drink and theirs did not disappoint thick and sweet and gingery just the way i love it the shop itself is a visual delight many things to see on the walls and around only after the meal did i realise that they have an aircon upstairs and they are apparently so famous that they made their own zam zam signs for patrons to take selfies with they also sell their own bottled water and also their zam zam polo tee if you like amazing well i am just there for the food,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,just the way i remember after  years i m back to the motherland for a visit this time around i purchased  small lamb mutton murtabak  each while the beef murtabak was  i ask the staff who handled my purchased for the gravy dhal instead of the curry that they offer my family often came here to purchase murtabak to go for special ocassions or to feed families members who came for a visit or its easy to feed a crowd with the murtabak purchase this time around both my mum and i do not fancy the slices of cucumber filled with the ketchup the slices of cucumber tasted old and it tasted quite bad hence for the ketchup cucumber we threw it away as for the murtabak it did not disappoint with the purchased both my aunts who now lived in malaysia also enjoyed the murtabak as good as they can even remember all in all zam zam restaurant is our to go murtabak stall vendor that has been our family favorite,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,delicious food and the murtabak and briyani were our favorite ask the server for vegetarian options service was very fast,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,if you have not been yet this is a  year old institution of singapore if you have to try couple of things i recommend the mutton biryani hayderabadi dum biryani where the meat is hidden under the rice and there is plenty of it and the chicken murtabak the later is made with ghee purified butter can be a little heavy if you are not used to it the beef masala is very good too there is a broad range of teas teh and local drinks great to sample the food is plenty enough for  and cost s  the restaurant has had a facelift new stairs upstairs is air conditioned brighter lights new flooring and nice and bright photos of dishes the walls have had a good scrub so it is nice and shiny this is my rd visit and am sure is not the last great place for a good hearty meal,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,zam zam is pretty much an institution for murtabak and briyani having been around for years though i only know of it a few years ago but pretty much everyone has heard of zam zam and it can get crowded even late at night there are more tables upstairs to accommodate the diners we were lucky to get a table at  pm as the rain probably kept people away we shared the chicken murtabak and mutton briyani both were really good the murtabak was huge and full of chicken pieces i was expecting a flattish murtabak which was my experience at other joints so this was a surprise the mutton was very tender and you could cut it with your fork the rice was flavorful with the mutton and the gravy was just perfect too teh halia was another winner though if you dislike sugar you will probably need to ask them to reduce it for me that is what a typical teh is sweet to wash down a heavy meal and you do not even need dessert after that,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,hit the place as it opened no lines fast and excellent service fresh crispy yet doughy murtabak chicken fish head soup prata to deal with the soup and iced coffee sooooooo good did not need to eat again till late in evening the murtabak really is filling and sticks to your ribs like a denver boot my husband is the best and cleaned up whatever i could not fair price fresh flavorful and fast fantastic,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,i was looking forward to this place based off the reviews but it is very greasy and low quality tried chicken murtabak deer and some beef all so so and so greasy and flavorless i really wanted to like it but i would rather eat at the hawker market or the mall food court or orchard rd it is a lively and interesting place right across from the sultan mosque in the arab street area maybe they make good tea or something else sigh,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,delicious food in a no fuss setting it can get hot if you sit downstairs there was a mix of locals and tourists eating here just after nine in the morning,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,how cannot i love this place cheap and good food from most of my experience do not expect too much of television shows have introduced the place so many times this is because there might be so many customers and it makes food and service quality bad i have to admit that there are many customers however the food is still good if you prefer to eat in a quiet place then this is not your place however if you would like to try good food during traveling come a must place in singapore,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,upon many recommendations i got the deer murtabak and mutton biryani both were fantastic choices and a lot for two people i would say it is perfect for   people the murtabak comes with two different curry sauces which complements the main dish nicely and softens up the crispiness of the roti the mutton biryani comes with one big piece slightly chewy at some parts but the pickled vegetable sides rounded out the dish we also got iced coffee which we found is typically brewed hot upon order then iced before it hits your table so it is lukewarm i do not mind that at all because it will eventually get cold there are not too many tables in here and it is indoors with an open front so you get the breeze from outside along the hustle and bustle of the streets i love eating at these types of places,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,the chicken murtabak is fried well and is delicious the mutton biryani is also tasty it opens at am but their is a waiting line already around  am smells good and not really spicy come and enjoy these foods here oh teh ice is a little sweet that is fine,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,i am surprised by the people who said service is slow i walked up at   on a weekday when everyone and their mom was out for lunch and i was seated right away and attended to faithfully the entire time i was there the servers were so nice too i had never heard of murtabak before but i decided to try it since this is what the place is known for it was soooo good i have an annoying amount of self control when it comes to food ie i stop before i am full i get food coma times a million so i just cannot but i actually ate the entire plate of murtabak i never do that it was so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with tons of chicken i could not believe it was only  dollars seriously me cleaning my plate is a testament to how good it was as i can never usually do that yum the iced tea came with limes in it which i had never had before and it went really well with the meal i am already thinking about going back for dinner ha definitely check this place out if you are in the arab quarter wandering around and need a bite but i did get major food coma as i knew i would so grab some coffee on your way out and wander around and digest,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,what can i say about this place it is the best place and must go to when you are in singapore love love love this country people and food you can find all kind of food halal food so muslims do not have to rely on seafood only,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,the food is excellent reasonable price must try if you are into this type of cuisine,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,love their martabak the best the guys who work there are nice and friendly they are very swift with the order it can be very crowded but it is worth it,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,first time trying murtabak and it was very good i had the one stuffed with chicken the pancake surrounding the filling was thin and had a nice taste of eggs the filling was lightly spicy with tomato like sauce curry inside chicken and onions and possibly other things i cannot recall all very yummy,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,zam zam is where grandpa brought dad for murtabak and where my dad brought me this place is a singapore iconhands down the best murtabak in singapore especially if you know how to order it get the regular size no the large it fries up better add extra mutton and egg have them fry it crispy they have fish and or chicken curry sauce i like the fish they also have jumbo curry prawns those are amazing definitely try them also try the mee goreng mutton briyani and assorted dishes with rice rte every time i am in singapore,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,it is definitely local food you will find here i like to bring my friends here when they visit for a taste of singapore the murtabak is the best ever and a must eat service is not the best because they can be slow but it is worth the wait prices are not the cheapest but the murtabak is worth the price it is also across the road from haji lane and sultan mosque which are worth a visit if you are around,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,really disappointing past few experiences here i used to come here maybe   years ago and the murtabak was always fresh and good past few times the murtabak have been dry stale and clearly pre made long beforehand it was barely even hot i get that things in a restaurant kitchen need to be done a certain way to avoid having to wait ages for each dish but for a restaurant that specialises and is known for this stuff they should be able to crank them out endlessly i keep thinking i will go back and give them one more try but have been disappointed again and again as others have said service is painfully slow but you are not at a fine dining place here maybe i will try the other mamak restaurant a few doors up,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,certainly a worthy trip to this place for good local indian food must try for the fish head curry mutton a la carte mutton murtakbak nasi biriyani cuttlefish and their tea tarik the place has been around a long time have a nostalgic feel to it but also mean unassuming plastic plates plastic cups and steel utensil so much for ambience price is definitely good if you are game for indian spice and stuff their fish curry and murtakbak is a must try upstair is air conditioned should help beat the heat,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,even though i enjoyed the mutton murtabak i did not think it was spectacular the meat was a little dry and the dish could be warmer cleanliness seems to evade this place as the plates utensils tables and chairs have that dusty half washed look i would come back again with friends since there are so many shareable dishes here,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,this gets five stars for what it is a local indian shop not all five stars are the same this is cheap tasty and casual five star this is where i was first introduced to murtabak and it has spoiled all others to follow this is an indian muslim restaurant that specializes in murtabak and biryani and it does both well although it makes it is name with the murtabak their murtabak is fantastic cooked just crispy enough stuffed with egg onion and garlic but it is not too greasy you can get it filled with chicken mutton beef deer or sardine and also vegetarian i recommend the chicken it is served with a tasty slightly spicy curry that is great for dipping they also serve other typical mamak shop foods such as nasi goreng and mee goreng both made in the bright red malay style all the food came out great but beware eat this for lunch and you will have a tough time staying awake in the afternoon as it is heavy and tasty,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,the curry chicken had a good flavor the menu was hard to read i never saw roti listed this place is cash only,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,this place is highly recommended by local and tourists my favorite dish is beef briyani they never let me down every time i ordered they do offer murtabak prata and chops but beef briyani is the one and the only i would order without failthe beef is so tender with a little bit of spicy yum yum yum the service is very fast sit down order they serve food within  mins,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,morning murtabak hit you say i am there running on a later time zone in singapore is tricky because most places open after am thankfully we found out that zam zam is serving up fresh breakfast roti nice from am so we beelined here for a cheap indian breakfast mid morning it was already busy so they sent us straight upstairs which was cooler and less cramped than downstairs the set up is pretty basic but it was actually more comfortable than i expected we ordered chicken and deer murtabak the chicken was definitely my favourite filled with delicious bright orange tandoori chicken deer was not bad but a tad dry and i probably would not order it again both were quite large and filling definitely satisfying out craving for the kind of breakfast we could not get at home in melbourne,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,i had my first good murtabak here shared with my ex classmates over a cup of tea tarik or bandung whenever i am here i am with a group i do associate this place with bonding sessions extremely painful wait for service for many years but when my friend did a takeaway it was speedy standard of food is on and off sometimes good or mostly acceptable,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,have to say that this place actually lives up to its hype i was not planning on stopping here but as i walked down the sidewalk with that yes i am tourist look on my face i was being ushered into a restaurant by some guy in a blue shirt standing in the middle of the sidewalk at first i responded with a quick i am good thanks but then the smells and happy noises coming from inside the restaurant caught my attention so i realized blue shirt is actually a zamzam employee and he was there to make sure you did not miss the restaurant side note the upstairs is chilled so ask to go upstairs if the first floor is too hot or too crowded so i go in ordered a feast as you can see the fish dish covered in a spicy red sauce was my favorite wow that was great the calamari was ok a bit chewy but missing a strong flavor i think if it was made to order it would be exceptional the mutton biryani well it appears they cook the biryani on its own then if u want mutton lamb chicken fish etc that just dig the appropriate protein outta the pot and into a plate then scope the biryani over the protein the actual rice dish was great the lamb meh overall i would give the entire mutton biryani a   cheap enough to order again but would not cry if they were sold out the fish head curry i honestly cannot review i was so full from everything else and that dish was so huge i did not know where to start i did pick a pea sized portion of the fish and i gave the whole dish to some homeless guys on the corner going off their facial expressions sound effects and speed when they realized what they had removing the packaging and digging in i would give the fish dish a  maybe next time i will judge it a bit better overall great experience i never planned to have,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,check out the news on google which the owner of zam zam hired gangster to slash the competitor i will not give my money to such businesses practise,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,one of the oldest places for roti prata in singapore but i dont like their approach towards business you cannot order plain prata for breakfast egg is the minimum and this is pre made next you cannot ask for more than one curry only thing good is the murtabak where they add mutton bits on the outside of the prata too there are many newer places that make a better prata and tastier curries will only come if there is no other option,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,zam zam salabim is all i can say this restaurant is truly enchanting as it offers amazing halal indian breakfast it may look simple but it tastes fantastic we order different pancakes with cheese onions and lamb stuffed which correctly are called prata here they actually rather remind me of puff pastry than pancakes anyway the way of eating pratas you rip off a piece of them and dip it into tasty veggie fish or meat curry sauce what a heavenly mess in addition to the pratas the biryani is the signature dish of zam zam the main component of these dishes is flavored rice it will come with spicy roasted meat you can also order a vegetarian version of course the rice is roasted with a good amount of onions chilies and nut sometimes they will add a few raisins biryani is often served with yogurt and mango chutney,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,had a nice chicken briyani and mutton murtabak so far one of the best of singapore a must try during your journey in arab street and sultan mosquee the kweo tweo was not so good,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,stopped in since the place i intended to check out was closed and because i had heard of this place previously had the deer murtabak the meat was ground and pretty much indistinguishable as being deer could have been beef or lamb for all i could tell the murtabak was far less greasy than what i had experienced elsewhere and the sauce that came with it was nice and spicy head upstairs for the air conditioning to escape the heat and humidity and be prepared to share a communal table if they are busy overall it was good not great with a million interesting places to experience amazing food in singapore i can check this one off my list but probably would not make a special trip to come back,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,recommended by a friend i would not know what to order otherwise since i do not often eat malay food i ordered the sardines murtabak and teh tarik both are delicious i will recommend this restaurant to you too,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,interestingly i am not really sure how i feel about this place despite its claim to fame as being the oldest and most famous place for murtabak in singapore we ordered the ground lamb murtabak and it was fine but i was not blown away the mee goreng however was very good i did notice that the taste was a little bit on the sweet side compared to the malaysian style mee goreng which is more savory in flavor the different is not good or bad thing but just a difference that i noticed in the mee goreng preparation the roti prata was passable at best the saving grace was being able to dip it into the side of chicken curry,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,we have heard so many good things about zam zam that our time to visit here was well overdue one night last week we caught a fast blue into the city and got dropped off right across from zam zam we expected it to be busy and it met our expectations however the super efficient staff found us a table on the second floor which is a little cooler than the first level we ordered lime juice to drink along with a chicken murtabak and mee goreng the murtabak is one of the more famous dishes from their menu the mee goreng not so famous the food arrived quickly courtesy of the super efficient staff the murtabak was every bit as good as we expected with a great curry to dip the entire extravaganza in the mee goreng was so so with the chicken a little over cooked like you see in chicken  the super efficient staff brought our bill and we paid and were gone within  mins wandering into the funky wonderment of haji lane and arab street we will definitely go back to zam zam for sure to have the murtabak again and perhaps the briyani which also seems to get excellent reviews the super efficient staff comments are actually meant as a compliment it is not elegant service but it is fast and accurate and actually of a standard you rarely see in singapore,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,a friend in singapore introduced me to this place it is awesome mutton murtabak is delicious great local crowd here too it is always packed but turns over fast and there is more room upstairs i have eaten here a bunch of times and always enjoyed it,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,great place for a nosh and sit murtabaks the size of a phone book air con on the nd floor,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,my nd visit i love this place if and when i leave sg this will be on my bucket list before flying out  words murtabak heaven,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,murtabak was a delight beef and chicken both fish curry sauce is essential to accent these flavors you may have to ask for it twice,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,century old shop yet entirely unassuming for  i had the most delicious indian food of my life admittedly this is not an area in which im expert but both the briyani and masala were seasoned and spiced perfectly for my taste,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,this is my go to place after getting a haircut from a nearby salon i am here not just because of the food but the memories and the history the place holds the place is usually filled with people there is always something going on do try the bryani or the murtabak,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,staff was rude to us for simply asking for tissue paper not specially worth a trip as far as taste,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,one of my favorite places for muslim food love their bryani it is not cheap though and it is often full house but it is worth going once in a while,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,stopped in at the recommendation of my barber right down the street fantastic selection of good indian food served up quick the fish curry was done extremely well the fish was fresh and tender pulling right off the bone beware of bones and the curry over rice was just right the pork murtabak was fried perfectly crispy on the outside soft and delicious on the inside definitely stop here if you get a chance,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,when i worked in the neighbourhood this was one of my favourite spots for lunch the prices are reasonable and you can get a delicious meal for just a couple of dollars my personal favourite is the masala dosai which is filled with chunky spiced vegetables and accompanied by a really good coconut chutney the briyani stand is worth a shot too and it does cost a little more than some other items but it is a very generous portion not much ambience to speak of but this is the kind of place where you have your fill and then move on anyways,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,me and couple of my buddies were in singapore for  days and decided to visit the arab street and try some saudi arabian cuisine although we had not heard much about zam zam right after checking out the sultan mosque as we passed this place some of the indian workers called out to us in native tongue and urged us to check this place out i have tried malabari cuisine in india as well surprisingly many excellent moslem hotels in india are named zam zam zam zam being the name of the well in mecca malabari is remotely derived from saudi arabian and tastes similar zam zam served both arabian and traditional singaporean dishes we decided to try out the murtabak saudi arabian dish paratha stuffed with fired onion cucumber tomato lamb beef chicken or deer since many workers were from south india they helped us with the best out of the menu and we ended up getting a beef lamb and deer murtabak with a biriyani and traditional sweet milk singaporean tea served with ice it tasted so good and rich that i salivated a bit now writing this sentence but beware it is basically super heavy food after having one murtabak you are expected to cross a desert we washed it down with the sweet milk tea which was not bad but murtabak is a must try here its been  year since i visited and it still fills my senses with its unique flavor when i think about it i have always wanted to eat one with grated coconut mixed with lamb in it probably next time when iam in calicut indiapros exxxcellent food say murtabak  quick service cheap a variety of choices it is basically arabia for your palate cons crowded irregular seating arrangement hot sweaty not the cleanest around a must try,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,heavenly murtabak take a walk down haji lane and wind up with dinner at zam zam makes a great breakfast lunch or dinner,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,great place went there for the first time tonight the murtabak is the best the service surprisingly was good as well,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,food was good and prices alright atmosphere is very anonymous however when you enter you are seated by one staff member another one takes your order another one brings your food and another one gives you the bill kinda felt like a mass processing cafeteria,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,watch out for tourist in the lion city scouting around bugis for good food and first restaurant that caught our eyes is the zam zam restaurant had a quick look in yelp before we decided our mind on this restaurant to satisfy the hunger of asian food especially the yummy roti prata since it is dinner time the only food you can order is murtabak or nasi biryani both are signature dishes of the restaurant we ordered murtabak with chicken filling  for a small one and a plate of nasi biryani rice with mutton   double yummy when the foods are served we could not wait for another min to dig in food delicious and there are two rooms upstairs with air conditioned so the dining experience is really great we going to come back here for breakfast before we leave,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,i am quite disappointed by the disclaimer in this restaurant it clearly says that all the murtabak are cooked in  pan and they are not responsible in case there is a mixture of meat so strict no no for people who do not eat beef,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,the food is nice and quite costly too and they do not take orders for prata only murtabak,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,located along the stretch of mosque street this place basically serves the working crowd around the vicinity the interior is normal just like any eatery stall it has two storeys and you might want to go to the second level as the air conditioning is much better up there they serve nice indian muslim cuisine food to try their chicken bryani the serving is big and the chicken is well coated with their home made gravy you can try the mutton bryani too but personally i prefer the chicken bryani as the mutton meat might be over cooked at times another dish to try would be the roti prata yes how can we miss this dish in an indian stall the plain prata is crispy and not too oily do request for the fish curry instead as it tastes much better than the original price is pretty affordable for the working crowd value for money,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,this is the place to go to for your murtabak cravings i prefer the chicken murtabak to the beef and mutton ones the restaurant uses large pieces of moist chicken leg in their chicken murtabak not the scrappy shreds in many neighbourhood stalls look out for chicken bones in your murtabak though lest you choke i have found a few small ones in mine before the dough is soft and chewy they are simply unbeatable crispy and soft inside with liberal amounts of filling their briyani tastes just as good each moist rice grain is heavily spiced and the meat comes totally smothered in rich gravy portions are damn huge the other dishes served are not as notable as their famous murtabak and briyani just stick to what they are good at,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,food is alright and the service is bad some of the waiters are rude would not visit the place ever again,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,chicken buryani do not let the simple looks deceive you flavors are out of this world,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,one of the best murtabak joints i have tried in singapore i cannot believe they have so many fillings beef mutton chicken and deer to go with the murtabak the murtabak pastry is just crisp and the meat is full of flavour best of all the curry that they give to go with the murtabak is thick and not watered down like many other popular places on a hot day i would recommend you finish the murtabak with a sirap limau or bandung perfection,Positive
zam-zam-restaurant,if you want to try the malay cuisine try this restaurant or its neighbor the new victory restaurant these are both places with a looong history going back to the beginning of the th century and both offer similar dishes like chicken or mutton murtabak a mixture of minced lamb egg and onion in a thin dough what is the name of that tunesian dough again very good i am told that the variation with sardines is also worth trying there is a local custard for dessert now do not expect a nice quiet dining experience people are queuing outside to get in tables are small it is noisy and smelly but you have to take this in your stride as part of the experience that is why i did not give  stars,Negative
zam-zam-restaurant,the chicken murtabak was nicely done the dough wrap was thin and fillings with garnishes of the right proportions eating it with the mild curry made for a delightful experience the briyani we ordered had the mutton curiously hidden within the basmati rice and the serving was large yet lightly flavourful i personally felt the rice could have been more fragrant the chilli chicken curry was thick but not too spicy the meat could have soaked more of the curry taste and overall it was just okay doused the curry dishes with servings of sweet but not too sweet teh chino the bill came up to  bucks for  would recommend this for one heavy supper,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,first off ordering was confusing once you get close to the front of the line they call you to order your dishes on the right side of the stall you got to pick your dish and what size you want now a sgd meal is regular size after you order the dish you get back in line i went to the back but the guy waved me over to get back in my original spot this was confusing and new people like me will be like wtf i might have done it wrong too the line was not too long when we arrived at am on a weekday you get the benefit of the drink stall next door to order drinks it is fun watching the chef create the dish at the front of the line i got the dry and soup noodles as for the soup noodles i did not get much flavor in the noodles i was questioning what was the hype but then after trying the broth i knew that was the key very flavorful and very thoughtful how they created this dish the dry noodle dish is good as well it has strong vinegar taste to it also the soup provided is on the sour side all very good i can see it getting hot eating here you are eating hot food after all prepare yourself with fans and cold drinks,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,simple delicious made with heart have you ever eaten at a michelin starred spot for  not only is singapore a dope vacation destination but it has cheap delicious food i do not read chinese and did not quite know if the menu was going to have any english so i chose what i wanted ahead of time bak chor mee with dry noodles omg this noodle dish is gooooood must be the black vinegar that makes it there are so many different flavors that go into this one dish it manages to incorporate all of the five basic tastes as well as other textures downside  long queue to order  im told the price went up with popularity upside  deliciousness  only takes only a few minutes to prepare is it worth it i think so recommend double the noodles and add the soup,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,they have a few outlets and we went to the one in upper cross street inside hong lim food center this is a well known establishment whereby the founders started the first stall in  their pork dumplings are simply delicious and my family always makes it a point to order an extra bowl to share on top of our s  bowl of minced pork noodle we have tried many stalls of such noodles and i dare say that tai hwa rates as one of the best in fact the original stall in hill street made it into the michelin  guide for singapore,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,hawker center food is on everyone is list when they go to singapore and we started our experience at tai hwa for lunch after waiting in the queue for almost an hour getting berated by the other stall owners for taking over what used to be a local establishment and feeling rather mediocre on the food from tai hwa i am not sure this is worth going out of your way for do i think it is a great value for the price paid yes absolutely would i go out of my way to come here probably not singapore has many fantastic places that allow you to stretch your dollars as far as you can but unless you are nearby to tai hwa i would opt for another place,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,we showed up on a monday and saw literally no one in line cause they were closed so we tried again the next day right at am before our flight out at noon thinking that we had plenty of time in between man we were wrong first off we did not know that we should have got there even earlier to claim one of the  tokens that will keep your first  spots before the line even started to form so although there were only about  people in front of us when we got in line it took them   hour total to go through those  tokens and the people in front of the line and at least  other to go orders which i think should have been taken care of only after those people who are actually waiting in person food we ordered  bak chor mee and they were tasty it is a shame that we had to inhale our food right away to leave for the airport and not so much enjoying it after the long wait overall i think i can go somewhere else for similar noodles without the wait and cheaper price tag not that  was expensive but singapore just offers so many options for cheap eat the verdict i am glad that i tried their noodles and it was honestly really good i can see why they got the michelin star however i would only go back if the wait is a lot shorter and definitely not before catching a flight in less than  hours,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,it is a great spot in singapore but i feel like it is jumped the shark a bit you will find the long lines but not of locals but of tourists i have had better pork noodles in singapore at a cheaper price and shorter wait yes the noodles stand out but i feel like the soup and ingredients were standard the fish cracklins were great though crunchy and flavorful it is a try if in the area but i would not go out of ones way to get a bowl,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,long lines for this place i was here mid day and there was still a steady lineup of  people or so people i ordered the bak chor mee after about  minutes standing in line they make  bowl at a time and some guy ordered  the noodles are tossed in a vinegar chilli oil and soy sauce mix which is then topped with what tasted like pork liver minced pork a couple of wontons a couple of meatballs and some additional meat slices there was also a dehydrated fried fish slice on top they tasted very different from noodles i have had in the past but definitely enjoyed it take some additional chilis to add to your bowl,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,since this was listed on the michellin guide i have to give it a try i planned an early dinner visit to avoid the long queues that people reported arrived at pm and there was a queue but tolerable waited  minutes for my food a good estimate of wait time is count the number of people in front of you multiply by  as each is likely ordering for  people then multiply by  again as it takes  mins to prepare a bowl of noodles so of people in front of you  average wait time is it worth waiting more than  mins i do not think so the bak chor mee minced pork noodles is ok nothing to scream about i had the  dry version with mee pok flat yellow egg noodles good presentation with a big bowl and generous with the meat sliced pork minced pork sliced liver gyoza and deep fried fish ti po a dash of lettuce and no braised mushrooms the black vinegar used for the sauce is flavorful which makes bak chor mee good there is a ji chai soup for  which in my mind is way over priced dried seaweed is put into the broth used for the soup version of bak chor mee can skip without missing anything a good dry version of bak chor mee needs to have mushroom sauce and nice vinegar this place missed out on the mushroom presentation wise tai hwa has it better than others the over sized bowl makes the noodles very appealing to the eye remember it still has a lot of carbs my suggestion is to go at off peak times order the  dry or soup version and if wait is longer than  mins come back another time,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,one of the cheapest michelin star food you can get the meat balls are super delicious some times you will have to q for an hour to order,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,noodle in general is good abit salty for me but still ok lar however queues up for   for a bowl of pork noodle maybe not as worth though u decide,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,famous michelin star bak chor mee stall in sg the noodle here is very flavorful strong flavors across sweet salty sour spicy which makes the bak chor mee standout they also give you a lot of sides to accompany the noodle sliced pork minced pork wonton meatballs liver noodle crisps everything taste excellent and a good balance to the noodle portion is big which probably explains the above average price would go back again if in the area however while this is a very good bak chor mee it is probably not good enough to warrant  hour wait during peak hours,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,this place gets  stars for the  hour wait it just might not be worth it i know i would not line up again the only incredible part of this is how slow the line moves the food is pretty good and would be on my  star list also has a michelin star if there was not a line the liver is extremely well done and tender the noodles are pretty good but does this make it significantly better than other bak chor mee places nah it is the best you will get but not worth the wait if you can go elsewhere i would try it once if there is almost no line and that is it people line up before they open so maybe consider getting there very early,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,you can write   yelp reviews while on queue i personally did not mind the wait and thoroughly enjoyed the noodles after  hr of waiting maybe i was just hungry i wish i had ordered a larger bowl after waiting for that long i am not sure if i would be back but it is definitely a place to try out at least once because if its michelin status,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,pretty solid place with some awesome flavours i had the dry noodles and it was really awesome to get so many different pork meat varities in different forms the sauce is a bit spicy and the soup delicious not something i would wait for but worth a one time visit,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,now that it has received a michelin star there are more tourists joining the queue for some bak chor mee we went at pm on a friday and it still took about  minutes to wait in line for the food there were about  people ahead of me but we saw there were only  people in line at pm hard to find the sweet spot on when the wait will be shortest the queue system is neater now halfway through the wait maybe   people ahead of you you will be asked to place your order on the right side and then go back to your queue spot to wait the noodle tasted better when eaten at the coffee shop i ordered the  bowl as recommended by other yelpers and it definitely had more ingredients than what i previously remembered i would have skipped the meatball soup if i knew there were more  meatballs in the  portion i ended up with too many meatballs as the soup came with  meatballs for  it was soft but a bit on the salty side i still gave it a  stars because of the queue system not everyone can stand for that long i rather you order it and then get a number or buzzer and wait,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,michelin stars the dish is delicious let is get that right out of the way so much so that i have spent some time now at home replicating the magic that is tai hwa pork noodle obviously my homemade version is not as good but with some tweaks i think it could be a passable substitute here is where the wheels fall off the wagon it is cheap and has a lot of fan fare because of the single star it is received on our first attempt we waited for about   hours and only moved  tiles we used the tiles on the floor to determine how far we had to go which was not much we gave up we returned the next morning  minutes before opening and received number  if you guys are missing a number  i might know why it was another hour wait before we got our food this time we were determined which was delicious as i have mentioned the whole ordeal of waiting in the heat of singaporean weather was just lost on me yes the food was delicious yes it was cheap but for a michelin star you have to do something above and beyond i feel like with the thousands of hawker stalls all over singapore you could more places similar to this with delicious food and less of the brouhaha it is the challenge that yelp and michelin diners face seek these places out find the undiscovered gems in areas that people may not frequent blaze the trail for others to follow do not just let your choice of place be governed by these yelp ratings which are always way too subjective you might find something you really like a diamond in the rough,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,line may seem long but only because the chef takes so long to make each bowl i personally waited almost two hours and the dish was not exceptional or anything i had not tasted before many other better options nearby but significantly less wait,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,as i was on a michelin food hunt that day after eating the soy sauce chicken in chinatown i immediately headed over to this noodle place for lunch unlike the other stall they do not really advertise their michelin star and the only way you will know about it is a small plaque at the very front of the line i got there at lunch time and it was a little over an hour wait be warned that it can get quite hot and humid while waiting as there was only one fan aimed at the queue whilst lining up i noticed there were signs for a    and  noodle asking around people said that they were simply denoting the size of noodles but after receiving my order that is not quite the case ordering was a bit daunting but somehow i managed to communicate for a  dry non spicy bak chor mee watching him prepare your bowl of noodle was quite confusing he was dipping meats and noodles and sauces into different bowls before dumping them all into one then after handling the raw meats with his bare hands he will handle your cash payment when i got my order i noticed my soup was lacking the seaweed that i had seen in the pictures and inquired why they simply stated it was because i ordered the  version the full version was at  so i found out the hard way the pricing did not dictate size alone the noodle came with some minced pork some liver a meatball a wonton and some crunchy meat that i could not identify texturally the dish was very interesting with bites alternating between crunchy and soft as you ate in terms of the flavor profile it really was not for me the vinegar was simply too overpowering and i do not really get the hype with this dish the side bowl of soup was also quite bland nothing really special if you are a fan of sour and spicy it might be worth it to give it a try despite the wait but for people that have a penchant for more savory flavors give this place a pass,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,one word amazing we went on a tuesday morning thinking it would not be packed but when we got to the store at around   there was already roughly  people in line after roughly  hours in the brutal heat and watching countless happy customers bypass us with their freshly cooked noodles we finally got our orders in and let me say this the wait was totally worth it the noodles were hand pulled very flavourful after soaking up the vinegary soup base there was a wide selection of minced pork liver sliced pork wontons and crispy fish on the side of the bowl plus you could add freshly chopped chili peppers on top to enhance the flavours the combination of all the toppings was like heaven in a bite crunchy savoury sour and spicy definitely cant go wrong with a meal this good especially with the pricing being  for medium,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,i got to tai hwa  minutes after opening and waited in line  hour  minutes i appreciated that each batch of meat was cooked to order for just the right amount of time ensuring tender pork and liver the noodles were springy and the sauce punchy and well balanced while i definitely enjoyed my noodles it was not amongst my favorites in singapore if i lived in the neighborhood i would visit again otherwise i am sure places with equally delicious noodles and a shorter wait exist just have to be in the know i guess,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,michelin  star  coffee shop stall with   hr long queue arrived  am with over  hr wait in line in hot humidity each bowl is freshly individually prepared average   min per customer depending on bowls order at    recommend  bowl better value tasty noodles in chili and vinegar sauce with pork balls mince pork liver wanton good noodles but not worth  hr wait and price of michelin cuisines tasted in france germany italy usa am not sure how this one star was awarded at best only bib gourmand in my view not worth long wait come off peak hours if curious to try many other good bak chor noodles elsewhere with better queues and price,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,one of the two hawker food stalls awarded a michelin star the line can be long and it does take a while to get your food but just know that it is because it is a popular spot also they make the noodles one bowl at a time two noodles options with soup or dry both noodles have a mix of pork meat and organs and wontons we got one of each and i would say the dry one bak chor mee is the more flavorful one a mix of chili soy sauce vinegar on the bottom freshly cooked noodles on top then the meats and wontons four sizes available   regular,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,so good period i have never had this type of pork noodles before and i am glad i got to try it we got there around  on saturday and there were about  people ahead of us we ended up ordering   hours later everyone says to order bak chor mee but it does not say it anywhere on the menu i am assuming it is number  gan mian and they say mee pok id also the same thing i ordered bak chor mee regular size dry with chili you can watch the crew make your food right in front of you like a fine oiled machine i will go home thinking about this bowl of noodles the salty sweet sour flavors of the noodles are perfectly balanced it comes with a small bowl of seaweed soup others ordered some kind of meatball soup to go with the noodles i do not think i would wait   hours again for this  michelin start rated food but the next  times i go i would plan to go when it is not as busy,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,chef is like a mad scientist best noodle dish i have ever had and worth the  min wait i want to go back to singapore just to eat there,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,first saw pics of the noodles from tai hwa on instagram and knew this would be one of my first stops during our singapore trip after reading a few reviews i knew to avoid this place during peak times so we ended up coming for a late lunch on a monday for some reason the taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong location not far but ended up walking a few blocks i was glad to have google maps open so that we could find this place we arrived to find a short line and waited about  mins before placing our order for those that do not speak mandarin i am not sure how successful you will be ordering food here as the guy who took our order did not speak cantonese and spoke very very little english it took a total of  minutes before we sat down to eat i ended up with a  bak chor mee bowl of noodles and it definitely lived up to the hype i would definitely wait an hour for a bowl of their dry bak chor mee noodles in a heartbeat a definite must try when coming to singapore,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,the queue was pretty short when i dropped by it was just a  minutes wait maybe because the regulars knew that the staffs were going for  minutes lunch break soon at  pm i was lucky to be the second last order to be made before the break orders that cannot be completed by  pm would be given a queue number the serving looked a tab small for s  and served with a bowl of seaweed soup i was not full after finishing it and seem to be lacking of the wow factor the sauce was a tab bland although not too vinegary like that the pig is liver was cooked just right tender there is lots of pieces of crispy flat fish in it,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,i am not sure what the hype is but it is basically a pork noodle bowl bak chor mee with minced pork sliced pork liver meatballs wontons and salted fish it was pretty good tasting but i felt it had way too much going on in it maybe i prefer the simpler dishes i had grown accustomed to during my stay here but i would say it is not worth going out of your way for if you absolutely must go it is probably best to go during the daytime here,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,whilst making my research on a trip to singapore this food stall caught my eye being rated  star in michelin guide  for singapore also being ranked no  in the world street food masters list  i went to the shop at around   a m on a wednesday the location is not quite easy to find as it is kind of hidden at the ground floor eatery of an apartment when i got there the queue was about reaching the metal rollers of the shop and it takes about   mins before it is my turn to place my order having ordered the medium portion and collected the food i am amazed by that presentation of food in a rather huge bowl it is really big taste wise it is rather obvious that vinegar plays a big role in the sauce the pork is cooked to perfection tender and juicy the soup broth served together with seaweed has a strong taste too it feels like it has been cooked for long hours i have also ordered an extra bowl of meatballs which tastes really good too however so it is rather regrettable where whilst the food being one so spectacular it does not really stay in my taste buds it just does not make me feel like i will come back one day note closed on st and rd monday of the month queue can get rather long by the time i have finished my food at about   a m it is safe to say that the queue has doubled although it is a wednesday morning happy chef western food serves pretty decent chicken chop too do give it a try direction take the exit from lavender station east west mrt line turn left and walk to the back of immigration and checkpoint authority building cross the bridge into the residential areas apartments and look for block  visited  oct  food ordered pork noodle medium portion sgd   add on meatball soup sgd   considering the portion it feels like it is a little overpriced but having awarded with a michelin star worth it,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,overrated is it significantly better than your average bak chor mee yes is a tiny handful of noodles in a deceptively large bowl good enough to be worth  and    hours of your time no say an hour of your time is worth only  would you pay   for this bowl of noodles if it meant no queueing up if not then what are you doing here,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,i think most westerners need to be careful with this michelin star as it is not for many taste palates it is definitely worth a try but i spoke to many foreigners who did not like the dish i arrived at   on a weekday and there was practically no line queue i ordered the  bowl and watched the magic happen with the food i agree the noodles are extra springy with a beautiful texture otherwise even for me the liver was a bit strong for my taste i still finished my portion fairly quickly and was still hungry so got myself another order if you can do so come between the peak hours and just try it out,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,hour wait for this one michelin star bak chor mee noodles pretty good time if you ask me this was literally the best thing i ate in singapore we only came here by chance to try one of the michelin star hawker stalls and this was most convenient to us it was the first time i inhaled my food on this trip i was only there for  days and i have lived in hong kong for a while so the chinese styled food did not wow me but this did now i did not have much expectation for it since it did not look that appealing but the taste was amazing the flat noodles we got had a chewy consistency al dente which is how i like mine the sauce was what made it amazing now i do not typically like my noodles in soup since it makes the noodles soft and soggy this sauce was spectacular it had a vinegary taste which some people may not like and perfectly salted not too strong either the condiments on top were what differentiated this from just noodles my mouth is watering as i am writing this the generous slices of liver that melt in your mouth is how they got me i have never had liver so perfectly cooked before and i have never liked it due to its chewiness and grainy texture but this was was just melt in your mouth liver and it was so good comes with a cup of liver seaweed soup it is so good reminds me of my momma is soup but taste so much better i do not know if you can tell but i love this place everything was cooked so fast too the line was definitely not appealing but it moves fast so i was quite happy they were efficient with cooking and they made everything right in front of you so it was impressive need drinks too you can go right next to it get some coffee or lemon honey they make it right in front of you the location may not be the most gorgeous but its the food that matters would defos come back if i were in singapore again,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,well it is good but to come specially for this place there are so many good eating places in singapore so again i enjoyed my dish but unless you really coming around   when the q is quit short i would not bother,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,lured by a shining michelin star we queued up behind  minutes of other patrons in short this joint has a lot of hype it admirably tries to fulfill that hype but at the end of the day it is a mom and pop spot serving authentic cultural noodle dishes on a thin margin in long flavors of their noodle dishes are indeed complex but almost to a fault the dry egg noodle dish is very sour with vinegar the liver assaults your taste buds with iron and minerals the dumplings are nearly all wrapping skin and what seafood is in them is all but lost the soupy rice noodle is a bit better but the noodles lack al dente texture the sliced pork is both tough and sans flavor the ground pork is again tough and relatively bland the fried fish chip is an interesting flare and provides a bit of seafood complexity to the dish as does seaweed slivers singapore is an immaculate city but an interesting practice occurred at this joint the noodle prep man filled noodles into each of our bowls but then he stacked our two noodle dishes together such that the dirty side of one dish was on top of the noodles of our other dish after the top dish touched the soiled countertop it defied logic why he would place the dish on top of the other bowl is noodles but hey what do i know in sum certainly worth a try but not all that glitters with michelin stars is gold,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,dear sweet fanciful moses this was the best bowl of noodles i have ever had i normally like the toppings better than noodles in noodle dishes because i am not a huge carbs person but i ate an entire large bowl of these they are perfectly fresh al dente goodness with theeee best flavor to them i also usually shy away from liver but this tasted less livery lol sorry for the lame description much foodie the dried fish bits were my favorite sounds gross but yum i could have eaten a bag of those like chips on their own i got in line at   am on a sunday and still waited  minutes in a line of mayyyybe  people they really take their time and make each bowl perfectly i would honestly queue up for that long again it was completely worth it i am sure it is only going to get busier as they have been awarded a michelin star so go early to avoid sweating your ass off in a line all day go for the large  bowl i do not have a huge appetite and i still finished the large bowl fine if you are gonna queue for that long go big or go home went great with a   iced lemon tea from the stall right next to it,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,mee is worthythe results are in and all the culinary buzz in singapore has been filled with nothing but the official singapore michelin guide about who is worthy and who is not i do not normally intentionally queue just to try out the latest recommendations but since we were in leave on thursday a friend of ours had suggested heading over to eat the newly crowned  michelin star hill street tai hwa pork noodles she is been a regular customer there years before all the hype started but has recently avoided it a bit due to the crazy crowds since the stalls inauguration while walking over we were crossing our fingers as her friend who has ate there the day before waited an hour during lunch and we were hoping that we would have better luck at   in the afternoon i love my minced pork noodles the gf knows i have his obsession with it and she could see the excitement in me knowing that i was not only finally going to satisfy my craving for minced pork noodles but was going to try what is apparently the best minced pork noodles in singapore now when we got there there were about   people in the queue but seeing how fast the owner was churning out each bowl we decided to queue thank goodness the speed of his cooking is generally fast with us only waiting for  mins not too bad considering we had   people ahead of us with some ordering  to  bowls a first glance at the price kind of shocked me    and  that had to be the most expensive minced pork noodles i have come across but once we ordered i could understand why unlike other minced pork noodles tai hwa was very generous with their ingredients a good serving on minced pork lots of liver sliced pork crispy fried fish bian yu  meatballs and  large dumplings it certainly was value for the  which is their regular size while i went with the traditional mee pok flat noodles with chilli the gf who does not take chilli went with the mee kia thin noodles with no chilli first words of advice go with the chilli or just a little bit of you are not a chilli eater the key of any dry noodle dish to me is the sauce it comes with and while the non chilli dish was still fairly tasty the star of the dish had to be the chilli sauce used and the vinegar there is no vinegar on the non chilli versions although you may add it in yourself on the side firstly the sauce it was full of flavour without being overly salty it had a lot of depth and vinegar was not only fragrant but it added a lot of soul into the dish i cannot quite pin point exactly what made the vinegar so special but it definitely was not any regular black vinegar that was used the noodles the noodles itself was wonderfully cooked perfectly al dante the noodles managed to soak up the delicious sauce yet remain springy and crisp the ingredients while the meatballs were pretty standard the rest of the items were immaculately cooked the minced pork had a great fat to meat ratio the dumplings were very tasty and the liver the liver was cooked perfectly lightly blanched the liver was still soft and tender retaining some pinkish ness a wonderful contrast to the normal hard overcooked and powdery livers a lot of other places offer the soupif you are not a fan of the dried versions that the soup is worth having a try too the soup is to die for even though it was just a little side bowl the fact that it was chalky showed how much pork has been cooked in it and it tasted like it too definitely the best soup from a noodle shop i have had so the big question is are they worthy of that michelin star yes i am not shy to say this but this has certainly been the best mince pork noodle i have had and i will be happy to queue again to have another round of it as long as the queue is not anything more that  mins,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,woot michelin star food for  here is a tip if you go at am you can get a number and have your spot saved in line then come back at   when they open and wait for your number to be called i had number  and my number was not called till almost  the stand also primarily speak in chinese i got the bak chor mee and the soup base is really the most awesome part of the dish the dish is spicy tangy so definitely more of an acquired taste for some people,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,this changes your expectations of a michelin star meal firstly you have to be ok waiting for  minutes in line the noodles were good made of all different forms of pork but my favorites was still the basic meatballs if you look at this as a bowl of noodles in isolation it was ok what made it special was the effort the noodles seemed to take juxtaposed with the price,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,the michelin star was not awarded for the late afternoon one hour wait or shabby looking exterior endure the wait though and you will get an incredible bowl of pork noodles i asked for  dry and it was phenomenal the noodles were perfectly cooked supplemented by a refreshing soup if you can endure the wait bring water you will be rewarded,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,meh i thought the noodle was very mediocre and missed any flavor not worth it for me,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,my friends and i pretty much ordered their entire menu the wet style noodles were simple flavorful pork base broth look funn this same soup was used in the seaweed soup and the meatball soup the dry style noodles had some spicy vinegar mixture with yellow flat noodles the dry style mixture was not overpowering amd it was well controlled out of all the dishes my favorite was the meatballs because the juice of the meat seemingly burst as you bite into it the pork flavors fills your palates as it travels the only thing is the line is terrible i personally would not stand in line again,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,i am of chiu chow descent so trust me when i tell you i love love love bak chor mee we came here right before it opened to get a number tag for the cue we made it about  mins before they opened and got  the whole wait time was about   mins definitely get there before they open because the line goes out the door the moment the store actually is open for orders once the restaurant opens they take the numbers first and then everyone else in the line it was our last meal in singapore so we definitely went all out instead of one  bowl we both got two  bowls which meant more food for the price it is pricier than other hawker stands and other restaurants that serve it you can taste the difference and it tastes good i can see why they got a michelin star the bowls are small though the people there speak little english and mostly mandarin ordering was easy though because there are not too many choices the bak chor mee dry is definitely the way to go it is vinegary but not overpowering and the noodles are a perfect texture i hate soggy noodles so this was a big deal to me there is not a lot of meat but most dishes do not come with a lot of meat in south east asia we also got the meatball soup yummy i would definitely come back as long as i could avoid the lines definitely go a little earlier even if it is like  minutes the line gets long fast,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,do not need much review this place has enough five stars the first michelle star pork noodle in the world so proud that our singapore hawker food made it to the michelle star remains as my top choice if i have the time to queue,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,i am definitely a fan of the food but not the line for it unfortunately it has gotten even more popular with the michelin star hence it was one hour and forty minutes line up time for my friends perhaps they can open up a second store somewhere else as i seriously want to go back and have this soon x x,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,we had the bak chor mee nice,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,review for nov queue is long about hr during the lunch hour but would definitely come here came with a friend and had both variants of the noodles and it was definitely worth the wait and would come back again,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,not quite sure that this hawker stand lived up to the  michelin star hype in my book me and justin b showed up on a tuesday afternoon around pm hoping to catch the in between lunch dinner lull but i guess everyone else had the same idea b c the line was at least   people deep when we showed up the line moves so slow and its kind of a bummer there is no limit to the amount of food that  person can order so you may see a single person ahead of you that buys like  bowls of food and with the hot humid singapore weather and only a few fans in the area to cool you down waiting in line is not a fun experience haha the only redeeming thing is that there is a drink stand next door where you can get a cold soda to help cool down or order food from the other stalls to satisfy your hunger pains haha we ended up waiting  hours for our bowl of food upon first bite of the bak chor mee i wasnt immediately wow ed the whole sweet sour tangy flavor combination isnt my favorite but as i continued to eat my bowl of noodles pork dumplings and fish balls grew on me and i liked the flavors more and more with each bite i think we ordered the  sgd bowl which is about ish usd and for that price point its still a great deal and value i had never had bak chor mee before this experience and i am glad i got to experience this dish while in singapore but i cannot justify this  hour wait,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,singapore is never short of cheap and good food but when it comes to having awesome nosh singaporeans will need to scour every single nook and crany for the best when you feel like chowing down on a good bowl of pork noodle bak chor mee as we would call it please come here the queue during lunch might be a little daunting so try to come down during off peak hours but even during off peak one can expect to wait for about  to  minutes to see the front of the queue so do not come famished but almost hungry remember the soup nazi from seinfeld well we do have an experience with the whole ordering process you will have to order in a particular sequence price of the bowl you want type of noodle dry or soup and then all the misc special request less spicy more vinegar no liver etc if in a group please remember to order per bowl so do not go like  bowls of  mee pok no chill you will be left ignored when your bowl is presented to you you will be glad you actually waited the noodles are cooked perfectly with all the quality ingredients one will want in a bowl of bak chor mee you have the minced pork the liver slices the singluar meatball that lonely piece of vegetable mixed in a crazy sauce that one will relish till the very last drop mix them all up and slowly enjoy the goodness in every bite the accompanying soup is also really flavourful and one can only wonder how their wonton soup will taste like till the next time i go back so to have some authentic pork noodle come down here and get an awesome bowl or two please invite me along the next time anyone is going down and i will be glad to join you in enjoying an awesome bowl of bak chor mee,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,china style noodles definitely order a large bowl you have to wait a long time so might as well eat more,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,so this place received a gazillion accolades michelin star being one among them expect lineups at pm as well you have  dishes to choose from but overall did not care too much for mine just walked away from mine after eating  rds of it but at these provrsx  and under worth the try if line up is not too long,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,had a similar pork noodle  years ago when i was in singapore and thought wanna try one this time during my formula one visit friend recommended to me this michelin one star rated noodle shop expected to wait for an hour but guess what we have waited for  full hours for this noodles the noodle itself was very good but definitely i will never wait this long again for this,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,like others before me have said if you can get past waiting in line for  mins on average and upwards of hr during peak hours and days then you are in for a real treat i ordered the much talked about pork noodles with the broth on the side and it was absolutely delicious while i have had noodles of this style elsewhere i have never tried it with the unique vinegar sauce mixture that the chef so craftily pours over the fresh noodles which are made on site all in all this is a great example of a local gem,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,its a one michelin star place went there with high expectations the line was not too bad as compared to the previous two famous carts i would been to i just did not like the noodles the texture and taste is something i just did not enjoy that being said you should still give it a try i am pretty sure most people standing in line really enjoyed it,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,definitely one of the best mee pok i have tasted in singapore nice chewy al dented style of egg noodles mixed in with pork lard soy sauce and chilli definitely worth a bite if you have the time to stand in line for at least  minutes,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,favorite fan of bak chor mee forever heard about this no  bc mee and it is snaking queue hence tried it today ordered a   after queueing for mins extremely disappointed noodles is thick and not so springy ingredients are fresh base sauce is so so overall not really worth the price and time doubtful will come and queue again advice to owner is that he should concentrate on cooking instead of also being the cashier hence undercooked noodles,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,amazing i was taken here not knowing what bak chor mee even was nor what awaited me my delicate californian constitution could not handle the heat and  hour  min wait in line to get my food but damn was all that worth it it helped that i waited in line with  lovely ladies this bak chor mee was delicious chilli vinegar and perfectly qq noodles did not really care about the wonton but the pork and liver were delicious although i wish there were more i cannot really compare to other bak chor mee since i am a novice but i know good food and this was good food,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,if you like waiting in line and paying a lot of money for hawker food this is the place for you if you do not like waiting in line and paying a lot of money for hawker food this is still the place for you whenever i am away from singapore i have dreams about this bowl of goodness haters can nitpick all they want but imma let you finish but this is the best bak chor mee of all time,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,queued for approximately an hour and a half a week after the michelin announcement i came with a huge expectation and to be perfectly honest was left pretty disappointed by the dish although the noodle base was undoubtedly unique i found the noodle and other ingredients very normal and forgettable then again i do admit that i have never been a fan of bak chor mee this stall barely deserves its one star due to its incredible noodle base however i will probably not come back anytime soon,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,i have not had vinegary mee pok before there i said it what is with the judgey looks people geez so i embarked upon a mee pok trail and this was one of those die die must tries we got there slightly before am and a wild queue of   people greets us curses still we duly wait as dining companion really likes her mee pok fast forward about mins later it is finally our turn and we both end up with mee kia as it turns out while she likes mee pok the mee pok noodles here are too doughy for her liking and it is true even the mee kia seems pudgier than those elsewhere and these upsized strands have a less qq bite than i would prefer sad vinegar hit is ok neither too subtle nor overpowering the chilli leans towards the mild side and the ingredients are mostly meaty stuff one wanton one meat ball some minced pork pork slices and liver a bit measly really you know the episode where karl pilkington goes to china and when he treks the wall and goes it is not a great wall it is an alright wall it is the alright wall of china yup for me it is just an alright bowl of noodles plus the ridiculous wait i think not,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,according to teochew ah pa the price has gone up with inflation now the smallest bowl is  and we ordered  bowls of dry bcm  mee kia and  mee pok the queue is of course very long as always alas the much awaited bcm came up and yes it was the same old taste that we have had previously it does not hold back on vinegar and seasonings and thus give a satisfying kick which lures you back for more no pork lard but crispy pieces of flatfish still works for us my family love our bcm the spicy way but their plain version is equally competent you can self service to more vinegar if you like that said we noted a problem this time round too much sodium in the wanton dumplings and also noodles i did not remember the food being so heavily seasoned the last time or my memory must be failing but it could also be this distinctive taste or that keeps the business going so well after many years indeed we got thirsty hours after the meal but well once in a blue moon bowl of comforting and satisfying bak chor mee wo not hurt too much,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,as a tourist from the us who generally likes asian noodle dishes i was intrigued by the favorable reviews of this eatery and as it was with in walking distance from my hotel i decided to track down this establishment what i found was a small hawker stall just off north bridge road about a   mile ne of raffles that in the middle of the afternoon had a queue no other stall i passed along the way had anyone waiting that time of day the queue was a very promising sign it was fortunate that i had written down bak chor mee even though i had no idea what this means beyond being a noodle dish i was being adventuresome because there is no menu anywhere and the brusque but hard working staff does not seem to understand much english upon my placing the order phonetically the man asked me a question i did not understand i guessed that he wanted to know if i wanted chili sauce on my noodles i nodded my bowl of noodles indeed came with the chili sauce and was garnished with several types of pork shredded sliced and some pieces of liver together with few other items i could not identify i was extremely pleased with the noodles which were very tasty although i might have backed off a little on the chili sauce as a personal preference just for reference i like my salsas between mild and medium a bowl of soup accompanied the noodles a flavorful seaweed both that had a little aftertaste of liver overall the very savory noodles made tracking down this little hawker stall well worthwhile,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,each time i think of bak chor mee i dutifully make my way down to this stall to get my fix springy noodles cooked al dente style chinese version with lots of tasty tiiny meat chunks meat balls salted fish tossed in a delicious blend of vinegar chilli soya sauce and oil there is liver too but i always opt out of that best ever not two thumbs up but  fingers up,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,a really unassuming establishment until you see how popular it is by the line that forms tai hwa is not a popular hawker center like newton is or maxwell is but it is really a gem when i first got my bowl i was thinking this is it for  but it really is a small bowl of quality goodness every single item is thoughtfully crafted and placed as an integral part of a whole their preparation is arguably inefficient however you wo not argue any longer once you eat it always get the pork noodles dry it sits in a small pool of vinegar based sauce and the noodles are fresh as in they are handmade at least that is what it seems and cooked upon order topping the noodles are a mixture of minced pork liver dry fried fish etc you get a bowl of soup on the side as well i saw some other people with bigger portions so you can probably get there for extra if you are feeling hungrier or want more goodness,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,when my wife asked me why i did not heed the harvard healthy eating plate recommendation to limit refined grains i answered it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every bowl of bak chor mee that comes from the coffee shop on crawford lane i had to put it down in writing on yelp before i could order my extra large bowl of bak chor mee,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,a lot of newspapers articles etc about this place one ridiculous article i found was posted right in front of the cashier which says about two men fighting due to the queuing and police came to reconcile waited for  mins they normally had one lady take your order first and then the old man cooking he used many bowls by putting some little meat soup in every bowl and then dump to another place he never ended up using that same bowl for serving i really had no idea what he was doing all the meat like pork and pork liver were raw he basically just put the soup in it so it cooked by itself the noodles are quite normal the soup bowl on the side was very fatty and oily the flavor is just vinegar plus spicy sauce i do not see why it is so famous or special,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,it must be a good day for me as i did not have to q for a long time i think the noodle used to be better now it is simply too overrated i have tasted better and hope tai hwa will return to the standard it used to have when it was at hill street,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,i am not a fan of bak chor mee and i find the bak chor mee here average but people who love it are queuing an average of   minutes for the food from own experience of queuing i deduced that the wait is long and the queue is slow because the person preparing the the food seem slow further observing the preparation prove i am right but that is because they treat their food seriously even though i am not their fan i have friends around me who are and they make it a point to go all the way to larvender mrt to have it those who are interested can try for themselves and they are open most of the days from  am to pm except st and rd monday of each month,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,the best minced pork noodle in singapore the noodle is cooked just al dente most other hawkers in singapore tend to over cook their noodles but not this chap the morsels of meat are also cooked just right tender juicy and succulent this just shows to me that a lot of attention to detail has gone into cooking that bowl of noodle expensive for a bowl of hawker noodle but well worth the price the only pet peeve i have for this place is the long wait budget for at least an hour of queuing is it worth the wait hmm the jury is still out as i really dislike having to stand in line and wait for my food but if you want to try the best bak chor mee in singapore this is the place,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,nothing else is comparable to the noodles here this is evidenced by the long lines every day and i do mean every day we were there at  am on a wednesday and there is a line of  persons once we joined the line  more were behind us immediately tip morning is cooked by the boss himself lunch hour his sous chef dinner another worker i only go when it is either the boss himself or the sous chef it is all in the number of nano seconds the noodle is cooked yes technicalities of asian hawker food,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,tiny hawker stand with only three items on their menu heard the line can get crazy we went around  hoping no one would be there but still had to wait about   mins not bad they have a dry noodle a soup noodle and a beef ball soup my husband got the dry noodle and i got the soup noodle it is interesting how you pick a size by amount and not small medium or large every stands in line on the left where you pick up food and the guy will call you up to the right side to place your order my husband loved his dry noodle my soup noodle was just so so dry noodle definitely tasted a lot better i would never wait an hour for the soup noodle,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,totally worth the wait and everytime i have been here there will definitely be a wait the crispy fried flatfish is what makes all tw difference for this bcm order a bowl of too soft but nonetheless tasty dumpling soup to round off your meal after all that waiting,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,first things first the queue is very long and it is not those fast moving queue so you do need quite a bit of patience if you want to get a taste of this bar chor mee my friend told me that the would ry one is what people think is the better one so i tried it but in my humble opinion the soup one actually taste better overall nothing very spectacular in my opinion so i am not very sure if i will come back especially with such a long queue,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,this stall was previously located in marina sq food court and always has a long queue for the bak chor mee even foreigners that come here want to try the noodles before they return to their countries the special feature is the chilli sauce and the flavourful soup their pig is liver is also done very nicely cooked for just the right amount of time resulting is tender slices of liver heaven i was sort of shocked when i saw that the whole bowl was filled with oil but i was told that this is actually the yardstick for all bak chor mees in singapore anyway i was not disappointed with the taste not too salty and very flavourful with just a highlight of sourness coming from the vinegar i also liked the fried bits of lard and the liver bits which was not too overpowering and given in the correct amount the crispy fish was also a nice addition to the usual bak chor mee dish a must try,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,i have lived away for some  years and every time i come backto singapore which is about twice a year i head straight here the morning after my arrival for my fav authentic hawker food each time the noodles do not disappoint the secret is in the mix the sacue is sufficiently vinegary and sweet and sallty the ingredients are fresh and of good quality and the noodles are always cooked just right what really seals the deal for me is the stock which is amazing over the years the prices have escalated so that my visit each time runs up a bill close to  for two persons eating there and a to go order for three at home notwithstanding the prohibitive cost i return my one complaint right now is that for to go orders they do not offer you the soup sp you have to purchase a soup bowl to go,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,i would known before making my way down to lavender that hill street tai hwa pork noodles was a popular bak chor mee stall with some food bloggers going so far as to claim that it was the best bak chor mee stall in singapore i was all ready to give it the benefit of the doubt seeing as how it was a family run stall dating back to  despite the knowledge of all these facts its snaking queue on a wednesday evening managed to surprise me anyway and contributed to the already high expectations that i would had of the noodles here um sadly was not impressed i kind of get why hill street tai hwa pork noodles has its loyal following the gravy here has a much higher ratio of vinegar than most bak chor mees do which i suppose goes down well with those who like their noodles with an acidic kick the fragrant and crisp pieces of ti por or fried solefish provided a nice crunch that provided a pleasant contrast with the springy mee kia thin noodles and the pork used here in all its forms minced sliced livers and balls is fresh chewy and of good quality oh the one thing that i liked about the bak chor mee here was the broth that came with it i could literally see a meat cloud in it which was a precursor to how intensely meaty and flavorful it tasted i am going to go all out blasphemous and say that i do not get the hype about the bak chor mee here at all this was okay bak chor mee yes but to call it the best bak chor mee in singapore when i cannot even decide if i prefer it to the ones sold by the hawkers in my neighbourhood nahhh i will take convenience any day just a note of caution if you are thinking of heading here for bak chor mee they are supposed to close at  pm but their actual closing time is when they run out of ingredients for the day which on the day i visited was   pm,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,this is so underwhelming i cannot believe i queued  minutes for this during lunch time it was time to see what is the fuss about when i decided to join the snaking queue in this coffeeshop tucked away in a sleepy estate of crawford lane all i can say is i do not see what is so special about it add in the waiting time and i feel cheated the noodles were quite stiff and starchy and there was so much sole fish in it and too little minced pork i had a better time with the homemade iced lemon tea from the same coffeeshop be sure to order that if you need to try the noodles,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,delicious minced meat noodles but on the pricey side starts from  to  a bowl not sure what lies in the  bowl but taste wise it hits the bcm spot all the time long queues expected but moderately fast,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,the best minced pork noodle i have ever had other minced pork noodles no longer satisfy my cravings anymore since i have had this many years ago today the noodles still taste as good as it was in the past love the fried flatfish and the wanton that comes with it,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,hands down the best bak chor mee in singapore when it comes to flavor and freshness tai hwa is hard to beat some people prefer their bak chor mee to incorporate tomato based sauce but my tastes are more aligned to the vinegar chili heavy mix that tai hwa cooks up the wontons liver meatballs and dried salted fish give the extra oomph that make the noodles truly a complete dish,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,fave bcm in town but be prepared to queue for this usually it will take me around   mins depending on the length of the queue and how many orders per person,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,not sure what else i can say other than that this is most definitely the best bak chor mee in singapore once you can get past the queue in this little kopitiam you will finally find yourself holding onto a bowl of the most perfectly cooked noodles doused in a casually good vinegar base one of the best parts of this is how well cooked their minced and sliced pork is soo tender and juicy considering how fine they are the pork balls are also very tasty without having that artificial flavour to it and to crown it off they add some bits of crispy deep fried dried fish which adds that bit of crunch and saltiness to the whole bowl one wonders why this does not feature in more minced pork noodles sold everywhere because it makes such a good combination the soup on the side is so well brewed as well you can actually taste the pork from which the flavour comes from none of that artificial flavouring that we frown upon i do not think,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,i accidentally found this place i had a pork noodle the portion of food is quite too big for a girl like me the taste is unique and delicious love it,Positive
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,be prepared to queue it is worth it is there a better pork noodle out there nope there never will be,Negative
tai-hwa-pork-noodle,hands down the best bak chor mee in singapore i love the vinegar with the chilli and so much porky goodness in the soup super long queue so make sure you bring some entertainment wait times can be up to one hour at peak times,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,well yelp never lets me down came to vatos for dinner after needing a break from hawker stalls so i browsed yelp and that is where we ended up my bf and i shared  orders of two tacos each the beef brisket pork belly and fish tacos they were all very delicious and although the taco tortilla appeared small they were stacked to the sky with protein it is not a very traditional mexican place because those places usually do two tortillas per taco but i enjoyed these tacos thoroughly and i would come back if i ever visited singapore again,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,this place is stashed away in the dip but conveniently located in the beach road complex which is a beautiful creation and area to stay and play in we were greeted promptly and seated promptly the menu was easy to read and the space is great as well as the music and shall i say the entertainment which i deemed as entertaining by way of the chef cooking and dancing to despasito he had tons of rhythm once i dig into the menu i was so excited to see that they had vegan options my vegan tacos were super yummy my husband had shrimp and chicken tacos which he loved our son had cheese quesadilla and he ate it all my sister in law had shrimp tacos with pico on the side she enjoyed we all were very fond of the house chip and dip as it was fresh and the red sauce was super flavorful and my favorite of the two provided as we received a green sauce as well that our toddler liked since it was not as spicy this place is a must do when in singapore especially if you are a vip member of my travel club as we earn travel upon paying our tab win win win,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,who knew i would be drinking a beer from northern california brewery eating asian mexican fusion food in singapore i thought it was awesome they had lost coast brewery is stout as a beer option here if i am going to pay singapore prices for alcohol might as well be a craft beer right the korean po boy was pretty filling loved the house chips here pretty huge but with the green was bomb,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,ugh it is just about average food can be a little dry and staff pretty disengaged quite loud inside really hard to hold a conversation,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,vatos urban tacos knows exactly what they are doing when it comes to authentic mexican tacos i gotta say that i was a little hesitant to go for tacos in singapore i mean if i sometimes cannot find good tacos in the usa which is just north of the border from mexico how was i going to find real tacos in singapore but i was wrong obviously not all of their menu is authentic mexican they do have a lot of tacos and dishes which are a fusion of mexican with korean and other styles to keep it traditional we order the tacos de carne asada and to try something new had the tacos de pollo con kimchi the carne asada tacos were legit the meat was so tender and flavorful the red salsa was spicy and delicious and the tortilla was made to perfection the carne asada tacos definitely made me think about my hometown of ciudad juarez in mexico the kimchi chicken tacos were also really good and fresh but i gotta say they were a little too oily for my taste and could barely taste the chicken it was definitely something i had never tried before and i actually kind of like it also we were here on a tuesday and they had a deal of  tacos for the price of  winning,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,good for americans who need a taste of home while on vacation the service was good and the food was better the menu needs to state all ingredients we had a vegan with us who requested the vegetable burrito bowl and asked for the crema to be left off it does not say there is cheese on it but it came with cheese when we explained the person was vegan they immediately fixed it they were apologetic and fixed it with no issues their nachos are some of the best,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,the food was average the staff were lacklustre and i left thinking the place was run like it did not matter that you have paid a fair bit for a good night out worse of all no one else seemed to care that they were paying high prices for really average food and service not a good investment in a night out compared to mexican restaurants in la or vegas this was pale in comparison,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,as a california native i can assure you the food is on point while visiting singapore with my family we visited vatos on a whim mexican food in southeast asia it was incredible the guacamole and og margarita were excellent no bottled mix here just tons of fresh lime juice the korean fusion elevates traditional mexican dishes to a whole new level you have got to try the kimchi carnitas fries they are out of this world the fat bastard burrito bowl lives up to it is name it is ginormous but very tasty loved the addition of a crispy cheese layer to the quesadilla a note to another reviewer freshly made corn tortillas are supposed to be thin i am sorry we were too full for dessert the place was busy and as others have noted loud but the service was good overall i would highly recommend,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,awesome place great fusion tacos loved the korean galbi tacos and the shrimp tacos were incredible will definitely be back i wish there were  stars,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,first things first do not be alarmed when your party is food does not arrive at the same time the plates are delivered as they come out of the kitchen you will see this throughout singapore vatos tacos is a delightful mexican korean fusion that offers a break from the oodles of noodles sorry could not help myself and rice you will consume whilst in singapore chips more accurately tortillas and salsa are complimentary with your visit what i got and what i thought  chimichurri chicken urban taco delicious would absolutely have this again the chimichurri was perfectly tangy and a great complement to the spicy chicken while it did have a nice kick to it i finished the tacos without a tingling sensation on my lips as long as you can handle a couple of chilies you will be golden if you are interested in a dish that has the fire emblem next to it but you are worried about spice just ask the waitstaff what you need to prepare for  honey tequila chicken wings best part of the meal and a great option to share with the table as you could surmise from the name of the dish the wings are sweeeeeeeeeeet but they do come covered in slices of chilies the heat fearing members of my party were able to fully enjoy the wings by removing the chilies this is a simple task vegan and vegetarian options are available,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,good food nice environment great selection almost to much to choose from only service was lacking a bit with plenty of staff they could have gotten us to order a few more margaritas had they only asked and never asked us we wanted desert by the time we got the bill we did not,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,mexican food in singapore yes absolutely yes if it is what your craving this is the place chips and salsa drinks and the food is good loved the salsa,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,first night in singapore and fou d this hidden gem it needs to be on your must try list chimichuri street tacos with enough heat to numb your lips but filled with so much flavor you wo not stop eating,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,long story short  for a margarita is insane go somewhere else for a drink only go on taco tuesday to get  tacos for the price of  at  service could be improved greatly i waited at least  mins to place my order the barbacoa tacos were delicious but i wo not be back,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,the place was having korean mexican filipino thanksgiving party with iskina cebu the place was packed but lucky i had made a reservation in advance we were showed to a high chair table by side the place was quite noisy with tables spread to the walkway as outside was raining chimichurri lechon tacos s   pieces handmade tortilla ssamjang aioli iskinu cebu lechon chimichurri salsa the serving was quite small it was quite messy to handle the tacos the flavours were yummy jalapeo pork belly lechon tacos s   pieces handmade tortilla ssamjang aioli iskinu cebu pork belly lechon pickled onions jalapeos relish the serving was quite small it was quite messy to handle the tacos the flavours were yummy i am rick james peach s  frozen peach margarita tecate beerthe margarita was served in a glass with the beer bottle upside down it was not too sweet oh man i was red like a peach after having the drink did not get to try the roasted chicken which was also that night special item as it was sold out by the time we placed order,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,reservations highly suggested we came on a random tuesday night and this place was packed since we came all this way we did not want to improvise so we said we would order for take away luckily a table opened up during our wait because the expected wait time is between  minutes to  hours judging from the crowd anticipation filled our hungry souls the menu is not extensive but enough to make you ponder about what to order we looked at the menu for a good  minutes before we decided on what to order dinner all of us got the fat bastard burrito bowl this was our favorite thing here my colleagues and i could not stop raving about it the rice the sour cream the beans the carne asada was beautifully and deliciously executed the kimchi fries were pretty good the kimchi had a kick and i loved the jalapeos the fries seemed to come out of a bag though the galbi no rice burrito i had the following day for lunch was packed the galbi was tender and let is just say that it was too good to eat just half of it i loved how tender yet firm the black beans are the sauces that it came w only elevated the overall taste no sauce needed craving a burrito bowl now,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,traveling alone on business with a free day in singapore after visiting the national museum i decided to stop here for lunch street tacos are pretty common back in the us and this looked intriguing i will admit the bar is pretty high given the quality of this type of food back home but i thought i would give it a shot while i really wanted this to be good there were several negatives the first of which is they only will serve a two taco minimum so if you are a party of one and you want to sample three different tacos you are out of luck it is only  of one type or  of two types etc no big deal if you are dining with friends but cut me some slack i am a party of one who really wanted to sample your food and you would not do it even with a polite request to make an exception so i ordered  pork barbecoa and they were delicious so delicious i was wishing i could have tried some others the cowboy queso on the other hand was so bland and tasteless it is as if someone just melted some plain cheese in a bowl so we are batting   on food quality then there is the service kind of disinterested and bothered would he how i would describe it ordered a beer and a water with my meal and the water never showed my server never showed again either and i had to all but stand up and wave my arms when it was time to go it is a pretty nice place and the one taco i tried was delicious but beyond that there is not much to recommend here and given the negatives i am not sure i would come back so much excellent food in singapore so lots of other options,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,so where do i begin opened about a month ago vatos is definitely a cool spot to grab a bite and or drinks the margarita drinks look crazy with the inverted bottle of beer cider plunged into the frozen margarita glass as for the food for me it is not something new and exciting roy choi started the whole korean taco theme in los angeles circa  and it is been duplicated around the world i am still looking for the place in sg that serves up the tex mex cali mex versions that my palate is familiar with do not get me wrong vatos is a great choice for asian influenced mexican street food the tacos were how do i put it tasty but unsubstantial maybe i am jaded by being from california but  for a couple of tacos is kinda pricey the homemade tortillas were good but a little thin the flavors were a mash up of mexican and korean which i enjoyed the kimchi carnitas fries were a bit salty do not know if the fries were salted hopefully not because the kimchi cheese and carnitas were already sodium loaded would come back again because there are things on the menu i still want to try mucho gusto,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,this place is just mediocre the food is not as flavorful as it should be it is overpriced and the service is poor,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,finally made it for taco tuesday four of us ordered the happy hour kimchi carnitas fries and  types of tacos kimchi carnitas fries   starsgreat dish to share but we all did not remember there was kimchi till halfway through perhaps there was not much kimchi in it to begin with galbi beef taco  starsthis was my favorite we gathered that it was slightly sweet so those who were not fond of sweet mains picked the prawn one as their favorite chili and lime prawn taco  starsthis was my second favorite the prawns were fried well and still crisp warm and flavorful when i had them fish taco   starsi do not know if it is because i had this after the prawn taco that by then it had gotten way too soggy and the breading was too thick and just tasted like oil granted there was a decent amount of fish in it carne asada taco  starstoo spicy for all of us not much flavor i remember  for  of us so that is a very decent  each and i am still full the morning after does this make me  taco girl d not sure i am dying to go back though i guess i would have to try their burritos a bit noisy for dinner conversation and i am getting to the age where i do not like yelling over the dinner table anymore,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,this place has good tacos and guacamole i got take out and they were very friendly i am a texan living abroad so i get taco lonely easy and these ones set me right for a spell,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,so far so good happy hour is  pm and for  you can have kimchi carnitas fries and two beers a good deal good fries good beer will be back for the rest update i have been back and it is still good tacos the korean inspired ones were better than the mexican inspired ones in my opinion finally do you love raw onions i mean really really love them do you want to have an onion party in your mouth long after your meal is over then vatos is the place for you run do not walk make reservations it is popular vatos is located in the old building part of south beach right next to shaw tower and facing beach road,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,friendly place with lots of good options i throughly enjoyed the vatos style veggie burrito definitely would say was worth every penny seems like a lot of the food there has their own twist to it definitely would recommend,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,not really sure what all the fuss is about the food is horrible drinks are non local and overpriced restaurant is dirty and they need more staff location is great in south beach area maybe that is the draw from austin and i know the korean mexican style cooking that is all the rage in austin and socal but these guys missed the mark kimchi fries which is their main dish was inedible the jalapeo barbacoa spring rolls were unique but not too bad thus the one star when you pay they take your credit card and then disappear for almost  min i will have to pay attention to charges now one star for the spring rolls zero stars for service food and drinks,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,archived draft from    i realized i forgot to hit post but here it is the  edited version southern california style korean mexican food i never thought i would see this food combination here in singapore but here it is this place really reminded me of the k mex type places in socal especially los angeles the ingredients are tasty and fresh and the corn tortillas are rolled fresh in the kitchen i usually get the kalbi short rib korean pork belly and baja fish tacos and the kimchi carnitas fries it is that interesting spicy fusion cuisine that brings back memories of la and its my choice of comfort food food and service standards have since dropped a bit since opening in  but i have since been back regularly to satisfy my taco cravings vatos is a chain from seoul started by three former korean american california residents one of the restaurant is founders sid kim was actually doing the serving and checking on the tables the night i visited in jan  when they had just opened for business they have since expanded to another location in the west of the island at timbre in buona vista do not come in here expecting the authentic deal mexican food and you will be okay which is best left to the experts at another restaurant  stars in  but has since fallen to  stars in  stars are relative to the quality of mexican food you can find in singapore,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,ok so this place was decent for being in asia lol i would have given them  starts for effort but they had jarritos so i had to give them an extra star so here is my break down  stars for food it was just ok in my opinion but to be fair i am from the land of mexican food and korean street tacos  stars for alcohol and beverage selection the margaritas made me feel like i was back home i will definitely be back for drinks and maybe some appetizers i do wonder where they get their avocados from tho lol,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,good atmosphere and service especially by singapore standards but the food was just ok i will go back to try more items as the kimchi fries looked awesome galbi tacos enjoyed these the mostspicy chicken quesadilla pro ably would not order again seemed to have been cooked in a lot of oil or butter,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,after enjoying my meal i took a peek into their kitchen to see if they had mexicans preparing food that is how good it was i recently moved to singapore born and raised in nyc and this was the first time i felt like i was back in the states eating delicious tacos while drinking pints from colorado things you must order kimchi carnitas friesgalbi short rib tacosbaja fish tacosthe moment i realized my fries were crispy and fresh under a blanket of carnitas and kimchi i knew this place was legit very happy to have found a place that can remind me of home,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,food has a fishy taste i am from california so i know my expectations cannot be high but would never eat here again,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,good vibe service was quick food was ok growing up in california i have got low expectations for mexican food in asia europe so this was about what i hoped for would be better if they went for straight mexican dishes id much rather a real burrito than a burrito bowl i also think that an  guacamole appetizer should have more than half an avocado in it but all that said it is a fun place might come back,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,sad to say the standard of food at vatos has dropped since  i thought it was a one off where maybe the chef on that day was new or having a bad day but i gave it two more chances and was still disappointed with the tacos the soft tacos tasted too floury and the fish batter too thick and oily you dont taste the fish the only redeeming dish is the honey tequila chicken wings because of course you cannot screw up chicken wo not be back again,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,food was worth the price i enjoy this place with my family members but they may be very busy during the weekends,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,i live in the outskirts of sg so stumbling on vatos via ubereats was a happy occurrence i ordered two items that were not exactly inexpensive for one person but both were delicious enough to be worth the price the spicy chicken tacos were served with soft shell tortillas messy and great tasting with fresh ingredients and tender chicken that came with two sauces albeit not very spicy but still pretty memorable the tequila wings were reminiscent of your typical fried korean wings with a sweet and spicy kick balanced with the offering of blue cheese enjoyable meal and my now new go to for taco tuesdays everyday,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,this is for sure a hip place to eat with some tasty food to boot the honey tequila chicken wings are delish the tacos are tasty street carnitas baja fish and the carne asada are my favs,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,this place was a great discovery a friend and i went on a saturday afternoon for a quick lunch and we were pleased he had the  korean pork belly tacos and i had the  barbacoa shredded pork tacos we swapped a taco as a taste test and both agreed that the pork barbacoa was much better than the korean the chunky pork belly in the korean taco was not as good as the shredded pork of the barbacoa the good plain and simple really good food the bad the stools are not comfortable the corn tortillas were a little on the small and thin side singapore has soft corn tortilla issues and only few places produce these with good results for the price they should serve salsa with the chips guacamole the guac was a little flavourless the verdict two big thumbs up really looking forward to returning to try the kimchi fries and other menu items i hear that evenings are crowded so make a reservation,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,i am a mexican food lover i am not a korean food lover i am an original cuisine lover i am not crazy over fusion and its blings and gimmicks i am a simple man with simple love for simple excellent food i see the great reviews therefore i decide to try this place since i have never had any mexican food in singapore before so i came here to try if the fusion between korean and mexican could be something that i love i was overwhelmed by the choices of food on the menu actually it comes to starter nachos usually and chicken wings tacos quesadillas burritos that i note none of the reviewers have tried drinks usually in great authentic mexican restaurant you will know whether you want tongue shoulders chicken fish etc for each here there are many to choose with its description of the sauce and everything food   i opted for the barbacoa pork shoulder taco with vatos special sauce and yes they are pretty spicy the taco is not using usual tortilla but something stronger to hold all the leaking meats on the taco yes it is gonna get messy pork is tender sauce is good portion is generous so great value for the money  for  tacos i also ordered the pork kimchi quesadillas since it seems to be one of their main item and i note many of reviewers really love their kimchi fries the quesadillas is not using tortilla instead using the same ingredients of flour that make a korean kimchi pancake it is pretty crisp cheese inside is melting but pork flavor is overpowered by the sauce and everything else it is quite pricey for  again i am more into a simple food that could bring forth the original ingredients taste and texture in vatos it is being a fusion restaurant the main attraction is the sauce at the end even though yes the meat is tender but i believe that it is being prepped and cooked with care and love by the team it is not what i will definitely get to visit when i have the chance btw drinks is quite pricey and they do not seem to offer any happy hour service   venue   great place to hang out since it is cozy and comfortable overall    it is a great place for anyone looking for something new and a fan of fusion food all reviews are based on my taste for original mexican food in san diego and jakarta bali with its taco local,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,vatos is freaking amazing i am not saying this bc i love korean food nor am i saying this bc i love mexican food i am saying this bc the food is just that good and when you combine those two cuisine wow speechless the must eats include kimchi fries sounds funny but imagine savory fries with an extra spicy cake from the kimchi the kimchi did not appear to be aged for too long so no sourness here just a bit of tart and an extra kick of spicy shrimp tacos loved this though i am not sure if the tortillas were made from flour or corn perhaps a combination of the two i prefer corn but the prawns were so large and juicy that all is forgiven quesadillas my gf loved this dish so much that she ordered it twice both for herself california salad got give some love to my home state and the salad is pretty great win win all around especially when you start thinking of about the carbs fat cheese calories on the menu the must drinks include vatos magaritas aka a large magarita with a bottle of beer popped in try grow a pear or sexy sanchez please do not google the latter until you have tried the drink texas tea this thing was huge not a surprise as it includes  kinds of liquors i usually finish my cocktails in about  minutes but this baby lasted me the whole night so it is worth that hefty price tag i also tried the mexican martini but it was too sweet for me this came as a surprise since it was a martini and i am a lady perhaps those with a sweet er tooth would enjoy the mexican martini more the atmosphere is great almost like stepping into a texmex steak house i also love the concept of an open kitchen the open bar helped as well seating wise be prepared for stools and no place to hang those handbags my lady friends and those with bad posture backs necks you have been warned oh yea the bathroom is located upstairs so you will need to walk outside of the restaurant hop into an elevator and go through a club before you can reach your destination vatos will definitely make a mark in the singapore food scene especially since korean mexican fusion has yet to be witnessed and tasted by most locals and many expats coming from california this fusion is not something new heard of bulgogi tacos anyone soooooo  and would satisfy the cravings of old timers like myself cannot wait to return and make vatos a daily stable in my diet psssst vatos is located below vanity eat here before drinking and partying,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,what a cool looking place with a faux industrial look it is a fusion korean mex place which i guess means you just add kimchi to everything most things have a little spicy kick the vatos burrito with kalbi can choose different meats was ok not great but ok kalbi kimchi fries etc sounds like it should be good but actually it is a bit too solid a food when compacted together i want something more balanced the kimchi fries were nice which is fries meat kimchi and cheese sounds similar ingredients to the vatos burrito but it is just better in that form looks like there are fun drinks here too i would come back to try some other things,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,imagine the smallest american town you can maybe a place where make america great signs are fading in front of every other mobile home next visualize the worst american style mexican you ever ate there maybe it was a place called panchos maybe it was senor pedros who knows it was bad maybe you went in got some refried beans from a can with some instant rice some tasteless generic salsa a burrito that was  filler and you remember being annoyed at wasting ten bucks now think of a restaurant that tastes literally two times worse and costs  for two appetizers three drinks and one burrito that would be the amazing restaurant that is vatos in singapore,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,loved it located right beside south beach hotel tucked away in the pretty white building you might just miss it if you do not look hard enough despite not making a reservation we still managed to get a seat for  pretty much almost immediately we ordered a spicy chicken rice bowl and prawn taco do not remember the exact name and the chips with guacemalo sauce i think thats the name food was served pretty fast and food was on point noms noms definitely coming back for more to try out the other dishes it was definitely a busy night but service was still really good so long for now till next time,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,after checking into my hotel checked out yelp to see what restaurants in the area may be appealing when i saw a mexican korean fusion place with good ratings had to go try it out there were many reviews about the special the korean kimchi fries but did not try them out had  of the korean pork bbq tacos instead the tacos had a nice touch of sliced dikon radish with good pickled flavors the pieces of pork bbq were decent though sliced a bit different than i normally see they were more chunks of pork rather than slices of korean pork that you normally see the mexican flavoring was on the light side would have liked to see more salsa and spice to the dish the salsa in the tacos was underwhelming the chips that they provided as an appetizer was a nice change instead of chips as small pieces it came out as  large pieces of chips that you broke into pieces but it was a bit on the stale side maybe came at the wrong time as it was  in the afternoon once i made it out here after checking into my hotel the salsa tasted like back home with the green chile verde and regular hot red spicy sauces they did have nice craft beers though did not know they had these types of beers in singapore the place has a happy hour or late night drinking and tacos or fries type of feel to it will have to come back with some colleagues for some food and drinks once i try the korean kimchi fries and some more drinks the rating may improve,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,yep this place is legit not easy to see from the street look for the south beach tower the restaurant is tucked into the white alcoved building on the beach road side i was seated at the bar right away visiting right when they open at noon on a tuesday immediately greeted by the bartender offering a nice selection of draft beers curiously all american micros like left coast modern times and stone i was perusing the menu for only a minute before another staff member came by asked if it is my first time and made food recommendations i ordered the prawn and pork belly tacos  each right away chips which are three giant tortilla chips were served with both green and red salsa which were both very tasty with a bit of spice the food came quickly and was presented simply two tacos each on two small plates the pork belly tacos are served with red and white onions and are a bit sweet and very tender very nice the prawn taco is similar to a fish taco you would get in san diego with cole slaw and salsa the prawns are lightly fried tacos are   each minimum two per kind per order and come on light tortillas  tacos with the chips and salsa and a beer was plenty of food for me overall a five star experience all around from the service to the food to the ambience definitely check it out if you are craving tacos in singapore,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,amazing food if you like hot and spicy best tamales i had in a while the chimichurri chicken tacos are even better yes chimichurri sauce on chicken def five stars for food the drinks though have a beer unless you like expensive light margarita mix without any alcohol,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,i will join everyone else in the praise of this place they are located in a nice looking white building on south brach road we had no reservations but they still managed to find seats for us service was in general great they were attentive and also served us some complimentary snacks when we had to wait a bit actually not very long for our food the a bit unusual combo of mexican and korean really works well they serve a variety of different tacos burritos enchiladas as well as some other larger dishes the tacos i sampled were all great but the galbi short ribs and the barbacoa pork where in a league of their own if you like spicy do also try the chimichurri chicken to make things even better they have a great beer selection and the cocktails looked interesting and not the mention huge will come again,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,was recommended this place by a friend excellent mexican fusion food the tacos nachos and burger were excellent friendly and helpful staff the drinks were good as well reasonable price considering the location but again the food was excellent,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,love this place would recommend the fish tacos and signature margarita ambiance is warm and energetic service was great,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,there is one outlet at timbre one north now i had trouble deciding what to get as there were so many permutation and combinations i really like quesadilla but the lady before me got some and it was like bright red looks so different from those at chipotle we ended up getting a burrito bowl and burrito considering that this is the low cost post clubbing fare in the states at  bucks this is not cheap they did serve nachos and salsa tho on the bright side the food here really quite good the korean pork was a little fatty but i pretty much polished it all up beans rice and all i will get the quesadilla next time,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,found this place here on yelp they really need to update their information given the number of visitors travelers to singapore if you so chose to come here please be ware the kitchen closes at pm even though the time says pm,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,korean mexican fusion with a delicious twist from the original roots in california the galbi tacos are delicious so are the fried quesadillas and the carne asada burritos the prices are reasonable for mexican food in singapore and the lost coast brewery craft beers or the frozen margaritas compliment the meal quite nicely the only knock is that i ordered vatos couple times through uber eats and both times comes cold and incorrect think it is more of an uber issue that vatos this place is awesome overall highly recommend,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,service was insipid food mediocre at best we had the cheese quesadillas baja fish tacos honey tequila wings kimchi fries a spicy chicken burrito bowl a nutella nachos amongst the  of us and nothing well except for the non existent service stood out to us really place was badly ventilated which the mobile coolers failed to help it does not suck but when you are spoilt for choice in a place like s pore being mediocre does not you any favours,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,vatos offers delicious mexican korean fusion food for a city deprived of quality mexican food choices i came by here on a weekday evening and was very satisfied with the food among the items i tried kimchi carnitas fries highly recommend generous portion and flavorful taste spicy chicken quesadillas great texture crispy on the outside inside was good but not as phenomenal as the kimchi fries pork urban tacos generous portion of meat served on tiny soft tortillas would be great if vatos increased the tortilla sizes to help customers feel like they were getting what they paid for overall great food in a casual fun ambiance would go back again if i could successfully secure a reservation like i did this time around,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,best tacos i have had in singapore even though it is korean mex tacos thank you for doing your carnitas well be it in tacos or in the kimchi fries tender moist and enough fatty bits yum i just wish they would not put lettuce in the tacos though it ai not korean nor mexican food comes out fast and service is also consistently pleasant and prompt oh and for your appetizer they serve you deep fried tortillas with two sauces the red roasted onion chipotle sauce was really good however the tomatillo salsa verde was a bit off cannot remember it was too bitter or smoky and i am someone that actually normally loves salsa verde and dislikes smoky chipotle salsas i wish they would allow you to mix tacos min order of  of the same kind so you would get to try more flavours  is enough if you are sharing an appetiser ah well guess i am coming back again which i really would not mind,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,friends invited us to the opening of this place and it is even better than the locations in korea loved the spacious and simple atmosphere added with awesome korean mexican fushion that you just do not see in singapore until now i used to frequent this place during my stay in seoul mostly the one in the basement of the galleria mall and the food is high quality full of flavor messy and delicious it is a different style of mexican fusion from what you get in california with the gogi trucks it is a less spicy and healthier with more veggies and ingredients that truly fit the korean palette must kimchee fries you cannot go wrong with this one quesadillas tastes like the ones back home in cali tacos were okay but i am biased bc i have always favored the authentic mexican tacos over the fusion ones vatos magaritas it is pricey at around  per drink but it actually turned out to be double or triple the normal margaritas you would get elsewhere the upside down beer in a margarita kept the drink flowing and it was just a fun drink to toast with friends will be back singapore life is getting better and better,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,this just might be my new go to when i am craving sit down mexican granted the prices still are not pretty e g  for  tacos but they still beat some other mexican joints out there in singapore and the level of fusion deliciousness is on point i wholeheartedly and full stomach edly recommend the quesadillas both the spicy chicken and prawn ones combined korean and mexican flavors in surprising ways and were very yummy extra points for the cool vibes vatos is secretly hidden away inside a nondescript white building cannot wait to be back for dinner,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,first things first this place has got queso not something that looks like queso but actual cheesy queso with jalapeos and its damn good and tacos galore shrimp tacos chicken tacos all kinds of tacos sorry for all the exclamation points but this place is one for the books and i cannot wait to come back this texas girl has a found her new favorite restaurant in singapore,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,we got here about half an hour before the kitchen was to close so we were instructed to order quick we got signature margaritas about the cheapest you can find in singapore for the size vatos cowboy queso and an assortment of tacos fish chicken shrimp asada everything was yummy and fresh tasting we lived in south texas and thought this place was great service was fast and friendly the decor is funky go,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,this place kicks ass every single dish we ordered was on point  kimchi fries i have never had anything like it and it was so good they even include a sweet sauce that balances the flavors completely i can eat this alone all day long  short rib tacos really really good baja fish tacos another wow i grew up loving rubio is fish tacos in california and i actually like this one at vatos much better it is crispy enough and full of flavor  honey tequila chicken wings really good but be careful these are spicy  chips and guacamole great guacamole they have your range of lost coast brewery beers on tap service is great and ambiance is very grungy and cool highly recommend to bring friends or a date for something different that will be more exciting than your usual dinners,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,absolutely love this place the south beach is an architectural wonder itself beautiful at night had the one in itaewon seoul and was not disappointed by the ambience nor the food quality perfect place for a friday night out the kimchi fries are a must try we also had their galbi tacos and the kimchi pork quesadilla the quesadilla was done like a korean pancake very very nice although these three dishes were a tad bit of carb overload for our party of two our small stomachs are to blame though the kor mex fusion is done very nicely almost bringing me back to la itaewoni would not recommend seating outside though i think that is where the kitchen ventilators get released it smells too much of oil for my liking was pretty suffocating another point do give their margaritas a try cannot miss that out looking forward to trying their other drinks the next time i am there,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,great place to chill out and have great food the fusion between korean and mexican worked well the food being more mexican inspired with some korean twists it is tough to find good mexican food in singapore which is why this place is a gem,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,food was good service sucked ate lunch solo at the bar bartender disappeared he was eating at the table behind me waited  mins for him to return to the bar no other server checked on me when he return to the bar he started washing glasses and did not even check on me had to ask to pay the bill apparently half the staff eats at the tables in the dinning room at once maybe try getting takeout,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,i will basically co sign what debbie wrote was a big fan of vatos in seoul and am glad to see the mexican korean fusion options growing in singapore from zero to one,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,i have made reservations twice but failed to turn up for both times and last night i made an impromptu walk in and lucky me i was able to get seatings they are always almost fully booked so making a reservation is highly encouraged it is a vibrant place with a wide array of different ethnicities for customers although i have read many negative reviews about the service in vatos mine was the complete opposite the wait staff tagged to me was a casual muslim dude with a bubbly personality sincere and prompt it made the whole experience even better food was immaculate the best burritos in town for me this diner is the perfect distinctness for koreanmexican fusion cuisine if only the indoors were not so deafening it would be perfect location  environment   indoors because of the musicenvironment   outdoors service  food,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,so i really wanted this place to be something awesome but ok so here it is beer cold salsas nice and fresh service is ok hip ambience location walkable from bugis vegan options if you ask taco wrap the suck i mean really thin fall apart messy up your sleeve crappy nothingness impossible to eat unless you go with a spoon how about switching to crispy taco shells cmon,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,place is alright i got few types of tacos i thought it would satisfy my craving for cali kogi truck the meat does not really capture kbbq or mexican grill the tortilla does not really taste good and kinda soggy but the kimchi fries are pretty good i would probably come here again for some fries and drinks,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,well truly what do you think the odds are of having tacos in singapore if you thought zero you are wrong thank goodness for vatos urban tacos although not a pure california street taco experience there was a mix of more traditional and sorta asian fusion across the menu really the namesake kimchi fries i found the salsas fantastic and the tacos quite good what really made the experience was a great selection of primarily california craft beers,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,we were not too far away when i decided to open my app and see what was around me the word vatos just stood out growing in california and also being hispanic how could i not identify i am glad we did visit this place i enjoyed the tamales which were excellent and the accompanying sauces were fresh we also ordered some pork rib tacos that were filled with loads of meat lastly the drinks were large made with excellent ingredients and tasty they even had tequila from corralejo we even talked to the guy who runs the place and he is also a west coast california native awesome guy keep it up and will definitely be back for this week,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,ok guys mexican korean asian fusion restaurant rating  with a heavy heart because i think this place has potential but food quality is very good meaning the ingredient i would say  but it is not your traditional zesty spicy and fresh mexican food which they actually claim not to be a mexican restaurant when someone says tacos my mind goes to mexico spicy zesty fresh you wo not get it here if i want to be critical then this place lacks of food identity if i want mexican i wo not come here if i want korean i wo not come here if in mood for asian fusion same thing staff very friendly attentive they do happy hours  pm  for  which i think will end once they establish themselves but great nevertheless i miss ceviche on the menu ambience is cool hipstery and industrial go try i would love to see your opinion,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,my family loves this place the drinks are awesome and fairly priced for singapore for the most part the food is really good try anything with pork and you will be set up for taste bud happiness standouts imo were the pork tacos tamales guacamole chicken wings and chili lime prawns even if it is mid week make sure to call for a reservation so many places in singapore seem to come and go as soon as they open so here is hoping that vatos urban tacos stays around for a long while,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,simply put vatos is pretty good mexican food not great not amazing but pretty good especially for singapore good atmosphere as well,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,mexican food in singapore i would been on the hunt for months and had not found anything decent vatos looked promising so i headed in for lunch one afternoon i found it to be just tolerable in terms of food but was pleasantly surprised by my drink i got the cowboy margarita it tasted great and was pretty strong by singapore standards there is also a little beer selection in addition to the cocktails the chicken fajita burrito was disappointing its mild spice was the only redeeming quality underneath that spice is a bland excuse for a burrito the chicken was gross and the vegetables indistinguishable there was some appetizer that was basically fries covered in slop again pretty bland large portions my grandparents were in love with this place the entire meal they were making comments about how they wished they had vatos in the us the fries are so good just the right amount of spice tacos look authentic etc it was nice to see them enjoying a meal with such enthusiasm but these are people who voluntarily eat at aztecas american mexican chain restaurant i could definitely recommend this place for drinks but i would avoid the food if you have had legit mexican before as a bar  stars as a restaurant,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,if you crave for some mixed meals of mexican and korean vatos will be where to go though the food was unlike the original in korea we still enjoyed the kimchi fries and their specialty dishes good enough to sooth down our longing for korea since we moved  years ago the ambiance is more like a bar than a restaurant with tall chairs and loud noise the funny thing is it has a chic restroom with special touch up section for ladies will we come back may be that will be once in a year coz there are many other better korean restaurants around,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,some of the best barbacoa spring rolls i have had anywhere great ambiance fat bastard burrito was good too,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,service needs improvement menu prices were labelled wrong we were charged more for some items after pointing it out they did not take any action i personally do not see the fuss over their signature kimchi fries they were served soggy and overall were underwhelming the kalbi beef and shrimp tacos were ok do not go here expecting good authentic mexican food good to try though,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,could not get reservation  days in advance so do make reservations in advance i was informed though that if i walked in there could be seats available in the outdoors walked in at  pm outdoor seating was available chill quiet atmosphere quite different from the inside which seems quite lively yet cozy however there is no shelter outdoor so fingers crossed that it does not rain and just a minor detail we found the stools outdoors a little uncomfortable food was received extremely quickly serving seem small at first but was filling recommend the fish tacos  for  and the chicken chimi tacos  for  we were put off by the price of the drinks but when they were served we had no qualms about the price for they were enormous one drink should last you the whole night no worries sharable if you do not want to spend  bucks on drinks as it is again huge guacamole chips  were underwhelming though would have like it to have more lime and seasoning in it more tortilla chips could have been served too as i felt it was not worth the price for such a small serving next time i would pass on the guac which is a shame as every mexican place should have great guac overall a very pleasant experience not a first date option as eating can get messy and was impressed by the excellent service could turn to be one of my fav places in bugis for a quite yet casual chill night out,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,this is amazing i have been looking to try tacos in singapore but it was really difficult to find a place until i have discovered vatos urban tacos ordered the baja fish tacos and the kimchi fries which are both very delicious potions were good and prices reasonable too the atmosphere was also pretty lively probably due to the full bar and the cool drake music playing in the background i would totally go back to try other flavours,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,favorite place from our visit to singapore i got the queso dip and carne asada tacos food is great and staff is awesome,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,i ended up eating at vatos for two more consecutive saturdays with different groups of friends what can i say i pitch restaurants really well and my taste is legit just kidding hahaha i have discovered that the mushroom and spinach quesadillas are awesome and you should skip the pork belly tacos the kalbi tacos can be a bit dry depending on the night but the pulled pork is the bomb also the mag is are huge and delicious hello passion fruit and as i write this i think i have persuaded myself to eat lunch there now,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,good very good never experience it before like it very much oh dear very very good thank you so much loving it,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,i had mixed feelings about fusion mexican until i moved to asia and i have enjoyed the renaissance in mexican food in korea and have been to the original vatos in itaewon many times their new location in singapore captures the spirit and tastes albeit in a smaller space but at a very nice price point for the singapore market the decor is very similar a distressed space with exposed brick and lamps and iron furnishings the bar is nice with many taps but quite small as for the food it is a mix of fusion eg kalbi tacos and classic e g carne asada carnitas i prefer the classic versions and the hot sauce here packs quite a punch prices are very reasonable for singapoire on average   for two tacos not one i loved the indica ipa on draft although the price for pint was more than for two tacos cannot be helped here i suppose i also noted that they had a tamale on the menu but at  it better be one damn good tamale overall i am very happy to see vatos in singapore and the concept and price point should work well in this market,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,i am from texas and i have lived in california and visited mexico often so i was a bit dubious when i first heard of this new restaurant i should not have been it is really good they have an imaginative menu and have done a great job of combining flavors from korean mexican and texmex cuisines top it off with some good margaritas or ice cold tiger beer and you have got yourself a good casual place to eat with friends and family i will be sure to visit again when i get back to singapore in a few months,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,this is our newest addition to the mexican scene here in singapore and i must say its a welcome one i came here from la and remember when the kogi taco truck craze first started this place really gets pretty much everything right the food is great i havent worked through the whole menu yet but the pork belly and galbi tacos are amazing i loved the kimchi fries as well everything is great for sharing they have a great selection of american microbrews on tap as well as numerous margaritas and cocktails on top of all this its a nice cozy atmosphere nice decor and the staff our very attentive and take good care of you you can tell they work hard to make a great place to enjoy your food and drinks this is definitely my new go to spot for mexican sure korean mexican fusion isnt truly mexican but neither is taco bell and i still love it i am not afraid to admit that so come try this place,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,so the food here is actually decent good spices flavors and ingredients what are horrendous are the portions the burrito is literally four bites all tortilla with very skimpy portions inside i have now tried this place three times hoping it was just a one off but it is not the portions are just a complete joke the owners are intentionally gouging people or do not care,Negative
vatos-urban-tacos,great mexican food with a nice subtle korean twist i had the pork tacos and kimchi carnitas fries which did not disappoint cannot wait to go back,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,this place is amazing i do not oftentimes give props to a restaurant but the combination of great food particularly mexican food with fantastic drinks and a great ambiance gives this place a strong  the staff is also very helpful and friendly,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,ordered delivery from this place the kimchi fries are the best if there is only one thing you are ordering from this place it has to be that,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,delicious tacos and guacamole service was a bit absent minded despite being the only ones in the restaurant the food is superb we ordered shrimp tacos beef tacos and guacamole it is authentic and fresh and i cannot wait to return,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,great food drinks and atmosphere at reasonable prices but make sure to make reservations as it can get busy in the evenings,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,great food and this is coming from a mexican american living in california here on business i stopped in for dinner after searching for places to eat in the vicinity of my hotel this place seemed interesting so i gave it a try i was seated promptly and greeted at the table by chips fried whole corn tortillas and salsa i was pleasantly surprised with the red tomatillo salsa good flavor with just the right amount of spice it tasted authentic tortillas chips were a little under fried but still good i ordered the spicy chicken tacos orders come in  or  tacos and wow nice fresh chicken with a spicy a little on the mild side for me sauce and soft corn tortilla yes it was different from authentic so cal or tex mex but what do you expect from an asian infused mexican joint i am very picky when it comes to mexican food and this hit the spot paired with a great white beer on tap and i was in singapore heaven will definitely be stopping by again before i leave,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,love the quesadilla with the korean pancake twist the galbi short rib tacos are great too reminds me of kogi food truck back in la would be nice if the place has happy hour,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,the kimchi fries are amazing also loved the soft tortillas on the tacos and their complimentary chipotle sauce with tostada chips definitely recommend,Positive
vatos-urban-tacos,very under whelmed service was fast and efficient though perhaps it was my choice but the guacamole was very bland and the chilli prawns tacos were as well hint lime and chilli and  prawns per taco really sorry more trendy than substance,Negative
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,yesss the good news i can finally cross santouka off my man i wanna try that one day list the bad it is now on a cravings list and  is not exactly what you want to spend on lunch everyday the deal lunch sets are excellent spicy fans go for the kara miso broth its depth of flavor really sets this place apart from other places the sitch i suspect i reaaalllyyy enjoyed this lunch because the place was empty super late lunch and the servers were still so super friendly and attentive throughout i imagine the eating experience would be very different at peak hours when you are basically sitting on top of the person next to you tl dr eat lunch here at a non peak time for ramen you wo not regret,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,a bit difficult to find nd floor far corner looking at the hotel and river mapquest has a different name not helpful ramen santouka is what you have to plug in and you have to know nd floor had better ramen in tokyo dah but good and inexpensive for table service in singapore  beers gyoza salad and soft boiled egg ramen was only  singapore dollars   us the salad was super fresh beers were great  tiger and  asahi ramen good pork was a bit too fatty for me good and friendly service,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,great location and great food for someone who is not well versed in raman or even like soup there are other options to choose from here that can satisfy the ol appetite my co worker and i shared the yaki gyoza which were excellent i also had their fried chicken which i would go back just to have that again and i had a salad which was a good side but honestly cannot remember much about it anymore my co worker had one of the ramen bowls which he thought was pretty good but i do not think it is the best he is ever had location is great as it is right on the quay the restaurant is fairly small so it is more intimate and i did not feel like my food was mass produced service was kind of interesting as i was not sure if they choose not to attend tables unless required but they were polite and helpful when we did flag someone down you pay at the desk not at the table which no one explained to us so we sat for quite some time at the table i would totally come here again,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,this place is amazing the staff is extremely courteous and helpful each person that came to our table was so nice the food was beyond delicious i had the original ramen with pork and gyoza each little gyoza was perfect and tasted like it was made with jesus tears i highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a happy belly a fantastic experience,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,one of the best ramen really authentic japanese ramen love the spicy version with cheeks the cheeks are really tender and melt in your mouth the only reason on why i do not give  stars is due to the side dishes i thought they are only average try both chicken karagee and fried pork dumpling both are average keep with the ramen it is the good one,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,everything we had was super good and we wished we could eat more even after being full the pork cheeks were unbelievable and everyone should have them at least once in their life we also had the miso soup delicious the salmon salad and sushi,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,nice place second floor above the street facing clark quay ordered the special ramen which was great flavor rich with very nice tender pork and the bun less recommended and the fried pork gioza which were really tasty,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,the broth was delicious it is one of the best i have had in singapore i got the spicy miso with the pan fried dumpling set and savored every bite i have to agree that the chasiu was not as tender as i would have liked but that broth the dumplings were some of the most flavorful i have had the staff were very friendly as well and helpful when narrowing down choices i cannot wait to go back,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,the ramen was superb i upgraded from pork belly to pork cheeks amazingly fall apart tender and quite lean and i had the spicy miso base which was not that spicy just enough to make it interesting the noodles were thick but still al dente good mouth feel the chicken karage was delicious and the gyoza were almost perfect my only complaint in the course of an hour we heard an endless loop of kenny g despite how good the ramen is it does not make up for the audible torture i had to endure my tip definitely try this but bring your earphones,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,honestly i have had much better ramen the the bay area but it is the first ramen i have had in singapore i was craving ramen so gave this a shot it took me awhile to find i left decently full but found the shoyu ramen to be too salty also the salty and fatty pork cheek added to the saltiness the atmosphere was nice because you can look out onto the river the only issue was the waiter consistently kept trying to upsell add ons to the ramen and dishes to multiple tables around it was annoying the upsell table by table and then the customers would just say no question after question they should know when to stop asking in my opinion or just not be so aggressive with the upsell which is why i decreased my review from a  to  stars not the best ramen and for the price i could try another place rather than returning i will have to update this review when i try other ramen in singapore tip seems like they are a part of certain promotions with credit cards etc it may be worth checking out of the deals and if it is available for santuoka,Negative
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,great food good service reasonable prices a little tricky to find in the upstairs location but once you are there it is very good it is also not very touristy for being right in clarke quay i have been a few times for lunch and dinner and it is always very tasty i always get the standard ramen base and it is always so salty and flavorful will continue to go back,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,hands down my fave ramen in town so good it was one of my bucket list of final places to eat during my last week living here seriously the pork cheeks are melt in your mouth amazing and the broth is equally as tasty even the service is well above average for singapore standards you wo not leave disappointed,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,yum while visiting singapore i had been looking for a place with decent food along the quay is found this via yelp and while it is up inside the clarke mall there is still a view of the river and action below i think i arrived rather late for dinner on a weeknight but there was no wait i was alone and was seated immediately i ordered one of the set menu is with prawns ramen and salad etc and it was a lot of food probably enough for two it was so much that i could not finish and they asked me upon checkout if everything was ok i thought that was nice they were concerned but it was delicious i just could not eat it all atmosphere is pretty standard but service and food was above average i would recommend for lunch or dinner,Negative
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,i am only home for   weeks and i have a long list of things i want to eat singapore is known for being a culinary haven if you are a foodie come to singapore i guarantee you will not be disappointed with so many options and only  stomach i had to make very smart and wise decisions every food choice is strategic it has to be the best if not why bother there are tons of ramen places in san francisco bay area however i always tell my friends nothing beats the options and quality available in singapore outside japan i think singapore is probably the only country with the most ramen shops per square mile there is fierce competition i researched and read reviews strategically planning which ramen shop to go to santouka was my final pick oh boy i was blown away the egg was perfectly cooked nicely set egg white and gooey soft egg yolk the shio broth was flavorful and not overly greasy you can pretty much drink up all the broth and not feel coagulated fat swimming in your stomach the noodle texture was great and it did soak up some of the flavor from the broth the pork jowl omg and omg one more time one bite and i felt my life is now compete well seasoned and cooked perfectly it tasted better than the pork jowl i had at lazy bear recently i have been to japan numerous times ate many bowls of ramen i must say i am in love with santouka ramen,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,one of the best ramen in singapore tucked away and hard to find but worth the hunt had the kara miso vegetable ramen and it was delicious lightly spicy not too salty or oily just the way i like it give this place a try if you have not already,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,good ramen and soup at good value nice views too i really like the kara miso ramen better then my expectation naturally i finished the bowl or noodles and the soup never one to waste my friend had the normal miso soup base apparently it taste just as good the gyoza is surprisingly moist inside and the skin is very thin i think they got the balance right the service is prompt and attentive too bad they only allow downsizing of the noodles but no upsizing i love good noodles so its a bit disappointing the afternoon sunny view of the river is a bonus i bet it looks better at night with all the clarke quay neon,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,for a delicious fulfilling ramen quick fix come here i always get the pork cheek and shio ramen but my friend who had the miso was quite disappointed as the miso base does not taste much of miso in my opinion the only flavors that should be on the menu are spicy miso and shio one word shiok,Negative
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,yelp brought me here i was staying in the area so it was a short walk for me to come here for lunch on a rainy day i am not a huge fan of ramen but wanted to see what the rave was about it was great broth and noodles where perfect and i ate everything i am giving it a  star because of the price point i think it was on the expensive side and ramen is not expensive also it took me awhile to find the location as it is hidden if you are in the central or clarke quay and looking for ramen come back here i am a fan,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,my favourite ramen in the many ramen chains here love shoyu while other broth pales in comparison or stinks of pork bones that i seriously considered conversion of my religion santouka has a delicious soup base strangely enough i could do without the pork cheeks i am just contented with the soup it is nice and rainy now coming to this page is agony to my tummy,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,located in the purple zone and also a corner of central is ramen santouka this was their first outlet in singapore their second outlet resides in cuppage plaza in orchard road santouka is founder hitoshi hatanaka opened his own ramen shop at hokkaido in  because he was unsatisfied with all other ramen establishments its thin noodle ramen with elegant broth topped perfectly with mouthwatering slices of char siu pork and pickled plums gained popularity in hokkaido immediately now in  there is outlets of ramen santouka all across the globe and my friends even mentioned the outlet in la tasted better than the outlet in singapore looking through the menu you realize that you get to pick your soup base be it shoyu soy sauce flavour miso soybean shio salt flavour or kara miso spicy soybean at  more the dining area of ramen santouka is a rather elongated one that stretches into the kitchen the chef is able to see every customer who walks in and walks out and for every customer that walks out the chef will say thank you for patronizing them it is very typical of japanese ramen shops in japan to be small and compact so that the chefs are also able to witness the customer is experience with their ramen miso ramen medium   i went with my lone favourite miso i admit the bowl looked small but it was deep after my first few dips with my chopstick i realized i was looking at the chance of skipping beard papa for desserts later the broth itself was thick and you could see a thin layer of oil swimming on the top it was not too gerlat as much i managed to drink quite a bit of the soup the noodles are the winner here they are extremely springy similar to that of maggie noodles and yet without the waxy exterior that instant noodles give you the texture of the noodles were consistent throughout the entire serving the bambo shoots here were also crunchy and since they absorbed all the flavour from the soup they sure were tasty the two glorious slices of char siew were not fatty at all instead they were tender pieces of juicy meat that again absorbed all the goodness from the soup i enjoyed my bowl of ramen as it did not have me craving for water like the ramen from other competitors which are ladden with msg leave me,Negative
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,pork cheek ramen nothing beats the pork cheek ramen sure it is a tad pricey but definitely worth it the pork cheeks are so soft they melt in your mouth i also like how the noodles are chewy i also recommend getting the spicy soup if you want a kick for the broth for the rest who prefer a combination of rice and noodles definitely order their set meals which serve up a generous half portion of ramen and a half portion of rice highly recommended,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,good soup base and quality tender pork belly and cheek noodle has good texture too even better if they can put more spring onion and green,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,here in singapore for work and absolutely loved it glad we found this place spent forever looking around for it nice place for a beer and a frosty mug too,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,one of the best ramen in sg i love that their grilled pork cheeks which is served on the side and not soaked in your bowl of ramen it is beautifully seasoned and comes with a great bite i like this much more than the typical char siew slices that comes with most ramen sometimes they just taste too fatty for me it is hidden in a corner in central though just look for the nasi padang restaurant rendezvous and it is right through it,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,so happy i got to eat here whole in singapore the ramen was delicious and the pork cheeks omg the pork cheeks were amazing i loved it so much that i have to order a side of them i do not think i have ever had pork just melt in my mouth like this i was very happy with my ramen and left very very full one thing i do not recommend ordering is ice tea i unless you are looking for some hot tea with a glass of ice then i suggest you skip that and simply go for a beer totally recommend going there because you wo not regret it,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,santouka in singapore as a frequent go er in los angeles i am content that there is one right in the central clarke quay i do not know if it is due to different origin of meats in the two locations but the pork here was not as tender as the ones served in la i always either get miso or shoyu and they do not dissappoint cannot wait to try ippudo singapore version soon,Negative
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,mmmmmmmm yummilicious my personal favourite ramen i first had santouka when i was in e us it was love at first slurp i was thrilled when they opened a branch here jumps pork cheek is simply divine its tender and tasty i visited santouka many times and i always find e soup tad salty but the pork cheek evens out e flaw in e soup that has always been my impression till my last visit last week e soup is no longer salty it was just right i had e kara miso which i wished was more spicy it doesnt taste spicy at all and i also like how they have a whole jug of water at e table to help yourself with awesome ramen unlimited water perfect view overlooking clarke quayside what more can you ask for,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,i am gonna say it this is the best ramen in singapore no contest at all everything from the set up to the furnishing to the food to the look of the chefs to the service is perfect and i have been there multiple times in peak periods yes and no and they were all great gastronomic experiences look at the picture of the pork cheek i have taken i call it angel is wings for a reason the texture is so soft and feathery it melts in your mouth instantly warming you up from the inside and taking you to the heavens the taste of the meat is distinct the moment you eat it it is there in you for life the soup is thick and heartwarming the flavours are well mixed and the noodles have a springy consistency that keeps you going after many spoonfuls the eggs are another level of genius you have to buy the extra eggs to try there is free plain water that comes in a jug for you woots and if you can get the seats that overlook the singapore river in this way you can check out the great night view outside and also turn to your left to revel in the open kitchen the mastery of the chefs if i have got one complaint it is that too many know about this place and i wish the queues were not so long every time check out eatlikeawhale blogspot sg for more pictures and reviews,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,have come here a few times but i think the ramen is still just average nothing much to rave about it i find it a little oily at times and the soup more to the salty side which does not taste natural i do like the pork that they serve though as it is tender than the ones i usually eat the egg was cooked really well not too runny or hard boiled but it hardly had flavour to it so still a miss for me the price i found was ok for the amount of noodles and meat that they had added to the dish service was a little on the down side maybe the staff were not trained properly i would rather go to other ramen stalls to fix my ramen cravings,Negative
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,located in a hidden corner at central clarke quay ramen santouka is a hidden gem that die hard ramen aficianados wish that reviewers would stop writing about space is a scarcity so expect long queues should you visit at peak timings service is brisk efficient and straight to the point and having had the chance to dine at ramen santouka in harajuku when i was on a holiday i can attest that the service levels and taste are all exactly the same one must have dish is their speciality toroniku or pork cheeks ramen the pork cheeks come on a separate plate with condiments from the ramen available in  different soup bases shio shoyu miso so you have the choice of pouring everything in or dipping them in one by one i recommend dipping it just tastes better having tried most of the other ramen joints that have sprouted up recently i can safely say that no one else comes as close as ramen santoukawhen it comes to taste service and quality of the food served,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,the first thing that greeted me at the entrance was the long queue at dinnertime on a weekday fortunately the wait was not too long and i managed to get a seat with my friend after about  minutes of waiting the service was friendly enough and i ordered my favorite bowl of shio ramen as usual i was presented with a great bowl of ramen with really thick and savoury soup however there is one thing that i would like to say the quality of the ramen is not that consistent sometimes the noodles would taste somewhat alkaline and other times the soup was not as savoury as usual but suffice to say that when your luck is good you will be eating one of the best bowls of ramen in singapore another plus about this restaurant is the great views of singapore river so do request for a seat near the windows if possible,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,my boyfriend and i were craving a good ramen so he decided to bring me here although we reached slightly past pm there was still a line in any case last order is at  pm so we still made it i do not remember the exact name of what we ordered but if i am not wrong he had a char siu ramen large and i had a shoyu ramen medium please go to my blog on my profile to see photos the ramen is a perfect balance between soft and chewy and the soup was really authentic tasting i was quite impressed because the soup is very flavorful the only downside is probably that the char siew pork was extremely tough we expected a more tender meat but i was left un glamorously gnawing at my meat anyway my boyfriend has a huge appetite and we were both quite hungry but the large ramen was too much for him and the medium was wayyy too much for me we could not finish the noodles i would say the large is good for sharing we also had a bbq pork bun each  and it was really really yummy it kinda looks like the chinese kung ba pao it is also served with a mini sized cup of tea which tastes like a normal chinese tea please go to my blog to see photos i do not quite know how to describe it overall it was a good experience the ramen is really good but i would not say it is the best in singapore if you are bored you can check out my blog on my profile to find out my favorite ramen place if we are in the area we will definitely come back when we have a ramen craving it is delicious and quite worth the price our check came up to about  for,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,thank you yelp for guiding me here and for helping me decide on what to order i really love love the pork cheek it is so tender and tasty in a melt in your mouth kind of way tried shio and shoyu broth and i prefer the shio because its cleaner tasting and is less salty vis a vis the shoyu the portions they give for the noodles are huge i was starving and yet could not finish only reason why this place did not get a  star from me was cos its slightly on the pricey side and there was a long queue so if you are starving think twice about eating here,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,amazing ramen the queue was not too long and the waiting time is short perfect dine in place for ramen lovers,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,this place is awesome omg the pork cheek is amazing your loss if you do not order it because it is perfectly done and oh so moist it has a slight bit of fat on the side but who cares the fat is not even oily at all and spitting cutting out the fat would just be a waste of all that lusciousness and as for the rest of the bowl no complaints the broth is perfect a regular size is not enough the noodles perfect you just have to spend a bit more for toppings but for such bliss it is all worth it,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,you can always count on a great bowl of ramen at santouka no matter which outlet you go to i would not call it the best i am partial to the darker richer kinds like at keisuke tonkotsu king and nantsuttei but that is just preference but it is pretty darn good the queues are not too bad perhaps because it is impossible to find it or anything at all at the maze known as the central,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,ramen hot soybean paste fried rice set the ramen broth was so good not too spicy just right the noodle was crunchy too fried rice was only meh had better i would recommend getting the tokusen toroniku ramen set you can choose your ramen choose hot soybean paste it is the best best part of the set is that it comes with a side of pork cheeks super good specially imported from the us it literally melts in your mouth  chicken gyoza love although i have tried the pork one and think it is better nicely pan fried comes out with a think slightly crispy skin super succulent and juicy inside careful when you bite it it is hot,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,when i first came to singapore i was skeptical about the idea of queuing for food particularly for mediocre food fortunately this place is one of the few that i would have no hesitation in queuing for the dozen or so times i have visited on a weekday evening there is a long queue thankfully the table turnover is high so the wait is never more than  minutes i am a ramen lover and for a decent bowl outside of japan this place is my normal go to when those cravings become unbearable being a shio ramen fan i will be honest in having no idea what the other items are like though saying that the pork cheek wow such a deep rich complexity combined with a soft tender texture if you dine here you must must must try it service is almost invisible during busy times though a great tasting bowl of ramen and pork cheek makes up for those short fallings jump in the queue and you wo not be disappointed,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,probably my favorite ramen in singapore i love the simplicity of the broth i prefer shio and the pork cheek is just heavenly i usually order chicken karaage as well and dip it into the ramen the only downside to this joint is the noodles it could just be personal preference though i prefer it thin but santouka is are a little bit on the thicker side ps they have another location in somerset somewhere near centrepoint same quality,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,santouka is consistently touted as one of the best ramen places in singapore and its popularity was clearly evidenced by the queue that was forming when i went there for dinner despite the crowd service was good as the staff were efficient without being brusque this really is a get in eat get out sort of dinner though so if you are looking for a more relaxed pace you are better off elsewhere it really is all about the ramen at santouka while santouka really does serve up a good bowl of ramen i do think there are better ramen places out there i have learnt though that ramen preferences can be very subjective so while i found the ramen a bit too chewy on the chewy springy spectrum some of my other friends loved it and while i thought the broth the shio broth was super tasty some of my other friends thought it was a bit too rich and salty but we all did agree that the egg was tasty though the yolk a bit too gelatinous and the pork cheek was fantastic and and just the right proportion of fat the portion is quite large though so if you are ordering the pork cheek ramen i would recommend ordering the smaller portion if you do not have a huge appetite,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,searching for ramen santouka is almost like a treasure hunt in the central attempt to reach it from another location in the mall other than the escalator near it and you would almost always lose your way though upon finding it the journey almost seems inconsequential as you peel back the curtains to reveal the treasure within springy handmade noodles served in a thick flavourful broth topped with tantalizing slices of cha shu roasted pork await the curious adventurer and delving into the tantalizing layers of each mouthful reward the palate like no other few ramen places can compare when it comes to the combination of both affordability and taste,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,our favorite ramen place in singapore has got to be santouka s declared this the best ramen in singapore even before we tried several other popular ones like marutama and ippudo the verdict still stands though the santouka brand which was started in  in asahikawa produces the best hokkaido ramen on our little island despite the secluded and hidden corner in central clarke quay the queue gets pretty crazy during meal times due to the small capacity it is about a seater and insane popularity i think it has only gotten better with the opening of a second outlet at cuppage terrace if it is your first time to santouka i highly recommend the tokusen toroniku ramen s   for shio shoyu miso s   for spicy miso for that price you would get a dish of roasted pork cheek and a bowl of springy and curly yellow noodles sides sold separately the jowl meat is the most precious and delicious part of the piggy it is only about  g per pig duh they only have  cheeks very richly flavored and tender this texture has been likened to fatty tuna i would say the meat is more firm this is pork not fish you know best ramen still ippudo does not come close,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,this ramen shop is one of my favorite ever since it opened at the central it is a small shop with a fairly good view typically most people like the soupy ramen but i prefer dipping ramen the noodles are thicker compared to the ones for the ramen it comes with a thick broth that tends to be too salty to drink but you can dilute its saltiness with tea and drink it as a soup oh yes do not forget to pair the ramen with a plate of their pork cheek slices for dipping ramen there are very few places that serve that in singapore so whenever i am in mood for dipping ramen ramen santouka is the place i will go,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,their ramen is considered the best i can find in singapore i particularly like miso and shio giving different taste and yet very fulfilling special pork cheek is a must try,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,overall i was really impressed with this place based on others reviews i ordered the ramen shoyu with pork cheek and a side of the soft boiled egg tamago thing the service was super quick but should be since all the ingredients are already cooked the ramen broth was very substantial more like a soup than a broth taste was excellent and i am sure a lot of that great flavor comes from the oils floating in the broth this is one of those dishes that if you do not finish it you should finish it though it is really good and put it in the refrigerator it would probably have a healthy layer of fat congealed on the top the next day also known as good flavor the pork cheeks contrary to everyone is comments does not actually melt in your mouth there is a little chewing required albeit not as much as say a pork chop of the same size the cheeks are really flavorful fat pork and salt how can you go wrong everyone loves bacon either you love it or you do not know you love it but you do love it this is bacon for kings i would eat the cheeks off these pigs any day the egg was also good for a hard boiled egg i liked the creamy center the marinade used to flavor the egg is very subtle and not overpowering i love them i should have ordered another this place is kind of difficult to find at least it was for me but if you are stubborn like me and have ramen on the brain like me you will get there i had to walk through a different restaurant just to get there and then on my way out i felt sorry for all the fools eating at that other restaurant they should have gotten ramen,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,my favorite ramen shop really delicious soup and also nice char siew have not been disappointed will keep going,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,broth is complex and flavorful and the noodles are done well the pork cheek is fatty and marbly a good addition to a small sized bowl of ramen i wanted seconds,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,the best place to get japanese ramen in singapore,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,best ramen i have ever had outside of japan this is a famous brand with many worldwide branches but the santuka in singapore is better than any others i have had in the us in the past it is very pricey if you go for the top end pork however and it does feel kind of strange to pay  for what is supposed to be a homey low class dish there is usually huge lines here if you go at the wrong times but turnaround is usually pretty fast,Negative
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,opps what if i say this place is even better than ippudo well in singapore at least i am not a fan of ippudo in singapore if you are like me give santouka a go the pork cheek is ohsodivine and the broth i swear i went to heaven right there my only complain the portions could be bigger sorry hungry what to do p,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,the tokusen toroniku ramen is something special the pork is very soft the miso broth is decent the noodles are top quality the only criticism is for the price i would like to see more toppings along with the pork the bowl seemed a bit empty otherwise a great fill,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,it was good the pork cheeks had a lot of fat but were pretty tender the normal pork was a little hard but good the spicy ramen tasted nice and flavorful with enough spice for a kick but it was not overwhelming the large size is actually quite large for singapore and the small size is quite small,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,trying out the amount limited ramen and the pork cheeks really really juicy,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,decided to try this place after seeing so many positive reviews on yelp my honest opinion ramen here is average only there are other better places here the soup ai not the best not salty but also not really tasty pricey too compared to other places,Negative
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,still the best ramen in town order the black pig ramen which meats are separated from the ramen and you wo not be disappointed if you order the other ramens they are comparable to the other ramen joints in town,Positive
hokkaido-ramen-santouka,excellent stuff one of my go to places for a ramen fix,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,gorgeous temple inside and out it is lit up at night per their website but we visited in am i was told to cover my shoulders with a shawl from the pile at the temple entry some had to wear full robe if your shorts or mini skirt are too short the hundreds of buddhas are spectacular people go into pray and one of the monks conducted prayer chanting by microphone while we were there in the rear are buddhas who protect certain astrological signs we wanted to see the tooth relic of prince buddha you have to leave by the front door make a left turn and go downstairs where they serve vegetarian meals looks like a cafeteria at a senior center pass the dining area is an elevator you take upstairs there is a floor with all sorts of statutes including guan yin furniture from the past in display another floor houses the  teeth of buddha allegedly found by his student in buddha is funeral pyre after he died the teeth are in a gold container in a large gold room on the altar all behind glass it is an active prayer and meditation room you go in barefoot and shawls required if you are wearing sleeveless community pile shawls available above the shoe rack tops they do have a photo of the teeth so you can see no photos allowed in here another floor takes you to wax figures of past abbots the figures look so much better than at any wax museum i have seen even the hands have wrinkles from that floor it is a balcony and you can look down on the huge main prayer room on the st level there are drapes which are thin enough you can see through there is a garden floor on the roof not much of a garden but a big chime in a room with a temple worker walking in circle to cause a soft chiming noise the plaques of deceased line the walls up here very quiet and serene if you like to visit temples as much as we do you wo not be disappointed i would love to visit this temple again if we return to singapore,Negative
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,i was in awe of this beautiful temple it was not crowded everyone was respectful and it was quiet as tourists we donated to each temple we visited and paid our respects i am sure the locals may get annoyed by tourists if you visit the tooth relic i believe on the third floor you must take off your shoes it is so peaceful in that room and you can even meditate this temple is exquisite and there is a ton to learn this is a nice and memorable visit for travelers,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,one of the first things we went and saw in singapore due to it being close to our hotel and what a spectacular sight to see the temple was in amazing condition and like everything else in singapore it was clean friendly and inviting just as a note for the ladies if you are wearing shorts higher than your knees or a shirt that exposes your shoulders you will need to put a shaw over your clothing the temple has a bin full of them so you do not have to go out and buy one must see sight it is very calming and peaceful to walk inside and see the temple,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,the temple is filled with beautiful and interesting artifacts and architecture gold is used throughout and makes the temple have a glow to it when you visit make sure to cover your shoulders and legs this applies to women for sure i was given a shawl to cover my shoulders as i had a tank dress on it was amazing to see the hundred buddha statues on the first floor my son and i just stared for a second as our senses were a little overwhelmed then there is an elevator to the fourth floor which is where the tooth is located it is enshrined in an enclosure and close circuit television allows you to look at the tooth was informed no one other than the most senior of monks are allowed into the area i do not know if i believe the tooth belonged to buddha but the temple itself is amazing to visit because we were with a tour we did not have time to properly wander in the temple but our brief visit still left an impression of wonder will have to come again to see the things we missed,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,the temple opened in  and is built in the architectural style of the tang dynasty it houses the tooth relic of the historical buddha which you can view on the rth floor of the temple the temple is beautiful to view by day and by night it is free to enter if your shoulders are not covered you can grab a community shawl available at the entrance in a bin there are numerous floors to explore i recommend starting at the top roof garden and working your way down you can ask anyone at the front for guidance on how to find the elevator to the top floor the temple is ornate and beautiful the roof top garden is serene and peaceful the roof top is home to the ten thousand buddha pavilion inside is a very large vairocana prayer wheel every complete turn of the wheel will toll the wheel bell inside the prayer wheel are more than   copies of the vairocana dharani the temple also is home to a buddhist cultural museum with a vast collection of artifacts,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,really interesting temple and museum the temple sections are beautiful with a prayer garden on the roof the museum sections give a really well done history of the life of the buddha and the birth of the religion very interesting and informative,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,i came here for the tasty cheap food in the basement for a  donation you get rice and get to pick  entrees they are very generous with the portion tasty food and unbeatable price not a bad place for a quick casual meal,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,i love this temple in chinatown smell of jasmine in the air i know it is not proper to take photos but cannot resist its beauty,Negative
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,you have to see this place whether you are buddhist or not this is a must see the temple is absolutely beautiful inside you will find monks chanting many gorgeous statues and beautiful art if you are in chinatown you really should stop by it is free to get in and there is a nice gift shop if you are wearing shorts you will have to cover your legs with a brown apron that is provided,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,really awesome temple there are  floors all of which we were able to go up but i guess sometimes certain rooms are closed depending on the schedule there are lots of really ornate beautiful areas of this temple including the buddha tooth part on the fourth floor i would definitely recommend a stop by here it is also near an excellent hawker center,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,this temple is located in chinatown and is absolutely stunning i only walked through the first floor as it is almost chinese new year so it was quite busy as they were prepping for a special event that evening,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,it is beautiful it is peaceful it is spiritual if you are a traveler like me wanna discover singapore and get epic photos come to this place it is also in chinatown you will find great chinese food as well you wo not be disappointed i promise,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,i probably should have read the yelp reviews before i came in here because it appears that there is much more to this place that the two large temples that i visited down stairs however as i wandered around this building wandering where all of the teeth were because the main reason i came here was because i thought a tooth museum was sort of different and wanted to see all the teeth i do not remember seeing any way up to the upper levels maybe of should have asked with the exception of the doors that the monks where entering and leaving and i certainly was not going to go in there anyway i must admit that the artwork inside this place was nothing short of amazing and i walked around inside just marvelling at all of the statues i should advise that it is a functioning buddhist temple so you will see numerous ceremonies going on inside and for you ladies they do not particularly like you walking inside in shorts or skimpy dresses though the do offer wrap around aprons it is certainly an impressive place to visit if only to admire the artwork as was the case with me,Negative
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,not another  star review look it is hard to argue with this one what am i going to say sorry buddha just not spiritual enough or perhaps hey it is just too expensive i do not think so as it is free of course there are collection boxes for a small donation but you know that you need all the help you can get in the afterlife so that is not going to kill you you cannot complain about it bring too strenuous as an elevator takes you most of the way to the top and when there are stairs they have provided an electronic grandmother chair for those that might not be able to climb oh by the way it is not a carnival ride so do not use unless you absolutely need to do so apparently such shenanigans are frowned upon in singapore yes this is a sight that is often overlooked in singapore but i say that it is a must see i suggest taking the elevator to the top and working your way to the roof garden it is worth it if for nothing more than spinning the giant prayer wheel after that make you way the room housing the tooth relic truly amazing another must see is the room one floor down which tells buddha s life story it was informative and entertaining this is a grata sight i came thinking that i would just spend  minutes but i spent an hour and no neither the electronic chair or the police had anything to do with my length of visit,Negative
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,amazing open to the public buddhist temple with ornate decorations and beautiful sculptures make sure you are not wearing shorts and have your shoulders covered if not dear not as they have a bin of shawls that you can use to cover up also i was told that you are not supposed to step on the door frame so make sure you walk over it not on it we missed the buddha tooth relic supposedly there is an elevator that you take up to the th floor to the museum but we did not see it even without that portion of the temple though it was a great opportunity to see inside a temple and gaze at all of the tradition,Negative
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,this is my mom is favorite temple where she comes almost everyday to help to do flower arrangements other chores for the temple volunteering from her heart soul today i try calling my mom she did not ask my call on the phone home so i get super worry for her so i try calling my mom is favorite temple these people whose there volunteered to help the temple should be full of kindness helpfulness in their heart soul but to my surprise they are not at all that helpful so disappointed not every helpful at all these people needs to have a more open heart soul amitabha,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,beautiful rooftop garden and huge prayer wheel on the top level take the elevator all the way up then work your way down they have a buddhist history museum as well as buddhist art on display finally you get a nice view of the bottom level from the mezzanine be respectful no tank tops or above the knee shorts allowed cover up be quiet and no photos in certain areas,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,absolutely beautiful temple it was the first time for me to enter a buddhist temple so to see their ceremony was also quite interesting for me,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,the outside of this active buddha temple combined with museum appears of a chinese pagoda that sits in the heart of singapore chinatown free admission this temple incorporates elements of chinese tang dynasty of facade structures as the roof for chinese red is spilled in a modern structure in the shadow of the setting sun buddha tooth relic temple and museum depicts very chinese presence of buddhist mandala eminent sangha museum feature life stories of monks in singapore showcasing buddhist arts and culture morning chantings promptly begins at am daily and resident monks adhere a strict vegetarian food diet it immerses one deep into the buddhism life and culture for a better understanding i distinctly remember from my  visit non flash photography is permitted in the buddhist culture museum and eminent sangha museum note photography or filming of any device including mobile phones is strictly prohibited in the sacred relic chamber visitors are to abide in dressing modestly and avoid obscene appearance gentlemen pickup your pants to the waist line at the entrance and ladies no very low cut tops or mini skirts please tranquility is important with respect to the temple and its mission where visitors who are not buddhist nor religious in any shape or form are able to attain inner solace for a moment is peace from today is brutal ever changing world inscriptions are written in english and traditional chinese i like this temple for its beautiful open air garden atrium tourist trap indeed but worth a visit for the foreigner with an open mind,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,buddha tooth relic temple and museum does worth a repeat visit it is located conveniently across from maxwell food centre so there is no excuse of me not dropping by every time when i am in town just going in and walking around admiring the architecture and enjoying a few moment of peace in my heart is worth the visit make sure visit the garden and the bell up on the roof a lot quieter and less crowded there is also the relic buddha tooth and the museum that you can visit aside from the main temple the best is everything is free and you can take as many photos as you want just dress properly but the temple does provide cover up if you are in your shorts and tanks so not to worry,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,after an amazing lunch from tian tian in maxwell food center right across the street we visited the buddha temple from the outside the building is huge and the red and gold painting looked very grandiose when we entered the temple there was a prayer going on but visitors are still allowed to walk inside and pray photography allowed too i was totally mind blown by the grandeur every minute detail was well thought of and decorated the buddha statues are absolutely beautiful and so are the other deities it was just palatial when you are there do not forget to take the elevator to the forth floor and see the tooth relic which is well protected inside a gold shrine behind a glass for visitors to see photography is not allowed here there is space for people to sit and enjoy a silent prayer as well definitely worth the visit,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,this is a very impressive temple right round the corner from the edge of china town this is a must see place but remember not to wear short short as this is still a working temple where people come and worship,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,a beautiful temple that is definitely worth a visit there wo not be anyone there to tell you anything about the place so make sure you read wikipedia or something about it so that you understand the things inside but even just for a casual stroll it is a beautiful place to visit and have some quiet time,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,place of worship where you should have the freedom to see buddha however it is discouraging when you are trying to teach a youngster about buddhism there are too many restrictions in this temple such as covering yourself before entering the temple this place is more for the tourist than the believers i would rather go to bright hill temple where i would feel at ease rather than feeling the tension,Negative
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,this is a beautiful temple in the heart of chinatown the temple is beautiful both from the outside and the inside it is a place for both the believers and tourists and one can admire the beauty of this temple the tooth relic on the top floor is worth the trip the museum is worth the trip too a must see when in the area,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,such an amazing tranquil place even if you are not religious you will still enjoy the beauty of this place you must wear cloths that cover your arms and legs they will provide you with a scarf if you do not have one,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,cool chinese buddhist temple that cost a cool  million to build hundreds of images of buddha in dozens of positions beautifully constructed and kept immaculately clean what i do not understand is how they came to possess the sacret tooth relic of buddha there are several tooth relic temples world wide one in sri lanka several in china one in california one in japan and one in sg how many of buddha is teeth were taken really,Negative
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,a complex built like a tang dynasty architectural style to house the tooth relic of the historical buddha it is situated in chinatown and in a prominent red colour the place not only serve as a temple but also a museum where people who are interested can also visit the place being a buddhist i have been there quite a few times to pray and also get to see the relic at the top floor unlike most of the temple buddha tooth relic temple and museum has explaination beside each statue in english and chinese to let tourist understand there is also a vegetarian food court at the basement serving nice vegetarian food at a low price open for the public,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,to be honest not much to say here as i did not stay long i was wearing a hat and upon entering i was immediately told to remove it oops sorry since i do not wear hats often i forgot it was on i was also told to cover my legs since i was wearing shorts at that point i took it as a sign that i should leave what little i did see showed that this was a beautiful and vibrant temple that was very crowded with visitors and people praying next time i will be sure to wear a long skirt,Negative
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,beautiful place calming and absolutely amazing to walk through during prayer a must see if you are in the area you wo not be sorry,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,huge buddhist temple in the middle of chinatown that houses a relic of buddha is tooth the interior rooms are beautiful and ornate the staff is also very friendly and helpful and let us know about events at the temple do not miss the entire ground floor and the relic room the roof garden and prayer wheel are also very cool,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,if you are wearing short short or tank tops you have to cover yourself before you could go to the temple there is a security guard there to tell you this temple was only built in  newer than all temples i have ever been to there are  floors for you to explore all the ancient artifacts from around the world the th floor is where the buddha tooth is you have to take off your shoes before entering you have to be respectful of their culture and refrain from taking pictures where the sign say no picture,Negative
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,the buddha tooth relic temple and museum is not only a temple for worshippers but a museum so that interested tourists can learn more about buddhism and the various gods some forms of buddhism worship the temple is  storeys high including a very pleasant open air roof garden and a prayer wheel it is pleasant to take a walk or sit there sometimes when you need to escape the hustle and bustle of the city some people might be slightly taken away by the grandness and ostentatiousness of the gold statues and idols and when i first followed my relatives here i was a little put off by it all but i have grown to like it and it is all still very impressive the ground floor is mainly for worshippers to pray with monks chanting in the front hall the museum is located on the second and third floors visitors to the temple should remember to dress appropriately entrance is free but donations are welcome although peaceful if you are seeking a quiet place for longer worship other temples are less distracting and not filled with so many tourists however this place is definitely worth at least one visit,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,beautiful buddhist temple to visit while in chinatown many buddhas figures to view and an impressive multiple stories,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,i really enjoyed our visit we just walked through the main floor but the statues were beautiful best part was there was a gathering of some sort and they were all chanting singing unsure if this is the proper terminology it was almost soothing very neat to see,Positive
buddha-tooth-relic-temple-and-museum,this is a beautiful temple which allows photos inside please wear appropriate clothing cover your shoulders and knees they have sarongs you can use for modesty there is a museum inside as well,Positive
khansama-tandoori,i hiked about  miles from my hotel through little india just to get here and it was so worth the walk there is outdoor seating for milder weather and indoor seating with a c which is a lifesaver if you are here at the height of summer the staff are very friendly and service is pretty fast though i will say that i purposely avoided the busiest hours because i wanted more time to sightsee and shop the food is amazing i know vindaloo is pretty much the most basic boring thing to get at an indian restaurant but the mutton vindaloo was probably the best i have had anywhere this far i like things very spicy and they matched what i asked for which as some of you spice lovers know does not always happen everywhere their naan was delicious and the spiced tea i got it iced was amazing definitely recommended if you are in the area,Positive
khansama-tandoori,probably the best indian food in singapore is their motto and i would have to agree the outdoor patio seating was packed at am so we were escorted to their upstairs lounge looking medieval and historic with brick i was glad we were able to enjoy a late night dinner in this room the food was perfect enjoyed their chicken kebab masala and garlic buttered naan very authentic flavors and was not afraid to use my hands to eat it would have been a perfect experience except for the below average service we were never greeted and had to flag down servers several times to get them to take a drink order i wanted to order another dish but never had the change or opportunity to i would suggest take out or maybe calling ahead to place an order i would definitely come back here when visiting little india and if you have an appetite past midnight they will surely accommodate,Positive
khansama-tandoori,came here for a late lunch on one of those crazy hot days and so thankful that they have a c setup upstairs it is hard for me to commit to just one dish when it comes to indian food so i caved to my cravings and ordered a variety rogan josh baingan bharta chicken tikka biryani and garlic naan yes i did eat it all by myself sauce on the rogan josh was great though would have preferred the mutton to be more tender paired with the fragrant biryani that sauce made a killer combo for carb coma afterwards garlic naan was incredible as well always get it with butter ghee the eggplant was solid but the sauce from the rogan josh stole the show chicken tikka was incredibly tender but thought the season was leaning on the salty side left completely satisfied will be back soon,Positive
khansama-tandoori,solid   stars came here for dinner during the week was pretty crowded even on a tuesday but we managed to get seated pretty quick it reminds you of restaurants in the s in india in a good way we got the hara bhara kebab and aloo tikki chaat to start off with was very tasty especially the kebab had garlic naan and paneer butter masala for mains again very tasty and very fresh i was super impressed and will be back to try their non veg options soon,Positive
khansama-tandoori,fantastic food the flavour superb i will definitely visit again,Positive
khansama-tandoori,the food was very delicious the best indian food i have tried while being in singapore the fish tikka masala had just enough spice the vegetable biryani was flavorful and the honey lemon tea satisfied my quench i will definitely go back,Positive
khansama-tandoori,fantastic food you talk about flavor this food was cooked just right we had the chicken masala and the mutton masala we would definitely have it again also so hot in singapore ask to go upstairs in the air con part of the restaurant,Positive
khansama-tandoori,i am a big fan of eating with my hands not that you have to they are have forks but when you order roti and stuff it with everything in your reach you really do not have a chance this food is delectable we passed by the first time in hope we would find something better maybe and no cigar we walked right back the place is not much to look at they are under construction the chairs are lawn chairs but who cares i am here to chow we had mutton kebab chicken tandoori mutton curry vegetable rice and roti with a side of white sauce just wow spicy delicious savory my mouth is watering i miss it so much the staff is a little stand off ish but once you get their attention they are incredibly nice food is fast we ordered and ate in a half hour bc we had a tour to catch i honestly will miss this place the most,Positive
khansama-tandoori,i am in sin a lot and a freind took me to this place in little india sat on the street corner in red plastic chairs and awaited with a pint of tiger in hand the smells emanating form the area are intense and the waft coming from khansama is hard to describe think pepe le pew floating in the air hooked on a dreaming scent the grilled tandoori chicken samples was just amazing the same  cuts of chicken cooked with  different spices one red one green one yellow green whatever the hell it was was nuts the mixed biryani following was also solid mouthwatering if you want a casual space easy attitude and scrumptious indian food take it for a spin,Positive
khansama-tandoori,delicious food the friendly waiter was patient with me while i stared at their enormous menu and decided on what to get i ordered the mutton kebab masala and chicken biryani both were incredibly flavorful and the meat in both were tender way better than most of the indian restaurants i have had in the u s my only regret is that i came along and i could not order as many dishes and i wanted,Positive
khansama-tandoori,was here for a wonderfully delicious early afternoon lunch upstairs in air conditioned comfortable dining room fantastic menu excellent service and great value highly recommend,Positive
khansama-tandoori,found this place via yelp i recommend to sit in the nd floor for air conditioning this restaurant has outstanding food and service the curry mutton was my favorite dish here the flavor was very rich creamy and extremely flavorful we also ordered other foods and they were also very very fantastic i definitely recommend this place if you are visiting singapore and want to find some delicious indian food but there is a  service charge on the bill,Positive
khansama-tandoori,you think it is a tourist trap or maybe it is but when the food is good i do not care this place is one of the many indian restaurants in little india it is not easy to stumble into the restaurants if you are not looking for it albeit the corner location however the food was lip smacking good we ordered the grilled fish the mushroom tandoori and the pakora starter and washed everything down with good old tiger shortly said i was happy with the food,Negative
khansama-tandoori,this place is in the heart of little india just a  minute walk off the mrt covered outdoor seating makes for a very comfortable experience the food is fantastic and reasonably priced although i would recommend a party of more than one lunch can be pricey if you want to try more than one dish not complaining at all however well worth the higher than usual lunch expense i cannot recommend this place more highly if you find yourself in singapore and you like fantastic indian cuisine do not skip this place,Positive
khansama-tandoori,deep breath tourist trap tourist trap true storyi ordered the koftas   pretty pricey but hey this place is meant to be good right dish arrived and i thought erm here is the sauce where are the koftas dig around with my fork found koftas two yes two looking at waiter erm there is only two koftas here waiter erm that is how we do it i will see if i can get some more returns with one kofta and cuts it it two i sh you not seriously people do yourself a favour walk around the back to around the house of tan tieng grab a masala milk for   a plate of chenna masala for   and enjoy the tranquility and food which is heaps better hey go crazy if you spend  you will get an absolute feast or feed the whole family,Positive
khansama-tandoori,the restaurant claims that it is possibly the best indian restaurant in singapore and this is very possibly true i ordered the curry mutton a low to medium spicy lamb dish full of flavor the meat was tender and the combination of spices very authentic i would avoid the fancier naans and opt for the plain naan instead the garlic naan was a bit drier than i had hoped for,Positive
khansama-tandoori,location this place is located in little india singapore when i came here around early mid april they were doing construction downstairs so it was not a place i would considered just by looking outside i came here through yelp and since i was around the area thought i will give it a try environment service i had to go upstairs since downstairs was constructing so i was told if you know singapore it gets pretty damn hot it was pretty hot upstairs and it was poorly ventilated it is a horrible experience when you are sweating so much yet trying to consume food it was pretty busy due to the area being a tourist friendly area but service was slow and waiters were not attentive their chairs are so heavy and huge which makes it so difficult to even get up to use the bathroom food i tried their chicken curry and their jumbo prawns the chicken curry was okay meat was too dry and was not really my type of curry i had indian food before and it was better their jumbo prawns did not look like prawns and rather more like regular shrimps it was also on the pricier side for mediocre food their menu is like a book a lot of choices but definitely overwhelming if i remembered correctly it was about  pages or more overall i give this place two stars two stars only because maybe other dishes on the menu could have tasted better but i would not know other than that service was not great it was too hot to even move and our food was not that great either,Negative
khansama-tandoori,not usually the biggest indian food lover but wow was this place awesome just happened to stubble upon the restaurant walking down little india everyone ordered something different and we all shared and loved it services super nice will come back best food in sin,Positive
khansama-tandoori,khansma delivers and it is oh so good chicken tikka samosas lassis tandoori chicken biryani rice all are so yummy love being able to call up and have this delivered to my place,Positive
khansama-tandoori,food was excellent service was great and the restaurant was clean recommend chicken tikka masala if you like real spicy and butter milk chocked if you like not so spicy and chicken curry no spicy and for beers kingfisher was awsome,Positive
khansama-tandoori,was expecting more since it was a  star spot got the chicken masala and chicken half kebab there was not any chicken in the chicken masala like  pieces and everything else was sauce and green pepper vegetables lots of seating and friendly staff,Negative
khansama-tandoori,the service could be better it would have been good if the servers are more informative especially to customers who are unfamiliar with the food it would also nice to have a service with a smile that will help to improve the dining experience such a pity as the food is quite good,Positive
khansama-tandoori,we found this gem on yelp the food was amazing and the staff were very attentive and offered some great suggestions i had the chicken tiki marsala and the agoo gomi spelling a vegetable dish with potatoes onions cauliflower tomatoes and curry oh my goodness,Positive
khansama-tandoori,update returned this week and they are still using the table and chairs that makes khansama singapore is most uncomfortable restaurant the sad thing is that the furniture obviously cost them a small fortune it is very detailed and over designed sadly the chairs are so large and the detail on the tables so low that it is impossible to maneuver the chairs under the table two chairs barely sit side by side under the table plastic outdoor furniture would be an improvement tip the waiters are there to upsell you on more than you need be cautious because they have mastered the art of persuasion and do not seem pushy at all they will suggest more than you need unsuspecting ang mohs beware best to order less then order more as you gauge your hunger reducing my rating by one star for the torture chamber devices that they call tables and chairs,Negative
khansama-tandoori,every dish we got was excellent vegetable pakora agra chaat garlic naan fish tikka and aloo matter service was quick and attentive,Positive
khansama-tandoori,nicely decorated and air conditioned upstairs table and chairs are very ornate and clean the mixed chicken tikka is heavenly i ordered it as a starter ended up getting another order together with mutton keema naan and sesame naan made a great tandoori meal half a mutton seekh kebab has sealed the deal defiantly coming back this place is good in the photo comments i could not edit the iphone autocorrecting mutton into mitten,Positive
khansama-tandoori,food is okayishcurrently under renovation hence even air conditioning room is not so cool paneer bhajia and chilli bhajia were good butter chicken was not good service was quick nans were soft and yummy do compare price quantity of beer before you order a mug pitcher bottle and buy the one that is value for money overall just an okayish place,Negative
khansama-tandoori,awesome flavors flavours central little india portion sizes are perfect for sharing great drive menu top notch service,Positive
khansama-tandoori,food and service was amazing i highly recommend this place also a plus that it was air conditioned,Positive
khansama-tandoori,easy to find and well worth the trip to little india food is delicious i had butter chicken which was yummy and had the right amount of spice should have skipped the rice the naan is fabulous,Positive
khansama-tandoori,we went here for lunch on a friday afternoon it was not crowded we were seated upstairs they have two options upstairs has ac and downstairs just fans it was a hot and humid day in singapore so we decided to sit upstairs they have a lot of items in their menu it will take you sometime to go through it to make a choice we ordered starters and main course food was good but it was pricey service was quick and the place was clean but nothing fancy,Positive
khansama-tandoori,delicious dishes and beautifully decorated located in the middle of little india waiters were very attentive and helpful in explaining the diversity of dishes we are very impressed and for sure we will come back,Positive
khansama-tandoori,first let me say that the food is wonderful but the service needs cpr the waiter never smiled and i had to flag him down for water even though he passed me several times seeing an empty glass on the end of the table it seemed as if he was too busy flirting with the waitress to take care of the customers truly this is my only complaint but it was definitely aggravating like i said the food was wonderful and i will probably order delivery from now on from them definitely order the king prawns if you go there you wo not be disappointed,Positive
khansama-tandoori,i am a regular at khansama ever since i moved to singapore about a year ago this is my happy place i go here every weekend and atleast twice during the week the food authentic yummy delicious north indian food you will not be disappointed my favorite order here is the chicken tikka masala with some kulcha the meat is always done just right lots of flavor in portions that are not too large and are not too small a portion of curry here would serve two people just about recommend non vegetarian chicken tikka masala mutton biryani king prawnsvegetarian dal makhnibreads masala kulcha rumali rotithe service the staff is very friendly contrary to other reviews here just set up a conversation and remember that this is a very popular restaurant that is packed to the limit almost everyday so they are bound to be a little busythe chairs oh gawd this is the worst part they are not comfortable at all no matter what size you are there is no clearance between the chair and the table so it is a really awkward way to sit the food makes it up for everything though price a typical meal for one here without alcohol comes to sgd   remember to pay with nets which is a state controlled payment method that has no fees compared to visa which will tack on a few more dollars,Positive
khansama-tandoori,an evening of exploring lead me to this place of which i can say i ate one of the best indian meals i have ever had you can sit inside or out on the street i chose the latter and ordered a beer while i waited for my order to come the food came quickly some mixed vegetable pakoras mutton vidaloo and naan wowzer the flavours were spectacular and the customer service was amazing i topped it all off with gulab jamun the traditional indian desert out of all of the places i ate when i was in singapore i will be going back here asap totally totally worth it,Positive
khansama-tandoori,a fantastic restaurant with wonderful spicy food the service is fast efficient and spot on you will not regret taking the time to try this place out,Positive
khansama-tandoori,so far my fav restaurant in little india i have been here a couple of times and will be back for more anything from the tandoori oven is great as well as lamb dishes and the dal makhani rice biriani also good butter chicken may be the only thing so far that was just meh about the venue i have to say that the fact that there are no windows in the upstairs room is a bit strange,Positive
khansama-tandoori,excellent quick service i had so many people waiting on me at the rush hour i was amazed the food was great and i even ordered more to take home with me i tried the mutton curry and it was excellent i ended up bringing some chicken home with me and it was awesome i definitely will be eating at this place again,Positive
khansama-tandoori,yes yes yes yes yes the spice the flavours the bustling outdoor seating the naan oh god the naan it was like each and every dish they brought out was better than the last the menu was a feast in itself i knew it would be bad read really freaking good when there were  types of naan to choose from but it got to the point where we were all just pointing and shouting and gesticulating wildly as for the dishes that i dug into the chicken tikka masala was dark rich and spicy and the kadahi prawn was easily the best prawn dish i have ever had but the real stand out was the super decadent chicken mughlayee it was one of those situations where we wanted everything we saw going out to tables around us so i doubt you will go wrong we were a bit surprised with the relatively high prices and rather slow food service waiters were attentive but it just took a reeeeeally long time for our food to arrive but the second the food came out all was forgiven and forgotten all i can remember now is the food korma i had for the next several hours,Positive
khansama-tandoori,the worst delivery service ever possible in addition the attitude of the staff is worst i have come across they promise to deliver within  mins and it does not even arrive in  hours they have the audacity to say please cancel the order no concerns for the customer whatsoe,Negative
khansama-tandoori,unattentive on the verge of being rude but that might just be their regular everyday attitude aside from that really good food,Positive
khansama-tandoori,very good tandoori chicken that goes great with the strong indian beer haywards  this is how the food is cooked back in a tandoori restaurant in india very good mughlai pasanda better than the usual butter chicken which is good in itself good indian food like the one in india reasonable pricing too,Positive
khansama-tandoori,this is a review of a dinner date at khansama tandoori tinyurl com amlyusthis is actually my second visit to khansama i thought i had previously reviewed it i uploaded the photos but i must have forgotten to write the review i will focus my review on my most recent visit khansama offers street side outdoor seating and indoor seating upstairs the outdoor seating was mainly full the restaurant does use staff on the street working very diligently and trying to get customers to eat there tinyurl com ajamvgthe indoor seating area is quite beautiful it is an odd combination though the room is very ornate the table tops are some type of granite or faux granite but the chairs and the plates are plastic the first seat i sat in basically gave way luckily i did not spill onto the floor on this evening the indoor seating area was mainly empty tinyurl com batzcxthe staff was friendly professional and efficient they are very attentive and helpful the order is quickly taken the food comes out quite fast they did insure there was a little staging with the starters versus the appetizers but like most indian restaurants this is a relatively fast paced meal i thought the food was pretty good my dinner companion thought that it was a bit spicy this included some dishes that are not necessarily usually on the hot side i expect it from a chicken vindaloo but not necessarily from a prawn masala i actually did not find it that spicy though the starters were all quite good i thought the vegetarian samosas noor eh elahi and vegetarian pakora were delicious and also offered nice crisp textures i was less fond of the paneer pakora but that is primarily a person taste issue tinyurl com baswqtinyurl com bepcbtinyurl com axcwkxfor mains to share i selected chicken vindaloo and prawn masala for mains to share she selected palak paneer and palak chicken she thought she had ordered only one dish the ordering was pretty frenzied so i am not sure i thought the food was very good lol i especially enjoyed my two selections the vindaloo was spicy the chicken was tender the potatoes were well prepared for the prawn masala the shrimp was also tender and the dish came together quite well i only dabbled a bit with her spinach laden selections of course we also had saffron rice and naan plain and garlic i thought the rice was spot on the naan was only average the garlic naan just did not seem to have that super freshly cooked garlic flavour that really makes great garlic naan great tinyurl com azureceipt   you cannot really beat getting that much food for  tinyurl com azuwe had way too much food and unfortunately neither of us are doggy bag people so we left a lot of food on the table that was a shame i thought it was some pretty good indian food overall i like the room the service was good i thought the quality of the food was consistently there i do not think my friend enjoyed it nearly as much for me it was a solid   stars but i rounded up another note my first experience was very much in line with my second visit,Positive
khansama-tandoori,this place is popular among tourists and has really great paneer dishes   would visit again,Positive
khansama-tandoori,food was good and price was not bad we ordered x naan vegetable samosa tikki butter chicken and mutton masala and it was just below  butter chicken was a bit too sweet and masala was a bit too salty and naan came in cold though overall verdict taste amount price atmosphere,Positive
khansama-tandoori,we had the samosa butter chicken sauce garlic naan and butter roti and everything was delicious the decor is pretty traditional with givers crowd,Positive
khansama-tandoori,mom and i went in for an early dinner while here in singapore we were seriously craving some good indian food well we found it the kahali prawns and curry chicken were delicious perfectly spiced good sized portions the naan bread was good too the server however was not very friendly at all no smiles had to flag him down constantly but maybe after our week in the land of smiles thailand it was more noticable lol,Positive
khansama-tandoori,made a walk down to little india and stopped at khansama tandoori for a bite to eat with friends the butter chicken lamb rogan josh tandoori chicken samosas lamb boti kebab and chicken tikka masala were all amazing also should point out it was the most reasonably priced meal we had all week and it was the best a couple heineken and a curry does it get much better than that atmosphere was awesome sitting on the patio with all of the activity of the streets of little india around you,Positive
khansama-tandoori,upon searching yelp for a good indian restaurant in the area the family and i stumbled upon this place and boy what a great find on a thursday night amazingly flavorful perfect amount of spice and so much bang for your buck i highly recommend this place to anyone craving solid northern indian food in the area and beyond highlights included the mixed vegetable pakora prawn masala chicken tikka and the heavenly crispy buttery light butter naan,Positive
khansama-tandoori,eaten here on two separate trips both time the food was very good and nice staff sitting on the street sunday afternoon watching the people very relaxing,Positive
khansama-tandoori,fantastic restaurant in almost every way we stopped in here after some diwali shopping and were happy to escape the heat and crowds by heading upstairs to the air conditioned dining room,Positive
khansama-tandoori,we are americans living in singapore we decided to have our thanksgiving dinner at khansama tandoori because we are very thankful for indian food and we have heard good things about this restaurant when we first arrived our server seemed a little unfriendly but he warmed up to us i could not remember what palak paneer was called but he knew as soon as i described it and added it to our order we also tried the butter chicken the assorted tandori and the butter and cheese naan breads everything was delicious and the atmosphere was comfortable clean and very nicely decorated there is also a fairly well stocked bar as well as a descent house white wine i would happily recommend this restaurant and only suggest that you prepare to leave very full,Positive
khansama-tandoori,nothing great just average food service was very good ac is not effective unless you are sitting right next to it they have a desert cooler in the same hall not sure how ac is suppose to work with water cooler in the same room one is a humidifier and other dehumidifier saw good reviews so decided to try but was a bit disappointed,Negative
khansama-tandoori,the food is good especially the kebabs however a special mention has to be the chicken roll they are authentic and remind me of the rolls found in new delhi a must have here,Positive
khansama-tandoori,a place that has wicked kebabs and butter chicken this the best kebab place i know in singapore all of their dishes are pretty rich and fattening with lots of butter and good stuff however i must confess between my second last trip and my last trip i did feel like the quality of the food went down while the price went up i might have gone on the wrong day however i am generally a big fan of the quality of food here the prices are not too cheap the staff is friendly and the ambience is pretty nice,Positive
khansama-tandoori,awesome food tandoori perfect amount of spice curry excellent and service was great from usa so owner was extremely helpful with what to order,Positive
khansama-tandoori,to notch north indian cuisine had the tandoori chicken pakoras mushroom mataar and a tomato based shrimp dish forgot the name sorry all was superb warning though i ordered this sour and salty herbal drink out of curiosity it was described as a digestive drink it is a very acquired taste aka it tastes awful be warned,Negative
khansama-tandoori,the food is great but it is pricey and the waiting times ruin the fun be prepared to wait   mins for food to be served even an extra bread could be an extra  mins,Positive
khansama-tandoori,food was very good the chicken masala was overdominated by green peppers which neither of us enjoyed the butter chicken rice and naan were excellent,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the world is first michelin hawker stall we always try to get to one michelin restaurant each year so why not stop here at the cheapest one i never thought i would pay under  usd for a michelin meal they have multiple locations but we wanted to go to the original one that was awarded inside of the chinatown food complex even though there is one right across the walkway in an air conditioned building we lined up right before they opened and we were still about th in line it took about  minutes to get to the front and order our food but they do have a good system in place to keep the line under control we chose the soy sauce chicken rice and roasted pork rice plates you can add extra sauce or spicy chili on the side once you get your meal the portion is pretty generous considering we only paid a whomping   sgd the chicken was so tender and the roasted pork had a perfectly crunchy outer skin and tender inner meat,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the cheapest michelin star meal in the world only   sg for their signature soya sauce chicken rice meal it is good filing and cheap what more can i say oh yes go early long lineups there we showed up before they opened at am and there was already a long loop around lineup you must try this,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,delicious especially the chicken with noodles the noodles have absorbed the soy sauce which made the noodles more savoury chickens were smooth and tender i did not expect street food could have good quality of food there was a long line up so if interested please go early to avoid long line ups,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,liao fan hawker chan is arguably the most hyped food stall on the planet and i found that especially after waiting a solid forty minutes in line that the execution did not quite add up to the hype especially given there is such strong competition in the area star  how were the service and atmosphere i am told the lines at hawker chan can easily exceed an hour so i will consider myself lucky that on a saturday at lunch i only waited forty minutes once you are front and center the woman working the counter is especially sweet and you will have you dishes in only a few minutes star star  how were the portions relative to the cost unable to decide between the flagship soy chicken rice and the char siew noodle i opted for both which combined were only about  sgd that is insanely cheap and some of the best value you l find anywhere in the world star stars  and  how was the food honestly both these dishes were just okay and i was surprised to find that i like the char siew much better than i did the chicken rice even if you do not get a full or have chicken the chicken rice is more or less bone in which necessitates quite a bit of work while eating from there the white rice was just okay the char siew was much better but even those noodles fell a bit short single star star  would you be excited to go back there are simply too many amazing food stalls for me to recommend the wait for hawker chan no star,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,liao fan hawker chan i salute you for serving the most affordable michelin star meal on the planet i came here during brunch hours and the line was not too crazy there were probably twenty people ahead and the wait was less than half an hour what i ordered soya chicken so delicious this is the real deal that sweet soy sauce flavor smothered on the chicken as well as on the rice makes you want to have wings and fly the egg and the cucumber served on the side also complements the taste from being boring best of all the price is unmatched with any other cuisines in the city for only  singaporean dollars this place is worth the trip,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,biggest disappointment we arrived at the original location to find a line of only about  people score we ordered both the chicken and rice and chicken and noddles  total you could not go wrong but it did my first couple of bites were loaded with tiny bones the flavors were lacking after adding hot sauce the meal because slightly bearable but this was one of the worst meals we have had on our trip to date one we were the most excited about looking back a majority of the reviews and articles of this hawker dated back to   maybe they are past their prime or the new ownership name changed things up on the flip side my husband is chicken was tender and mostly bone free however significantly lacking flavor note we arrived around   an hour before they were closing not as if that should of impacted anything,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i am sure this hawker stall use to be an amazing local gem in its prime days signs of a red flag when the signage says formerly liao fan and the original owner is not there working the stalls is when you know something has probably changed i thought the food was just okay your typical hong kong bbq food no different than something you would get at sam woo back in the states i decided to wait in line because there was a short line of about   people but the pace of the line moved like snails took roughly about  mins to get my plate of soya sauce rice with added roasted pork all in all nothing to rave home about i would not recommend anyone to wait in line even for the curious foody just pick another hawker stall with a small line in front of it and i am sure you will get the same type of hk bbq,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,well i would say my family agrees it is well deserved and true to it is reputation it is a rare one star michelin rated   dining icon we had a whole soy sauce chicken noodles with cha sil  sides of rice wow but wow za super tenter and tasty chicken cha sil was good but a tiny portion rice was fine prices here were higher than at the original hawker stall however yesterday was sunday and the stall was closed we have dined at the stall before and with it is lower prices and open air hot humid atmosphere it is discounted accordingly why  stars are you joking nope it is fabulous,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,what in tarnation these were the only three words that rang through my head as i sank my teeth into the food at liao fan hawker chan i was in disbelief an incredibly excellent michelin starred meal that cost what seemed like mere pennies and peanuts the hype here is real unbelievably succulent meats and flavor packed carbohydrates at ungodly prices i ordered the soya sauce chicken rice and the roasted pork noodle and my taste buds still have not returned from their vacation to deliciousville what in tarnation what in tarnation,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,when i came to singapore i knew i had to stop by the world is cheapest  michelin star restaurant we got to the chinatown complex around  am but the stall did not open until  am then i found out that they opened an actual storefront across the street while yelp lists that that one opens at am it actually also opens at   wanting to eat at the og location we went back into the chinatown complex and waited on the line for the stall to open we were about  on the line and we showed up about  min before opening by the time she opened the shop there were about  people waiting on the line once opened the line moved fairly quickly and surprisingly orderly they menu was pretty limited you could order soy sauce chicken their speciality and claim to their michelin star roasted pork and bbq pork there may have been other items but i only saw those three on this day you can get them by themselves or with rice or egg noodles a plate of chicken or pork over rice or noodles is   singaporean dollar dirt cheap half a soy sauce chicken is  and whole is  we ordered half a chicken and char siew pork over rice the chicken was really really good the seasoning was delicious not too salty or too sweet just the right amount of spices it was also super tender next we tried the char siew pork we thought the pork looked burnt but wanted to try it anyway and oh my god are we glad that we did the char siew pork was the best char siew pork either one of us have ever eaten the outer crust had a slightly charred caramelized layer that is crunchy when you bite down the middle consists of a perfect balance of lean to fats to add tenderness and flavor we were blown away by how good it was i think the real star is the char siew pork and if i had to choose one i would pick the char siew pork over the soy sauce chicken the following day we went back to try the store front location the storefront prices are double what the hawker stall prices are one plate of chicken pork with rice or noodles is about  still a huge bargain for a michelin starred restaurant but the prices are different and i thought i should mention it i presume the higher prices go toward the higher cost of rent for this larger location and also ac and more staff i ordered the char siew pork over noodles this time and skipped the chicken the portions appear slightly larger than the one we received from the hawker stall but still not a huge portion the char siew was also not as good as the one we had across the street the day before it was not as charred or caramelized it was good but not mind blowing if you have a chance to visit here i would highly recommend eating at their original hawker stall over the newer restaurant,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the cheapest michelin star worldwide note that one restaurant in the food center is closed on mondays so you can expect a slightly longer line on mondays the total wait until you get your food is around  minutes rice with roasted chickenthe chicken is really tasty and for s  you literally pay nothing for it but do not be fooled the portion of the chicken is so little that it is more snack than a meal therefore i recommend to go with the half chicken it is a better value and the chicken tastes better as they cut it differentlyhalf roasted chicken just get this one dcoconut water for s   you cant go wrong super tasty and sweet better than those in hawker centervegetables nothing special if you feel guilty of having too much meat this might be an option otherwise skip itpapaya soup this is a dream for fobi local chinese people but was nothing for me german american asian this is more something my parents would probably enjoy d,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,perhaps the cheapest michelin starred meal you can get anywhere a plate of soy sauce chicken over noodles at hawker chan located in a chinatown hawker center costs just   the lines for this place can be massive and we had to wait about  minutes on a saturday morning the chicken here comes with a delicious savory sauce kind of like sa cha and you can add on a chili dipping sauce for a bit of spice we also tried the char siu or chinese barbecue pork which was lean sweet and savory the bed of white rice made for a perfect medium to soak up the sauce and the beans on the side added some nice texture was it worth the price definitely but i cannot say that i would necessarily wait again in line just to have this a second time,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,stumbled upon hawker chan after doing some research on food spots in singapore overall its not the typical hawker stall experience as it is in a building and well kept in terms of food i got the standard soya sauce chicken and tofu appetizer the chicken was delicious i live in chinatown ny and definitely cannot get better chicken there than in singapore the skin on the chicken just has this texture that is unbelievable oily and slippery yet hearty and firm the chicken was delicious highly highly recommend this joint mmmm sogoooo,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,now this might be the most famous hawker stall in singapore it was definitely on my list of must try eating well before we went there maybe the fame has as much to do with the fact that the soya chicken and rice is only slightly more than   a plate and there is a half hour line to get it it was yummy of course but i think i actually liked hainanese chicken rice better never the less this place is an icon and worth the trip we also had the char siew with rice and i think i liked it better you really cannot go wrong here that is for sure,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,cheapest michelin star in the world this serves hk style roast chicken and rice the soy sauce chicken is juicy and tender but is it thattt good i do not think so definitely above average but not particularly standout the rice is just ok as well although not as famous as the soy sauce chicken they serve pretty good barbecue pork with noodle here would recommend getting a set with both chicken and bbq pork so you can try bothnear the original stall in chinatown they now open an air conditioned restaurant nearby,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i guess i understand why this place was awarded its michelin star the food is genuinely delicious for a hawker stand it is extraordinary but at the end of the day it is still hawker stand food it is simple no frills and served up with plastic utensils i think the general consensus is that the food would be more impressive if there was not any preconception associated with the michelin star but i doubt the owner is complaining,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,as a starter we wanted to visit the original hawker stall which is literally across the street from the store front but the entire complex is undergoing renovation until june st i can only speak on the storefront it is not lost on me or i assume anyone else that i waited in the line with that we were all here for the same experience critically acclaimed cheap food through a bunch of youtube news outlet click spirals i discovered this place am glad to have had the opportunity to try the food here the mechanics we got here around  to discover the  smith street complex was undergoing renovation until june st went to the storefront and the line extended to the door but luckily not outside you get your receipt with a number and there are a few tv screens that list your order number and when it is ready the restaurant takes credit card we ordered  dishes the awarded hong kong soya sauce chicken the pork char siu siew hk soya sauce chicken very very good the meat was mostly tender and the sauce was a right combo of savory and sweet a few pieces were a touch dry but all in all for sgd   it is worth going to for this alone and waiting there might be better there might be worse but at least i have a good base to compare other versions of this dish my one regret is not ordering the half chicken but perhaps on another visitpork char siew holllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy hellllllll yo this was bomb com gov edu the char siew was tender with the great ratio of meat fat and caramelization of the outside if the one at the og stall is even better i do not know if i can handle it noodles my goodness so good some of the better noodles i had they enhanced the proteins we ordered good by itself good in the sauce it was in good with any combo of items i put in there in short this entire bill was less than   usd for an experience that i hope to repeat in the future a michelin star increases the focus on this restaurant and i get the immediate sense that the expectations on this place are heightened it is cheap it is very tasty and if there are better versions of these items at another place or just better at this location i hope to try it sometime soon,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,reposting my review here from the previous yelp page that now says closed despite it only having a name change this review is for the actual liao fan hong kong food stall now known as hawker chan instead of the hawker chan restaurant which opened after the michelin star was earned yelp is a bit confusing in that reviewers are posting reviews for both locations on multiple businesses which all have different addresses the food stall is located on the second floor of the chinatown complex which is across the street from the air conditioned sit down restaurant the reason i chose to eat at the stall is because the prices are cheaper and the food is supposedly better also if i am going to come all the way here it is better to eat at the original right especially since hawker chain restaurant chains are now popping up all over the world the soya sauce chicken noodle is the dish that earned this place a michelin star at the stall it is s   super cheap for a michelin star meal i also ordered a char siew rice which was also   there are some other menu items that also looked delicious like the soya sauce chicken rice roasted pork rice and the chicken hor fun most dishes are s  and under let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good the chicken was very tender and juicy the noodles were cooked well i love that they poured their delicious sauces all over my plate was it amazing i am not sure there are a lot of other stalls in the area serving the same exact dish and most of them are also really delicious i am not sure what makes the chicken stand out the char siew however was really good i liked it more than the chicken overall i think my expectations were too high because of this place is popularity and its star the only reason we came here was to try the cheapest michelin star meal in the world i am not sure if i would come here again and wait in the really long line comparing this place to other one michelin star restaurants i would give it a four star good food at a very cheap price comparing this place to other hawker stalls i would give it a five star,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,soya chicken rice is very delicious and for the price of   usd sgd it makes it even better although this is comparable to some of the chicken rice spots you can obtain at hawker stalls the building that provides a number of amenities such as bathroom and napkins makes eating here much more enjoyable lines are not terrible and everyone is here to get the world is cheapest michelin star restaurant well worth the visit i would every time i am back in singapore,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,for quite the long line i came as it was just opening on a weekday and the line was already quite long and the fact that this place has a michelin star i was expecting so much more i had the chicken and rice and honestly the only good part about it was the chicken and even that i felt was lacking the chicken itself was cooked really well and i thought it was roasted quite nicely unfortunately that is where the benefits end the seasoning was quite mediocre it tasted a little bland in some place the rice was terrible and low quality tasting the sauces and accompaniments taste like the typical items you can get from any other average hawker stand the good part though is that the price was super low at around  a plate it was a steal but unfortunately a low price does not justify the wait and i guess my expectations coming in were too high because of the michelin star,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,had their chicken rice chicken noodle and chashao rice today for lunch the line was long but we waited anyway for about  minites in line since it was a michelin one star this is what i thought of this place and food we are visiting for  days and out of so many good food in singapore we chose this place as one of our meals and i felt like it was not worth the wait and for one of the precious few meals of singapore it is nice that it only costs about  dollar each plate but for us we were looking for something more tasty i guess so if you are expecting a real decent and quality good taste this is not the place the chicken rice was not bad at all but was it worth waiting so long and worth eating at a food court in china town where it was so crowded and hot i am not sure i mean if it was exceptionally good which i kind of hoped it to be i would totally and happily eat at even worse environment but it just was not that good i wish we had picked some other place where we can sit with ac and some decent food with more choices and service i gave it a three star because the food was just okay tasting it was not what i saw from the reviews at least for me personally,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,definitely a touristy spot for the hype and there is almost always a line that takes around  minutes i like that the new menu lists which options have lower calories my favorite is probably the soya chicken with egg noodle instead of rice as famous as the soya chicken is there is just too much bone to meat i would actually come back for the roasted pork rice and char siu over rice since there is a generous amount of meat and it really hits the spot for both tasty and cheap,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,fan most affordable michelin star eatery in the world chicken was soft and flavourful soya sauce is sweet and savory sambal and hot sauce accompanying the dish added another level of flavour my favourite dipping sauce is sweet jalapeno vingear line up was surprisingly short highly recommend stopping by at odd hours to avoid queue best  you can spend,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the chicken is tender moist and just the right amount of salty the char siu is sweet and supple and the rice with gravy on top is just the perfect vehicle for chicken and pork all that for s   it really has earned the right to be named the cheapest michelin star meal i wo not get into the merits and hype that comes with a michelin rating but be assured it is worth the wait if you are going to have one meal in singapore i would suggest this one,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,how could i say no i heard about hawker chan through a friend who raved about it i decided to go with her and storm through the crowded chinatown to get her favorite dish they received their award in  which was the year i was there was i excited of course let is talk food the chicken truly is delicious but what makes it even more delectable is the rice and the sauce the chicken is glazed in some sort of sauce that pretty much seeped through the soft chicken skin every bite mixed with the rice is just heaven to top it off the pork dish is delightful too it is the perfect consistency of fat and meat the egg sprouts on the side just compliments the entire ensemble verdict this is a true michelin cheap yet delicious,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,for the price nothing can beat this delicious meal their famous chicken with rice is really good i would not say it changed my life but it was one of the heartiest meals i have had you can tell that the owner has put love and care into his craft the flavours and textures are all well balanced nothing tough or out of place all the rice cooked well i would stick to the classic chicken and rice the noodles were average,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,yummy soy sauce chicken rice chicken is super tender and the sauce is just right the best in singapore,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,had a chance to try this place first thing in the morning and took the chance to be first in line ordered the classic soya sauce chicken with rice though i regret not getting the noodles as i hear they are great it costs   sgd which is an epic price increase from the previously   sgd when it was in it is hawker stand vs it is own restaurant the soya sauce chicken was really damn good and the portion size was pretty decent i wish i came back for seconds but had to hit up the other awesome food in singapore would come back but would not wait in line and then complain about it like some of the others,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,my first food hawker center on this trip cuz i wanted to try the cheapest  star michelin restaurant in the world this is just the stand the sit down restaurant is across the street was gonna get the roast pig w rice cuz i am not a huge soy sauce chicken fan but decided to go for the chicken cuz that is their signature item glad i did cuz the chicken was so smooth and tasted really yummy super satisfying and dang cheap too even in the late afternoon there was still a queue but it went really fast,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,truly the best soy sauce chicken i have eaten we arrived at around   am on saturday morning and found people who were congregating around a queue but had not yet started to queue the stand opens at   am and by   people were starting to queue the queue begins across from the stand and snakes around the other stands i like the fact that they call customers up one by one so that you do not feel rushed or jostled while you are ordering we got our food by   or so so not a bad wait at all we ordered half a chicken and one order of soy sauce chicken over rice along with a side of veggies for good measure the chicken even the white meat is velvety tender and juicy which is challenging to find the soy sauce sauce is the right balance of sweet and salty i saw a number of locals getting the chicken with rice but i am a purist and like it with rice as we were leaving at around   the line was only a little bit longer than when we first started standing in line at   but i heard it gets unmanageable by  pm,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,amazing chicken and soy sauce rice at a great price tried this for the first time today waited for about  minutes in line which is apparently short given normal weekend circumstances my friend and i got two chicken and soy sauce riced and a stir fried vegetable dish for only  the sign said this is a michelin starred restaurant and while it is not glamorous it is tasty would recommend coming just to try it at least once you wo not regret it,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this was one of the must try food stall that vloggers have mentioned it is michelin rated it opens at   am and we were relieved when we got there right when it opened to think there was no long line as anticipated oh boy we were wrong the place has not even opened yet and the line has already wrapped around the corner since we thought that we had to fall in line for this very anticipated hawker food we must try all the great options so we had the chicken with noodles charsiu rice and roasted pork rice all three were delicious but my favorite and the most flavorful of all was the charsiu pork with rice i would fall in line all over and buy a bunch just for the charsiu of all the hawker food stalls and we tried many this was the most delicious and a must come back to for me by pm when we returned around the area the stall was already closed and the sign sold out was up while many stalls are still open,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,best soy chicken i have ever eaten super moist and tender the sauce was very flavorful but i added the sweet chili peppers for an extra pop had two chicken dishes breast with rice and thigh with noodles have to get both of them together if you want a complete meal i am not sure if it is the cooking technique or type of chicken used or both but i have not tasted a similar quality in america already thinking of plans for return visit,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,ok so if you are visiting singapore this is a must stop come here to the original stall location if you can instead of the air conditioned restaurant location we tried both and this stand is much better so we came in morning at am half an hour before they opened there was a stand and we waited behind a few other people once they opened we got the full soy sauce chicken and combo cha sew over rice chicken was so moist and flavorful it was cooked and seasoned perfectly we also got some veggies book choy the price cannot be beat awesome food and i do not even know how they can stay in business charging so little,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the chicken and chau siew are both good but not something that you must have the service is ok and ladies distributing the food is pretty loud and rude,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,there are  hawker chan is this one is the stand in the chinatown food court the other one is across the street and is a sit down place with ac after a mediocre experience with the brick and mortar store decided to give the stand a try to see if it really is better waited in line foreverrr it took about  min til i got to the front of the line to put in my order started waiting in line at about   am on a friday ordered the soya chicken and rice as well as the veggie dish both were good was it better than the brick and mortar store yes the rice was better and not cold and hard like at the other location was it worth the wait i do not think so but glad i gave it a shot,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i came here because of the cheap michelin star chicken like everyone else we ordered the signature chicken with rice ho fun with chicken and the veggies we spent about  bucks and it was delicious if i could do it again i would get a whole chicken and veggies i would definitely come back if i am around again,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,great cantonese bbq award winning for michelin one star on the soya chicken,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,good food but nothing that will blow your mind we waited in line for about  minutes and had the chicken and pork the chicken was good and i liked the sauce i actually preferred the pork the rice was just rice nothing special for being a michelin star restaurant i expected to be wowed with the flavors and i really was not it tasted like food stall food good but not amazing it is very cheap though,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this is my first michellin star experience and oh boy it was definitely worth it the line was pretty long but not as bad as you think it would be for a michellin restaurant this is not the original location but one of the other brick mortar locations i had so many similar dishes at home and i thought to myself what could possibly be so different the answer is a lot of things first off is the pricing you can get an entire meal for less than  usd which is a steal the signature dish is the soya chicken the chicken was extremely flavorful and the sauce is subtle the chicken falls right off the bone and that is when you know you got some high quality meat next up is the triple pork platter which was basically chinese bbq pork cooked in three different ways honestly i like this better than the soya chicken it is hard to explain and put into words but trust me it is a beautiful explosion in your mouth,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,how did i forget to review this spot first taste of soya sauce chicken was a revelation so much nuance in how the different spices flavors came together it is not any ordinary soya sauce chicken had a bit of the crispy pork as well which was also a thumbs up i was tempted to come here several times throughout my stay but managed to discipline myself to try other places but yes i would come back in a heartbeat,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,the michelin star dish soya chicken was bomb the first word out my mouth after the first bite was wow i do not think i have ever had chicken so soft and juicy before such simple flavors but so delicious no sauce needed at all dining in is rough because it is always packed no host to seat you down so you have to look and hunt down a table quickly i stood at a table for like  min waiting for them to finish up so i can grab it for my friends and i food is definitely worth the wait,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,family vacation delicious food we at chan is food twice already and today we are going again before our departure definitely recommend chan is dishes,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,it is true this place is a must go to place when you are in singapore the price is very affordable we ordered the famous soya chicken and it is so good i could eat it all week long if i need to it was worth the hour long wait,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,well worth the wait in line in a sea of food options in chinatown there is a reason why this stands out i had my fill of pork belly and the sauce is sweet and unique compared to other plates i had in the area when you decide to go get there early because the wait will be at least   minutes,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,amazingly tasty simple meal highly recommend the char siu with rice along with the soya chicken there was a line at am but it was easily worth the wait most plates are around  singaporean,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,had to check out this highly raved about chicken and rice spot passed by earlier in the day and was discouraged by the long line came back at p and there was barely a line soya chicken and rice was good but i did not think it was michelin star ahh maz ing glad i did not have to wait in the long line i felt like the soy sauce flavor could have come out stronger than it did in the chicken,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,yet another michelin star restaurant on this foodie trip soy sauce chicken with noodles a side of wonton soup and tiger beer it did not let us down at what is rated the cheapest michelin star restaurant in the world,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i went there for lunch with my family i went here because of the michelin starred signs the place was nice and cozy i ordered the seasonal vegetable which is good half chicken was okay because i prefer to have the boneless chicken and the sauce was just okay nothing special thats why i gave  stars thai style tofu was okay the  combination platter was good conclusion recommended,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,for the flavor and rice i am definitely a fan the price was very nice as well rice was nicely cooked and sauced which is how i like it the chicken itself was good but the star was the char siew pork it was crispy outside with lots of flavor and just melted when you put it in your mouth pork ribs were not bad but the ones i got were a bit jerky like just seemed to have been cooked too long or hung to long after also really liked his side sauce little bit of sweet hot going on was a bit addictive and went on everything,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,star michelin yada yada yada i do not need to go on and on about the hype of hawker chan i do not exactly know what it takes to get a michelin star but here is what i do know go early moreso do not go at the end of day as you risk them running out this happened on our first attempt on my second attempt i went on a saturday around am and was pretty surprised there was not much of a line this changed about an hour later when i was leaving though they are famous for their soya chicken there are so many options i almost feel like i should not write this review until i have tried more than one dish i had the soya chicken with rice the dish was   and extra  to choose my part i chose breast waited about  mins not bad the chicken was indeed very flavorful as was the rice however in hindsight i wold have gotten the thigh or leg the breast was a little dry for me and there was not much skin or sauce to moisten the meat my fault i went by myself if i went with others we could have had more dishes to try out rest assured i will be coming back here again if i get to go back,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,i am gonna say this is not worth the michelin star it is good but not that good i ordered a plate of soya chicken with noodles and waited about  mins on a weekday when i got the plate my noodles were already cold dry and clumped together the cut of chicken i had was the rear boney part near the chicken butt and did not have much meat to it i liked the spicy sauce they have on the side table and the little bit of sauce they smeared on the plate next to the noodles too the flavor was good but i just do not see how this beats other cantonese options the  plate is also a pretty small portion many people order a side of vegetables or other cuts of meats to make it a whole meal this is definitely not something i would go back for,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this place is a michelin star hawker stand and i have had the chicken and pork here and both were excellent it gets packed in here but the food is very cheap and good,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,after it gotten its michelin hawkwer star for being the cheapest priced in the world i think hawker chan is staff forgotten its roots and humble beginning food is not just about food the rating is based on my nd rd visit it consistently disappoint me during my nd and rd visits used to be my favourite roasted meat seemed to be so hard and charred as though it is serving from last nite is leftovers horrendous its chicken wasnt the best in sg too similar tenderness can be found in other chicken rice stalls though they are not awarded the michelin starits noodle is also not the best in sg do read tripadvisor for more truthit should not embark so fast on a pompus expansion plan to bangkok taiwan etc ctrieshawker chan stall should be called chan geng that means in cantonese previously once now no longer a good hawker chan,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,hawker chan is worthy of its michelin star the sampler meat platter was tender succulent and cooked to perfection,Negative
liao-fan-hawker-chan,cheapest one star michelin stall  now with indoor spot cannot bring in drinks i like both the char siu and soya chicken but the pork is amazing if you like the glistening soft centers with dark harder flavorful tips like burnt ends,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,this is an easy place where you can find it on the streets the food is priced at affordable cost not bad to try the taste is ok,Positive
liao-fan-hawker-chan,place is nice line was long even though it was not lunch nor dinner time but was moving fast  self order kiosk  actual kiosk serving the line food was not as excellent as i expected but i kinda get the idea that the sauce might be the cause of the buzz,Negative
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,absolutely insane cocktails kind of expensive th stunning views but great ambiance music is popping later best at sundowners menu is not super loaded  great for short lunch rendezvous,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,we went here for drinks and they have super sweet cocktails we ordered  and could not finish half of any of them on the other hand the drinks are huge other then that we had a great view of the gardens from our table,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,one of the best views of the city without a doubt was here for a company happy hour event they have a minimum spend for large groups but the host was gracious enough to accomodate us even otherwise drinks are nice and strong and they have some excellent canaps as well service is great as well its right next to the infamous infinity pool though that is for guests only it is expensive though given the location and the view the cost is worth it,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,wonderful lunch spot with the incredible th floor views of singapore and the bay our reservation timed perfectly with a thunderstorm so we got to watch the clouds roll in we enjoyed the grilled organic chicken club brioche apple wood smoked bacon avocado sunny side up egg comt cheese herb aioli super soft bread and tons of veggies and the bincho grilled salmon salad hijiki seaweed rice korean banchan gochujang sesame chilithe salmon fell apart as soon as my fork touched it perfectly buttery and light the array of types of salads beneath the salmon was really neat to experiment with i paired with the wolfgang puck chardonnay and could not have been happier,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,to be honest we came here to eat just because of the view and being californians it seemed very appropriate naturally this restaurant will be everything you expected to be incredible service incredible food and a view that rivals every other view,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,view is amazing this bar is next to the infamous infinity pool so if you cannot afford a night in the hotel and still was to see the pool this is going to be your best option i absolutely loved the view menu prices are decent for being what it is and where it is for singapore the prices are pretty average i recommend coming to this spot highly if you are unable to stay a night at this hotel,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,had an amazing lunch at spago beautiful views of the gardens by the bay from the top of marina bay sands excellent food and service a remarkable price  sgd per person for three courses the portions are also very generous it is amazing to go to such a high end restaurant and not leave hungry unequivocally recommend this place appetizers pt de campagne delicious and a large portionbig eye tuna tartare cones two small delicious one bite conesmains grilled chicken cobb salad perfect execution on this classicsteamed japanese sea bream large portion good flavor beautiful presentationdessert pistachio panna cotta one of the best desserts i have had all year,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,the view is great from up here this is a better alternative to queuing up for the sky park,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,being at the top of the boat at the top of the sands in the hottest spot in singapore is enough reason to go the bartender is amazing the scene would make anyone envious and watching people swim in the infinity pool at the top of the world is about as perfect a view as there is but then the food a very expensive burger as you would expect with the ideal brioche bun and seasonings reflective of the region and fries crispy on the outside soft in the middle the only thing keeping it from five stars was that i was emphatic about a medium rare burger they acted as though i was crazy for ordering it and then served it well done bot a glimmer of pink oh well totally worth it anyway,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,second night in a row here the drinks are fantastic the view of the skyline is beautiful and the halo halo dessert is heavenly i had halo halo several times in the philippines but i actually preferred this version over what i have had in the home that originated the unique cultural dessert definitely suggest trying it,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,fantastic meal high up on top of marina bay sands sat by the window which was nice for seeing the tree light show below fyi shows are at   and   pm had both an appetizer white asparagus and main dish lamb there is a good wine list to complement the food a selection of breads with both salted and unsalted butter was delicious we did not order desert but they provided a very nice anniversary plate to celebrate our special occasion,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,a big thank you to the staff spagosingapore we wanted to end our last night in singapore with a special dinner so spago was a great choice spago is located on the top floor of marina bay sands and the view is breathtaking the staff made us feel so special the love and hospitality was amazing we will be back soon thank you to the managers who came out to talk to us and even brought our main course out starter   big eye tuna tartare cones complimentary from the chef   pumpkin brown butter dumplings main   honey miso broiled black cod   dutch milk fed veal chop desert   calamansi vanilla vacherin,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,amazing food was superb every small plate was absolutely delicious and perfect the staff were very attentive without being in your way tables are spaced a reasonable distance apart cocktails were tasty but the views from the th floor open air with infinity pool in front of you degree views that are dazzling the garden by the bay the city skyline the cargo ships lined up like an old painting in a museum words do not do it justice it was expensive but oh so worth it,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,best place to chill in evenings and try some food and cocktails together there are hidden cocktails which you can order only if you have been there i would not revel the secret as it is really amazing to order those exclusive cocktails not in the menu the staff is very friendly and best time to go is between  pm when there is easy availability of seats to relax and enjoy the evening price is on higher side for every dish compared to normalplaces due to its location and view of the entire city,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,happy hour    beers  to choose  drinks  to choose   wines  to choose l appetizers grilled cheese yum fried chicken bites yum spring roll yum salmon no idea glynn the manager is welcoming and is interested in those spending time effort and money to be here it is truly refreshing to see a manager staff restaurant get that the simplest welcoming and earnest hello from staff brings out wallets and creates instant customer retention the whole staff and experience is welcoming this is a busy very high end restaurant it is not cheap those coming here expect to be delivered the best service and expect to pay for the service and ambiance too this place does not disappoint makes me really happy and it is my number one recommendation in singapore level  is my second,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,you think spago is beyond over and it is this dusty relic from the past but i was so happy with my experience unbeatable location with views of the crazy mbs pool and the surrounding city lovely ambiance and very spacious inside too excellent service attentive and friendly drinks in singapore are so pricey especially at and around mbs and given those circumstances they have one of the best happy hours the drinks are delicious and so is the food i could come here everyday for a drink some spring rolls and chicken karaage and be happy seriously though i am a seasoned international drinker and the cocktails here and the other wolfgang puck restaurant cut are some of the best i have ever had,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,perched atop the famous marina bay sands is spago a wolfgang puck restaurant that has locations around the world my personal favorite is the beverly hills location but the singapore location has the best views by far i went for lunch and made a pm reservation in hopes of dodging the suits that were sure to fill the dining area later in the afternoon getting to the top of mbs is always an adventure and i got lost as i took the wrong elevator in tower  which only took me to the nd floor but eventually made it to the top after three elevator transfers the proposed route involves two elevator transfers so keep an eye out for the lifts that take you up to the th floor in tower  and then take a second lift up to the th floor upon arriving you will see the spago bar and lounge to your right and the fine dining area to your left straight ahead you will see glimpses of the mouth dropping view through the welcome area the fine dining area has a dress code of business casual and i saw many people turned away for wearing flip flops or swim gear the restaurant shares a roof with an infinity pool so i put on a decent dress with slip on sneakers it seemed to work just fine and i was seated promptly by the window which overlooks the water where you can watch the ships hang out just past the gardens by the bay the staff were so nice and did not seem to mind me a lone blogger taking a table all to myself the interior of the dining room is gorgeous with white table cloths and a beautiful orchid center piece it honestly seemed a lot classier than the beverly hills spago and way classier than the las vegas spago which i think shut down good riddance i was presented with a very luxe a la carte menu for lunch but opted to go with the express prix fixe  courses for  the express lunch is quite the deal as i recently paid  just for one singapore sling i also got my favorite cocktail peace on earth for an extra  i originally ordered the tuna cones but they already had one made for me so i swapped out my first course for the chicken laksa spring roll per the recommendation of the staff this appetizer is unique to the singapore spago and i am really glad i made the swap i was not sure i wanted anything fried but the spring rolls were cooked to perfection and filled with a warm asian flavors with a thicker curry texture there is a delicious coconut flavor that lingered with each bite i did not see coconut listed as part of the dish so perhaps i imagined it whatever it was it was great i enjoyed the tuna cone but it paled in comparison to the spring rolls next i got the steamed red snapper it looked absolutely stunning the fish was cooked well and the garnish tasted of a light soy sauce and was enjoyable on its own it is served with a side of rice which was tasty i tested the sauce that was on the side but i was not a fan so i skipped it i will say that the flavors of the dish while delicious were clearly on or around the fish if you are looking for a fish with deep flavors infused into every bite you wont get it with this snapper however if you are like me and you appreciate the natural taste of fish it is pretty good finally it was time for dessert each express lunch comes with a pistachio panna cotta on a hot day this dessert is truly refreshing with orange flavors all over the panna cotta there is a lot going on on top of the actual dessert candied this and that but the orange gelato was fantastic and the panna cotta itself ignoring the pistachio brittle and other toppings was divine the quality of food decor and service at spago never disappoints except in vegas and i would highly recommend going to spago for a business lunch or a special occasion if you only plan to go to singapore once definitely go to spago for either dinner or just head to the lounge if you come to singapore often it is not a must unless you are in the mood for stunning views paired with delicious views i will probably be back at some point total cost  th floor of marina bay sands tower singaporethis is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,i have taken quite a few visiting friends to ce la vi however i never really liked it service is very average and f b offerings are generally disappointing but obviously you are there for the amazing view why no one ever told me before that there is a much better alternative is a puzzle to me spago bar lounge is simply awesome the view is in my opinion even better than clv you can see the whole of marina bay plus you get to see the well known mbs infinity pool the service is on point from the person picking up the phone over the hostess to the waiters all were really helpful and pro active the food is amazing who would have thought that a tourist trap such as the mbs rooftop serves on of the best burgers in singapore and the tuna tartare cones are to die for the drinks are really great i am known to be quite picky on my cocktails both the hot legs and grin n bare it were fantastic the only downside is that they do not serve ranch dressing to go with their otherwise delicious burger and fries i honestly cannot wait to try the other snacks of the bar menu and their full restaurant menu so i can tell you you wo not see me again at ce la vi anytime soon unless calvin harris preferably doused in ranch comes and invites me personally,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,the top of this sands is an unbelievable setting and an amazing view there is no question about that the restaurant is lovely and has gone out of its way to make sure that most all tables have amazing views that is reason enough to come have a meal here i recommend coming during the day as the view of downtown singapore is great during the day and there is some amusing people watching at the rooftop pool right next to the restaurant that being said the restaurant is quite good and manages to avoid the typical pitfall of the scenic view restaurant nice house too bad no one is home the food was excellent and definitely approachable for the tourist crowd without being boring no small accomplishment dumplings kblt and soft omelet were all delicious kblt was really really good only two issues with the place the tuna tartare cones were off and we sent them back they did come right off the bill so all good there the second is the typical for singapore disinterested level of service we had several long awkward service gaps which required us to flag down our often absent waiter we had to ask for more water etc it was a non stop cavalcade of flagging down wait staff to handle things which should have been handled while annoying this is what i have come to expect in singapore so i only get mildly annoyed now that my expectations have been beaten into shape,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,the view is beautiful as hell the food and drinks are extraordinary the price is not too expensive for the test beauty and enjoyment you get,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,i came twice lunch dinner were both delicious our waiter was very attentive and recommended things from the menu there cocktails are even more amazing had a nice view and place was beautiful,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,well the conference was finally over and i had some time to relax after spending some time in the pool it was time to try spago i sat at the bar area and had a spicy tuna and grilled octopus appetizer they were both quite tasty the service was great as well the price is well as you would expect it pricey for the phenomenal location i would go back if i find myself in singapore again,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,i will be honest i did not have high expectations for this place i thought that they were going to be snobby like their rooftop counterpart at ce la vie i thought the food was going to be subpar and overpriced to my surprise i was wrong our waitress was fantastic and super friendly the staff here clearly know the food on the menu well and seemed to have tried all the dishes so they were able to make great recommendations here are a few reasons to come amazing view it is right by the pool instead of paying to go to the pool to enjoy the view why not com here instead the prie fixe lunch menu wo not break the bank it is  the food is creative and good let is start with the atmosphere the windows were huge and bright allowing you to enjoy the sunshine and take in the view of the beautiful singapore skyline there is a huge vase with hanging orchids in the middle of the room the open kitchen is great you can watch the chefs prepare your food also the bathrooms are great there are individual private stalls let is talk about the food appetizers chicken laksa spring roll this was my favorite appetizer the flavor was unique i have never had such a delicious spring roll before and would highly recommend it pan seared pork dumplings this was good too but you can easily get pork dumplings anywhere big eye tuna tartare cones i felt as if i was eating a tiny ice cream cone filled with tuna tartare the presentation was beautiful you definitely should order this main course grilled iberico pork the pork was cooked to perfection it was so tender and juicy desert pistachio panna cotta amazing after eating your meal you can take some great pics by the pool do not worry there are no rude staff from ce la vie to tell you that you cannot take pictures unless you get bottle service you are free to stand there as long as you like to take photos,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,i love the place they view is spectacular we were greeted by john tj and he assisted us on what to order he is so impressive because he knows everything in the menu he is the best look for him when you go to this place we only ordered drinks and each one of them is bomb bomb bomb will definitely come back,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,as a part of our stay at marina bay sands we were looking forward to the dining options offered at such a luxurious place during the time of our stay we were told that they were in midst of constructing a new dining area and there were a few choices to choose from one of which was spago spago is located on the th floor which is where the infinity pool is located we were seated immediately upon arrival and introduced to the breakfast buffet offerings the space inside was kind of cramped with the amount of guests and servers walking back and forth the breakfast area was quite limited and selection smaller than what i expected there was cheese and charcuterie fruits yogurt cereal oatmeal smoked salmon greens muffins and croissants juice milk coffee and tea were also available our server came by to take our orders for the hot menu items once we were done with the self serve items we ordered an omelet and smoked salmon eggs benedict when the eggs came out we were surprised to find a small omelet and a very small eggs benedict dish when i order benedicts i expect an order to have two however spago only gives one kind of strange in my opinion a few minutes after receiving those hot items we got the bill slapped onto our table i understand that they are busy and are trying their best to get hotel guests in and out of the dining area but come on the smoked salmon eggs benedict was delicious albeit shameful for such a fancy place but had a superb buttery flavor the omelet was your typical omelet with whatever meats and veggies you wanted to add i am not sure if marina bay sands will continue to utilize the same restaurant to serve breakfast to its guests after its new constructions but we thought that this was the least appealing part of our stay i cannot speak for dinner service here but the pro i got from my experience was the view from the skyscraper,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,definitely mediocre pre cooked underseasoned lobster in the s  lobster cobb nice view does not quite make up for it,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,let is just say that the setting is amazing perched high on the mount the top of the marina bay sands hotel you are somewhat secluded and separated from the rest of the masses that seek out the infinity pool below you which is comforting and the interior certainly has an air or sophistication about it that keeps it classy my dinner was excellent though the portions were on the lean side for the price that being said i would eat there tomorrow any time but the ambience was rather sterile may be it was a just a quiet boring crowd us included the price of the wine was laughable i would rather leave with a better taste in my mouth than a bitter feeling of being robbed it kind of tarnished the whole experience for me mind you that is kind of the vibe i get from being at the marina bay sands anyway a kind of give us your money and go feeling,Negative
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,just left the buffet as a guest of marina bay sands as an upgrade to my stay i have this restaurant included in my breakfast buffet selection this is definitely a nice breakfast place love the pool and ambience food was good but the service is amazing we had an older chinese lady helping us and she was great spoke chinese to my wife as i tried to give her a nice tip for taking care of us she rejected and said as long as we had a great time she is happy where can u find that in america or asia overall will be back when we stay here again next year,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,herms is the best bartender in singapore espresso martinis old fashion you name it have not had a better experience worth going just for him to make you a drink,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,beautiful venue and the cocktails are reasonably priced especially if your order come on get luckyfantastic views as you would expect from the top of marina bay sands,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,the restaurant was located at level  of marina bay sands one had to take the lift at tower  to level  before changing another lift to level  the restaurant overlooked the swimming with a nice view of the city i was showed to a table indoor by the window but the view was blocked by the green i was having the  course restaurant week lunch  i was served an assorted of bread rolls consisted of mini sized french baguette and rustic italian ciabatta bread roll stuffed with dried fruits served with salted and unsalted butter on a marble slab both rolls were crusty and soft inside i personally preferred the ciabatta roll with the salted butter which enhanced the sweetness of the dried fruit is taste big eye tuna tartare cones ala carte  pieces chili aioli soy wasabi shaved bonito scallions masagothe raw tuna was refreshing combined with the crunchy and slighty spicy cone however i felt the wasabi taste came across a tab too strong soft french omelet ala carte  field mushrooms gruyere cheese roasted fingerling potatoes arugula saladcut opened the inside of the omelet was filled with melted cheese and soften shiitake mushroom slices the baby potato is taste was greatly enhanced by the shaved cheese on top coconut passion fruit triflecoconut mousse almond nutmeg meringue passion fruit creamit looked simple but the taste and texture was a combination of crispy crunchy rice crisp sour raspberries rich creamy coconut mousse and creamy almond cream finished the meal with a pot of white tea  which was light and refreshing it was served with some biscuits overall the food was great service was great too with the staffs checking on the food from time to time the only con was the noisy table of indonesians sitting next to me making a headache growing inside me,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,i would heard negative things about the food at spago so we opted to come up to the bar for a drink and skip the food entirely great decision since the drinks were awesome and we were happy incredible views from the top of mbs without a cover charge and plenty of lounge seating available spago has more of a chill atmosphere when compared to the other bar club options at mbs which was perfect for us,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,i was pleasantly surprised by our experience at spago by wolfgang puck at the marina bay sands after all this was the tourist attraction in singapore located in a hotel and casino complex with numerous restaurants and bars however having just viewed a documentary on netflix on the world is great hotels i gained some incredible insight into the inner workings of this giant city in the sky spago is located on the sky park which you can access via elevator in tower  it will take you up to the  something floor where you will need to transfer to another set of elevators to take you all the way up to the top do not be surprised when you exit the first set of elevators directly into a lounge just turn left and head toward the other set of elevators once on the sky park level you will have two options if you are a guest of the hotel you are keycard will give you access to the pool area however if you are like most of us you can only line up at spago once at the front of the line they should in theory ask you if you are there for dinner or drinks and i assume if you are there for dinner you probably already have a reservation we were there for dessert they will seat you pretty far away from the edge so if you want to take pictures of the singapore skyline or the gardens by the bay do not be afraid to get up and move around the bar menu was small and expensive but the flavors were on point or at least what we had just to illustrate how much expensive the menu is two small orders of a granita type dessert cost more than our four lunch and dinner combined however price aside you are there really for the ambiance and they do have that in abundance it is a cross between la hipster and vegas glam it is not for everyone but it is worth a visit just as the marina bay sands is worth a visit while in singapore,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,completely speechless what can i say other than beyond amazing food service and views do not miss going to this place if you are in singapore i had the lobster risotto goat cheese and beet salad and a dessert which i cannot remember the name all of it amazing,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,great spot for the view some drinks and good food a great combination makes this place a must visit for the singapore experience there are  views of the harbor city etc and the time of the day is not relevant as there is always something of beauty to see whether it is the sunset or the lit city and surrounding areas food consisted mostly of appetizers which included well executed sushi rolls and a few other items great experience overall,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,the food was alright nothing to really rave about given that it is a fusion and they do not particularly specialize in anything although i have to say that the decor and ambience is romantic would be amazing to take a love one out and enjoy the view,Negative
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,phenomenal meal definitely my favorite restaurant i have eaten at in nearly  years in singapore the food is amazing we had the beet salad honey glazed black cod tuna tartare and the caramel souffle all of which were delicious and unique the honey glaze on the black cod was sooooo gooooood on top of that the service was the best michael and his team were so attentive and explained every little detail of the menu they took the time to visit but service was very efficient and professional they also know their food and understand both gluten free and vegetarian concerns very well oh and view at night is beautiful it all made for a perfect evening,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,it is funny because i live  minutes away from santa monica and spago was the first meal i had in singapore their seafood is imported from the farmers markets of santa monica so that was kind of funny the food was beyond incredible the kaya toast was the die for but my boyfriend loved loved loved the veal tartare i also loved loved loved the oyster gratin the small appetizer bites were packed with flavor and freshness it was one amazing bite after another for entrees my friend got the veal chop which was amazing and you should totally get that the crispy skin sea bass was also delicious for dessert i was in love with and still dream about the chocolate semifredo omg do it get it everything i ate was mind blowing we basically ate every appetizer and every dessert everything was amazing and you basically cannot go wrong with anything you order here yum yum i would go back if i was in singapore again the view was amazing from the top floor we even got to see fireworks because formula  was in town and wrapping up,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,great view at the top of the marina bay sands hotel i had my favorite spicy ahi poke cones and they did not disappoint very good quality although quite pricey  for california roll hence the  star review it is though a wolfgang puck restaurant so it is expected to be expensive but it was overall very good,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,we were fortunate enough that we were able to snag an early reservation here as it seems to book up quite quickly eating from the th floor is amazing and really shows off how singapore is a major port as you look out the windows and see a city of boats anchored offshore the atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasant as its very sophisticated yet relaxed that you are not afraid if you following etiquette to a t the prices here are higher as you would expect as you are eating in the hotel casino establishment just like you would expect in las vegas the food was phenomenal the singapore touch of spices and seasoning was delectable on the classic snapper laksa our desserts and appetizers were also very tasty we did fall for the sparkling or flat water technique but they do have tap water if you ask for it overall if you do not want to venture out of the hotel and only want to take the elevator ride up i would definitely recommend this place,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,myself and my colleagues were in singapore to celebrate a wonderful achievement one that brought over  of us into the city we specifically went to spago to enjoy the singapore skyline and wonderful cocktails everything to be fully paid for without issue similar to any other business trip about an hour into our evening a man whom i can only assume was the manager approached me to begin questioning our stay he highlighted that some of our colleagues had already left without paying something that is quite normal given we expense everything to the same firm when i told him not to worry that we plan to pay the bill in full he began to pressure me further and express concern that they could not split the bill  ways he was presuming each of us would pay separately when i explained to him again that would not be an issue he refused to accept nor believe my statement instead of staying and enjoying the evening this experience made us feel unwelcome so we cashed out and left it was one of my most frustrating experiences in quite some time and dealt with by spago in a rather insulting manner if they were concerned we would have gladly put a card down to secure a tab where they could have made more money spago chose to lose a number of customers who not only were willing to pay but were willing to pay as much as necessary to enjoy our evening all because of a waitress could not ask the appropriate questions and an inexperienced manager who handled the situation quite poorly in my almost two decades of traveling on business this was my first experience where an establishment did not understand business travelers and expense accounts not a very good experience for your brand wolfgang,Negative
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,this restaurant is opened by wolfgang puck a name that is very familiar when it comes to fine dining it is his second restaurant in singapore after cut which is another grandiose masterpiece his first spago restaurant in beverly hills was awarded with  michelin stars the menu here is said to be mainly focused on californian cuisine that includes seasonal dishes prepared and cooked in an avant garde manner however i personally think that most of the food here is quite creative extremely delicious and impeccably influenced by asian cuisine for example hokkaido scallop sashimi  honey miso broiled japanese black cod  steamed salmon hongkong style  kaya toast with seared foie gras and pandan coconut jam  if you fancy a more casual atmosphere there is a terrace lounge side offering another delicious asian influenced bites like pork pot sticker dumplings  grilled korean pork belly  and chinese bao glazed short ribs  overall i am impressed and it totally exceeded my expectation i will be back note the lounge overlooks mbs famous infinity pool with a spectacular view of the city skyline which is totally a plus i love this romantic place indeed,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,amazing food amazing ambiance beautiful views its cloud  i loved the tuna cones spring rolls yummy bread sticks pasta was delicious everything we ordered was amazing i would love to come again,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,this review is only for the lounge bar area food is amazing while the menu is small the quality is topthe views are amazing there is fresh area plants and just a wonderful atmosphere staff is friendly and professionali can only recommend going there,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,i first went to spago in beverly hills over  years ago and back then it was the place to be and quite a scene flash forward to  and it is interesting to walk into spago again but in singapore and atop mbs at that given the extreme difference in the setting and city though spago has done a great job of bringing the socal concept to singapore starting from the interior i love the clean modern rustic space and of course the views something the la location does not have the menu is all spago as well which means fusion cooking lunch is a great deal here as well at  for  courses some of my favorite dishes here are the tuna tartare cones so delicious the bincho grilled salmon served with korean banchan which reminded me of a play on bibimbap and also a very satisfying burger service is solid but again i wish we had better options for american wines definitely one of my favorite places at the moment,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,caveat i have not yet eaten here but will update my review after dinner tonight as a paying guest of the marina bay sands hotel i walked up from the infinity pool to make my reservation for dinner prior to making the reservation i was asked if i wanted to see the menu first apparently the hostess wanted me to see the prices before hand i can only assume because she did not ask anyone else in line the same question it is because i am an african american woman we too have money to spend obviously spago staff needs sensitivity training,Negative
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,really amazing place be sure to come earlier in the evening and grab a drink at the outdoor poolside bar infinity pool before to take in the stunning views of singapore amazing service amazing food amazing ambience and more importantly amazing sommelier we spent about   for three persons because of the wine mainly and that is because the sommelier called up his buddies at various other places to get us exactly the wines vintages we wanted great service magical evening,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,love it here spago opened up very recently atop marina bay sands overlooking the badass infinity pool this is wolfgang puck is marquee restaurant brand and i am beyond excited they opened it at this location in singapore i have been to the ones in la my mother is favorite las vegas and hawaii in the past and always very much enjoyed their great service and impeccable food in addition to those three they also have restaurants in colorado and istanbul which all have unique ingredients that make each spago restaurant very different from each other spago singapore is also innovative in its own way and you will see this immediately when receiving the menu to find kaya toast pan seared alaska halibut laksa and steamed salmon hong kong style on their menu i have been to this restaurant once and their lounge on numerous occasions for date nights and friends gatherings and this place really cannot be beat for a late night open air lounge feel after a few drinks i had a momentary setback to thinking i was in la or miami but let is start with restaurant side you walk into a door that reminded me of the french laundry in napa and feel completely away from the mbs setting total class all around from the moment you sit down and are offered water the food and service are outstanding spago calls itself a californian cuisine restaurant which i have always felt means the kind of food you would eat while kicking back and drinking wine and we actually had a waiter from california serve our table which was pretty cool my girlfriend and i ordered the following  big eye tuna tartare cones this is spago is staple starter across all of his restaurants every part of it is fresh even the cones are handmade in the spago kitchen so good  hand cut agnolotti with white truffle so good we got two orders of it fresh agnolotti pasta with a generous portion of white truffle so good  i ordered the grilled sonoma lamb chops these were incredible and perfect for the insignia wine that we ordered  my girlfriend ordered the honey miso broiled japanese black cod which she loved as well we unfortunately were too full for dessert but will opt for it next time around i would highly recommend doing a dinner here for whatever occasion solid food that you can expect great quality from for the lounge i have been here many times now and love every bit of it this is the first lounge in singapore that i feel operates the way a lounge should great wine and drinks great bar snacks food great music great service in a very comfortable and airy environment it is run very efficiently and they hire good people to take great care of you come here for even one beer and you will see that you can just let your hair down and enjoy yourself something i find a rarity in with singapore drinking culture it truly feels like they brought in an la or miami type classy casual spot into singapore and totally nailed it they have the big eye tuna tartare cones here so make sure to get those while sipping one of their delicious cocktails the sliders and langoustine are very good the california roll uses real crab and is very delicious despite a more expensive price tag and for the sweet tooths out there they serve a really good halo halo dessert they are open late after midnight too totally check this place out very highly recommend for a solid date night cocktail or a casual hangout with friends,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,reminds me of my home back in la went here for drinks and it was amazing great view great weather great service great drinks and finger food and dessert had the tuna tataki cones fried chicken grilled cheese sandwich and my girlfriends had the mochi waffles which were supposed to be really good i had the first cocktail on the menu super light and refreshing service was really top notch every time i used a napkin and put it on the table it vanished whenever water was half empty it was filled up right away this is the kind of service that i think singapore needs anyway trying their dinner tonight for my brother in law is birthday will keep you updated but highly recommend for drinks and finger food and probably do dinner for big celebrations,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,stunning view over singapore the food was also very good you need to reserve a table in advance since the place is very crowded,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,this review is for the bar and bistro area only usherettes that welcome you to the bar are only concerned about getting you in any special requests such as getting bar seats will not be entertained rude and stuck up she basically hijacked us as soon as the the th floor elevator door opened not happy with the service from this stand point cocktails were made soooo slow and we waited for  mins granted it was busy and the male server apologised it was interesting to see that the people in work suits were given their beers and other drink orders before us when we were seated way before these people not happy never coming back here again it is a shame because compared to the fine dining area this is area has dropped the ball on a thursday night,Negative
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,this review is for the bar not for the restaurant my friends and i went here on our last night to have some celebratory dinner and drinks to the end of an amazing vacation greeted by the hostesses at the front we were not asked if we were there for dinner or just drinks and were quickly ushered to a table in the bar area without knowing it was only an appetizer menu we ordered a few things i had the potstickers which were absolutely delicious the flavor was perfect and the sauce very good as well when delivered to our table we were shocked at the size as we were still thinking it was dinner our waitress nadezda did nothing to make this a great experience she did not offer to explain the drink or food menu only came back to the table to collect the dirty plates and bring us the bill for a restaurant that is owned by someone as prestigious as wolfgang puck i would expect both the food and service to be top notch our waitress nadezda was one of the most rude stuck up and overall worst waitresses i have ever had her overall bad attitude and terrible service greatly impeded us from having a wonderful time if you go here just keep this in mind,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,i cannot think of a better word this fantastic food wine and service was awesome will definitely go again,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,this is a rating for the bar not restaurant amazing views of the singapore naturally on east side lots of pool goers walking past on the west side good place to people watch all day and night because the pool is packed right up until people are forced out at around pm reason for the lower rating is due to the cocktail staff super friendly and accommodating but a little pushy on their agenda for drinks seemed like they were needing to use up their gin many cocktail waitresses came from russia kinda random i know,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,by far the best burger i have ever had one cannot really imagine anyone messing up a burger but they got it so right and then we got the ice cream sandwich for dessert and i was amazed how good that was also,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,you pay for the views i had lunch here by myself at the bar service was attentive since it was not really crowded at night a different story the lobster cobb salad is actually filling nice size portion again great for the views and a big bank account,Positive
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,if i were only rating the food and service it would be  stars if you are going for the view do not bother the restaurant is surrounded by the pool we did not enjoy seeing bathers as we dined at such a nice restaurant it took a lot away from the experience we were looking forward to seeing the light show below after dinner only to be told we could not have access to the rest of the area outside of the restaurant not cool after a  meal lastly we had a hard time figuring out how to get there  different elevators that were not labeled well and we were not guests of the hotel so not sure we would have had access to even get there if not for a friendly employee in the elevator that swiped his key card for us great food but the atmosphere is totally over rated also the reason i chose this place was because of the menu and when we arrived we found that the menu had been changed and not updated online,Negative
spago-by-wolfgang-puck,omg the best meal i have had in my life thus far my husband and i booked this restaurant a month in advance the food was knock your socks off good every bite was an explosion of flavors in your mouth the staff was very tentative and we had a wonderful experience thank you for making our time there special,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,a sophisticated speakeasy style bar while unmarked from the outside if you are here during opening hours make your way right in and you will be greeted by a friendly hostess and also by friendly staff there is a ginormous menu of cocktails arranged broadly by flavor profiles fresh bold tropical among others all drinks are priced at s  us   but are worth it given the quality and detail that go into each one the diplomatic immunity diplomatico planas rum lime ginger aperol hopped grapefruit jamaican funk and button masher plantation original dark rum peanut butter px sherry raspberry single malt were both solid better yet there is quite a solid food menu here i went with something on the smaller side the yummy truffled mac n cheese balls but there are larger offerings like the burger cubano and chicken tenders to help you soak up all that booze service is courteous and professional here not least from a friendly manager originally from nyc whom i chatted with and the venue itself is worth the visit modern sexy and gorgeous a great find thanks to all you yelpers out there,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,was desperately looking for signs of life around town during chinese new year so glad this place was open and was able to spend a nice relaxing evening here going through  rounds of joy lucas was a solid performer the whole night out the favorite of the night was definitely the green park coming from the american bar in london i honestly could actually just drink that one thing all night next time the hint of basil and celery made the the drink so refreshing and light also got some truffle mac croquettes to munch on that were pretty good ambiance at this place was pretty good nothing too loud or rowdy was able to have a nice conversation with some of the other people i met there special shout out to fellow yelper joelle for putting up with me most of the night and for the tips on some of the other bars in the area,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,fabulous cocktails almost speak easy like gets packed real quick and limited seating more on the dark and intimate side,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,recently when i was still in hk my texas mates were partying hard in sg and obviously soused when they finally hit yet another bar which they described as bespoke and somewhere along hong kong street the next thing they knew was me back in sg and us filled with seafood goodness from jb ah meng and sipping whisky at the single cask one of them lost his wallet the night before and was obviously pretty depressed as all his usd and cards were in there so we tried to rewind his memory to narrow down where he could have misplaced it after much detective work we decided that it could have been that very bespoke bar along hong kong street which they thought was number  i immediately corrected them and told them the bar they were at that fateful night before has to be none other than  hong kong street a hail mary phone call was made by him to  hong kong street and lo and behold they have his wallet we quickly bottoms up our whisky and rushed over when we got here they were all ready to return his wallet much to the elation of my buddy and he quickly gave them a big tip we then proceeded to grab more whisky at the bar before settling down when seats became available the nikka never tasted so good to my friend and he obviously got the tab for it thank you all his money and cards were intact and he just could not believe it only in sg he proclaimed the staff here also proceeded to serve us a free round of shots how awesome is that only in  hong kong street we proclaimed so if you ever feel like losing your wallet,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,unexpected visit to this place as it was not on my agenda nor radar i wanted to visit other bars that have emerged since i last visited singapore i made an impromptu stop and ended up staying here for a few hours i even ended up running into a bartender from my absolute favorite bar here in singapore at this place drinks remained pretty amazing bartenders extremely accommodating all i can say is oh what a night,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,chanced by this place after dinner at clarke quay we were there fairly early about h and it was already quite crowded drinks were good and tasty but the thing i loved most was that they were willing to customize drinks based on what we liked my husband wanted an umami drink and they delivered service staff were nice and attentive cool place to unwind after a long day at work will definitely be back for their mac and cheese balls,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,how do you get the kids to eat brussel sprouts just add bacon this is one of hk  is tasty morsels and along with the mac n cheese balls which are a superb twist on an arancini ball they have got some of the best bar snacks going hk  is the quintessential hidden bar unassuming doorway in the middle of unassuming street and like many cocktail bars from the street is namesake city there are heavy japanese influences in the meticulous mixing attention to detail staff and delicious drinks there is a huge number of spirits on display and the staff are energetic and ready to deliver an experience that you will remember no matter how many drinks you have beware they make them boozy here so if you are a lightweight you could be stumbling after   drinks prices are also at the high end however you are in one of the top  bars in asia so that is understandable if you are a seasoned campaigner then i recommend going off menu as where hk really shines is when you challenge the staff to create something new,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,after witnessing some of the craziness of clarke quay the night before my friend decided to take me here as a change of scenery and also so i could experience a place that was awarded the best bar in asia i am glad she did because i love speakeasy is and i also appreciate well made cocktails the entrance to the bar was both kind of cool and a bit obvious that it was a speakeasy luckily the day we went it was not too full so we could actually talk to each other as well as chat up the interesting bartenders here seriously the man making my drinks dropped some life knowledge on me that night most importantly the cocktails are extremely well made and also quite creative i ordered some type of play on an old fashioned and it was probably one of the best i have ever had in my life i am not the biggest fan of french  is but i nearly drank all of my friend is because it was that good too we also had their version of a manhattan and some gin berry drink but those drinks could not compare to our first two everything was going great until the bar started to turn up the music way too loud i am fine with creating a fun atmosphere with music but this was pretty excessive we were going to order one more round of drinks but decided to head somewhere else because we could not hear anything other than the music hks you were so close to perfection,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,came here in oct  while visiting singapore their truffle mac cheese balls were delicious each of the cocktails we tried were great as well only complaint was that the lighting was very dark might not have minded as much if it were just a bar or if we were just drinking but would have preferred a bit more light as we were eating i would definitely go back,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,greeted at the door by a circus freak looking woman with rods sticking out of her face and tattooed head to toe the bar was wall to wall guys very slow service i left after  minutesdo not waste your time here,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,for asia is  best bars  for a reasonservice was unreal had such a great time i will be back,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,excellent speakeasy bar it is really not that hard to find the place gets pretty packed on the weekend but it is worth checking out the drinks are new york city priced but they are pretty great the bartenders are friendly and it is worth sitting at the counter just to chat them up the food is nothing to write home about,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,i am not huge into writing reviews in general but i had to say something about hks i came with my girlfriend and some of her friends here one night we were excited to check out all the hype over  hong kong st seeing that it is  for asia is  best bars for  we come from nyc and are pretty use to checking out speakeasies we came away from this one disappointed it is highly overrated they need to approach more seriously their service quality control service here is lackluster we came in around  pm on a weekday expecting it to be likely popping eventually but in a speakeasy sense it started off alright the vibe in here was what exactly we were looking for cool interior understated entrance etc but soon during our visit servers became inattentive and kept forgetting simple requests from us like providing cutlery for the food we had ordered or refilling our water at several points we wanted to order and try out some more drinks we eventually gave up it took way too long to get a server is attention and then wait on the drinks food to be served it seemed as if half the time they almost were avoiding our attempts to get their attention drinks were creatively named and were interesting concoctions but it would have been nice if the servers were helpful in recommending suggesting instead of straight up impatiently waiting on us to choose and order our drinks an hour or so in during our visit they also upped the music volume and turned up the bass i am not a stickler for music volume i am a fan of lounge music but the bass was uncomfortably strong for a speakeasy there were also large standing crowds around the bar it got clubby in this so called speakeasy bar it devalued the whole experience the music and bass standing people situation made it difficult to enjoy the drinks we ordered and speak among ourselves had a below average experience i do not mind spending more on good service atmosphere and drinks but  hong kong street did not deliver great service or the appropriate atmosphere and because of this this made the drinks we had taste below average for the price we paid and given  hks reputation,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,craft cocktails done well with local flairhighlights big cocktail menu local julep with some tropical flavors long bar and tables along the side classy dark atmospherelowlights close kitchen early no late night snacks and eats unmarked door so have to know where you are goingcool spot that was a bit sf but a nice break from the touristy rowdy circle quay,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,nothing adds more allure to a place than making it exclusive like most speakeasies this bar is discrete and only has a small plaque by the door for identification want in on a weekend you best have a reservation luckily we did we enjoyed a few creatively named cocktails and some appetizers while taking in the atmosphere of a s bar including a few bartenders dressed according to the time period the crimson and clover gin cocktail was excellent and the others ordered looked great as well nothing makes a girl living the paleo lifestyle happier than veggie chips and brussels sprouts with bacon accompanied by good conversation i could have spent hours here heads up on the bathroom sinks they are run by pedals on the floor i looked like a fool waving my hands around under two different faucets before having an employee giggle at me and advise definitely worth the visit,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,hong kong street was awesome there is a cool hidden entry so you just need to know where it is since it looks like nothing is really there when we got there is was standing room only since we were only staying for a drink we did not mind and we got lucky right after we order our drinks a few seat at the bar opened up it is very small and dark inside but loved the dcor the bartenders were awesome we chatted with yoma for a little and he did a great job on our drinks drinks in singapore are defiantly pricey but at least here at  hong kong street you are getting a good drink and not something overpriced and watery if you are looking for a good cocktail this is the place to hit up,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,fun bar good drinks and music a bit trendy and kind of packed a bit annoyed that they have not had the wheels of steel for two weeks and an about to stop going back to find out if they have it or not,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,i love hks for a lot of reasons and have little to add that has not been covered in the other reviews this place is no longer a secret you just tell the taxi driver hong kong street and he already knows exactly where to stop they have recently remodeled the interior cozier curved banquet seats in place of the long straight one more communal round tables in place of the rectangular ones and upholstered poofs in place of the chairs the lighting is now even more dim each of the round tables has a downlight that lights just the table the bar and bar back with an impressive display of spirits is now larger a big thumbs up for all of these very thoughtful and effective improvements the signature drinks are each very delicious in their own distinct and unique way even with the help of the staff sometimes it is a bit of trial and error finding the perfect one that suits your taste part of the fun is sampling these thoughtfully crafted drinks but do not hesitate to toss the menu aside and order your favorite classic cocktail half way through the evening i switched from drinking the hulk smash a refreshing sweet lemony gin concoction served with an excessive amount of ice to a simple well prepared gin tonic served in a tall glass with cucumber i could not have been happier with it the gourmet bar comfort food is good there are many delicious offerings besides the truffle mac cheese balls but honestly if you do not order those you should just stay at home the good what is not to love maybe the bill at the end is a bit of a downer the food and drinks are not cheap but chances are you will be too happy to care the bad all of the thoughtful improvements have really enhanced the overall guest experience it is a more intimate and communal evening gathered around the small round tables chances are you wo not take much notice of anyone outside of those gathered at your table unfortunately last night we sat in the front corner table and all agreed that the music blaring from the overhead speaker above us made it difficult to hear each other we were having to shout a little they should consider either lowering the volume or repositioning the speakers to eliminate this problem the verdict  hong kong street is a great place to meet friends for drinks make reservations in advance to get a good table arrive hungry and thirsty both the food and drinks are addictive   stars,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,i always love popping into this place after having dinner the drinks are always a surprise and the staff have always been very nice to me whenever i come the bartenders are immensely creative and know their craft no pun intended this place is a keeper in my book,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,thankfully i had done enough research to know how to find this place because there are no windows and no signage aside from the  outside as you walk in you enter a curtained off area with a hostess at the end she then leads you through the curtain into the beautiful bar that is  hong kong street a wonderfully dark lit speakeasy type bar where the music is at a perfect level and the staff is happy to greet you i went by myself on a monday night and it was not too busy so i was able to sit at the bar and chat with the bartender the ambience is fantastic and the drinks were fantastic the only reason for not giving it  stars was that i did not try the food but rest assured i will be back oh yes i will certainly be back edit went back and had the burger absolutely fantastic best burger i have had in singapore i also tried the jimi and joni cocktail if you like no nonsense strong yet easy to drink cocktails i highly recommend the j j it was perfect now i feel comfortable giving a solid  stars,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,the hostess is the rudest person i have come across we walked in with a party of  and i have asked for a table she just asked how many of you and walked off she then stopped a few steps after and looked at us with a very irritated look so all this time she wanted us to follow her and walk to our table does she expect people to be a mind reader i noticed thou how she was giving hugs and very welcoming to a male customer walking in i thought this was the best bar in asia and having a very unwelcoming hostess is definitely a huge let down the drinks are well crafted yes but for the price tag and overall experience i will go somewhere else,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,great bar even for non frequenters they have a mixology concept meaning you giving your complete faith to the creative conjuring of drinks eg you want a smokey woody whiskey or something that tastes like popcorn i only ordered once in their menu and honestly cannot remember what i ordered ambience wise it is great for group hangouts or individual socializing,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,the best part about this bar is the fact that it is got a cool hidden entry apart from that it took forever to be served and their cocktails are weak and made perhaps by amateurs this is sad the the fact it felt so promising and for the price that they are charging to enjoy a lemon flavored water gin fizz it just feels as if you would be best having a night out elsewhere i must also say we were in a group apart from the average beverages service the staff also tried to make us pay for their payment mistakes at the end when they had not charged other people enough very disappointing,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,i told understand why this place has received so many awards this place is awesome and the staff knows it it is fun and the atmosphere is a blast the cocktails are great and the bar food is on point,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,if you are in need of comfort food truffle mac cheese balls if you are on the hungrier side the reuben if you want something refreshing salmon cevich with taro chips seriously yum why am i reviewing food in a cocktail bar because they were all simply too delish not to mention this is a kind of place where you will have the most fun sitting at the bar and having a chat with the bartender or wait staff our bartender kept our vocal cords well lubricated and mixed us a few drinks based on our preference of base gin for me thank you very much what tastes we lean towards fruity bitter etc an enjoyable experience in terms of food and cocktails the ambience did not work for me but i see why it is a hit i will definitely be back,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,one of the pioneers or the pioneer in the singapore cocktail speakeasy scene well loved and supported great menus with creative libations to suit almost every taste somewhat a must go for cocktail enthusiast do not forget to order the oh so good mac n cheese balls,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,this place is so much fun hidden entrance great cocktails and plenty of comfort food i came here with a crew of texans and we went full southern ordering items like chicken and waffles and the fried mac and cheese balls everything was wonderful and we really appreciated the bartender shaking his cocktails with attitude,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,drinks could be better i left my  cocktail half full and i love cocktail the best thing for me here is the mac and cheese balls with truffle oil these r amazeballs the concept of the chicken skins was a fantastic one if it was executed right pounded to a translucent crisp and then fried it would have made a great fatty chip ours seem to be fried with rancid oil like they used the oil again and again and kept it for weeks it was disappointing i would not have expected this cheap tactic from a reputable outlet that charges premium prices so i am glad the rest of the snacks made up for the lack of it my take drink straightforward drinks as they use quality spirits do not go nuts with the cocktails and get the macballs,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,one of the top  bars of the world and i am proud it is in singapore great service and now you can even make your reservation using imessage text it is closer to a traditional nyc cocktail bars than the many fancier bars that has sprung up love how it brought many traditional classic cocktails back to life with a new twist plus they do most of their experiments in their lab behind so it is unlikely that you can find a replica elsewhere even for the same cocktails last thing to note they have great bar bites not just your usual peanuts or popcorn just remember to order the truffle mac n cheese balls delish,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,saw this place was in the top ten on a list of the best cocktail bars in the world so of course had to try went on a thursday night around pm and it was standing room only but a table opened up in only about    stars for the hostess she was on point getting us to a table as soon as it opened up the cocktail menu is interesting and as pricey as you might guess s   for a cocktail they have a lot of variety and include the strength on the menu which i have not seen before we had just one round and found the cocktails were very strong and not quite as balanced as i would have hoped the food was a very nice surprise however we tried the brussels sprouts with bacon and grilled cheese with tomato soup and both were uniquely presented and very tasty i may head back to give it another try but honestly i find the cocktails at fine in robinson walk are far superior,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,this place is amazing it has a speakeasy vibe but without all the rules the whiskey cocktails were amazing of course had to measure with and old fashioned and then went for some of the originals the names escape me at the moment so i will have to amend this review once i find the names but trust me it was good i like that the bar was not so loud and is conducive to conversations the fact that it is a small place kinda invites conversations to occurr servers were knowledgeable about whisky and all the menu items this is always a plus definitely coming back here,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,having been here for cocktails several times i now finally also sampled some of the food and feel that i can give a real review of the place it is one of these half secret places but since it has been around for such a pong time it is not secret nor that trendy anymore not an issue for me perhaps even a plus there is however no clear sign outside but should be easy enough to find anyway the place is rather dark but once your eyes get used to the relative darkness the place has a nice ambiance one thing to note is that the air condition is usually cranked up here so it is cold in here even when it is packed and steaming hot outside so have long sleeves or for the girls who want to wear a short sleeved dress bring a scarf or something the staff are very attentive and service minded so we have always been seated fast and they have ensured to make sure you are never stuck with an empty glass they also serve some food and most of the dishes are best to share the food does not fall into to healthy category but it is good the burger was very juicy and cooked exactly as requested i have also had superb fried truffled mac n cheese as well as nice grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup all the food has been good comfort food and the fat has made it easier to down a few extra cocktails the cocktails are innovative and all of them have always been nicely presented and the flavors have had a clear thought behind it granted i have not liked every single drink i have had here but staff have also been willing to exchange without cost if i have not liked something so a big plus all in all one of my favorite places to grab a drink at in singapore,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,have been here maybe  times over the last  years it is the spot i bring all my guests to show them some cool parts of singapore as you can see from other reviewers the food is great in this hidden spot my reco is the reuben if they still have it on the menu went again last night june  and it was packed not uncommon and found the drinks menu changed again not uncommon i asked for a drink they used to have before as i have  other times called a hard to pour really a fantastic drink was hastily told they couldnt make it the waiters also didnt have any knowledge of their new menu which i was wryly told changes every   months wasnt impressed this time around with the drinks or service a formerly five star place is no longer,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,so i had heard this was the place where the cool kinds hang out and i am not typically one of them but i felt cool here i was not too adventurous with the drinks and stuck with a manhattan it was good but nothing to blow my mind what did nearly change my life was there burger the server strongly recommended it over the ruben we tried both and the burger is one of the best i have had in singapore especially when you consider the price i will for sure come back and eat it again and again and again in general the place is not cheap but once you get that burger on the lips that becomes an afterthought,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,came here with some co workers and had some fabulous drinks there was a drink menu but server asked us what we like in our drinks and suggested things for us i enjoyed his first recommendation and then asked for drinks similar but different at the end i tried three fabulous drinks my co workers and i marveled at the crystal clear ice cubes apparently hand chiseled off of a giant block this is a must visit in singapore,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,i have been back here many times after reviewing it almost  years ago i have been to a few speakeasies in singapore but nowhere compares to hkst the drinks and service crew are far they have recently undergone a renovation it is more spacious and could host bigger groups in cubbyholes the crowd vibe is still a good hipster chic blend love this place and its presidential punch to bits x,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,we initially went to this bar because it is listed as one of the top  bars in the world on the forbes list after scouring the internet i found a contact number i called left a voicemail and received a text from a different phone number to confirm a reservation for the upcoming friday night it all felt so secret and exclusive ha ha i have to be honest one of my very favorite books is the great gatsby my love for gatsby and all things speakeasy greatly contribute to my love for  hks when you arrive the building is nothing special and you do not even realize that it is a bar then the hostess opens the curtain and you are transported into a cool hip atmosphere they have an extensive drink menu it is arranged as an evolution of popular drinks they start with the most basic and work their way through to fresh new and exciting versions there is a key on the menu to indicate the strength of the drink my drink was delicious and presented beautifully  hks also has a variety of appetisers small plates we had the fried macaroni and cheese which was sinfully delicious and reminded me of the texas state fair that is a good thing if you are wondering obviously drinks at  hks are pricey it is a one and done type place it is certainly on our singapore tour for when visitors come to town also be aware no cameras phones allowed i bet jennifer lawrence would love it there,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,miss america homemade pastrami sammy blissif you are lucky you might spot mike in a superman suit and mask this fellow american has done a great deal for the cocktail scene in sg and continues to raise the bar kudos the music can get a bit overly loud at times but i think that is bc i am a granny,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,the cocktails tend to be on the bull side the people rather bearish depending on where you are seated on that subject best to be tipsy asap so time disappears and lights to dim along on a straight line it takes me about   delish drinks to be on that very is traight line but i gotta say i am kind of the opposite of say a bear on the other side the place is self aware of these sentiments because the music gets louder as time passes the food is great perfect if there is no distinction being bear or bull not so otherwise or if you are on a diet,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,one of the best bars i have ever visited creativity on the drinks are unheard of our waitress sarah was kind of enough to provide my friend with another drink because he did not like the one he ordered she then followed up with a great recommendation thereafter the interior design of the bar was cozy and the a c was a plus ill leave a surprise for those who read this the restroom sink definitely would recommend and come back here,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,if you are looking to kickstart a weekend of debauchery this is the place to go located in a stretch amongst chinese sundry shops you would never have guessed that this place was here coming in a group pre order the punch bowl it is pretty massive and it is value for money my to go drinks are old fashioneds and negronis and this place does it pretty well at a  price point your drink comes on a leather coaster nice touch and all the tables are made of marble there are a couple of snacks you could order if you are feeling peckish and there was penhaligon is handsome in the bathroom very nice touch truth be told i am pretty torn about this place the service is superb the staff are really interested in knowing what flavor profiles you like and they will cook it up for you unfortunately there have been a couple of times when i have ordered something else off the menu and it just tasted pretty weak avoid the impish looking bartender he makes the worst drinks,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,first impressions are essential and this bar is way too good at it if at first you take  minutes to find  you are on the right track upon finding it you might be slightly intimidated and overwhelmed but calm down it is not that bad have a drink the cocktails here are superbe and the bartenders too theyre friendly and one can strike up conversation easily with any of them even when one is sober just try it slightly pricey but hey you get bang for your buck here they do the best old fashioned in town in my opinion if youre looking for something girlier sweeter try the tiki elvis complete w bacon on top what is lacking in most bars can also be found here good grub good might be a tad insulting though its way better than good believe me i have eaten there while i was still sober do the burger request for it to be cut into  it enhances the fingerlicking goodness also request for the salty nuts it is the angels bar snack theres lots more i have to say about  but i sha not bore you with my typing any longer come round any weekend and you are bound to find a convert like me paying my respects also if i dont show up they start calling to ask if im ok so shrug,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,i can totally see why this is one of the top  bars in the world the decor was cool some what dimly lit and even though it was really quite quiet on a thursday evening i could really see how this place would look like with a bunch of schnazzy yuppies mingling with the tourists of singapore myself included ending the week on a high note as for the drinks whoah blown away it is tucked away completely non descript but the cocktails are made to measure and absolutely amazing i started off with the boulevardier and ended with the hard to port thank goodness the company i work for was paying for it pricey but worth it,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,lovely speakeasy to sneak into and unwind after a long day at the office my husband took me here on a friday evening to kick start our weekend although we came early we still were not able to snatch a seat at the bar i have really been having bad luck with this lately so we opted for one of the booths we tried two drinks on the menu but sadly i was not impressed i cannot remember the name but i ordered something that was a relative to the sazerac the flavors were there but it was not strong enough for me my husband is drink which i think was a fizzy tasted a bit watered down i ended up ordering off the menu what else a sazerac and the bartender was able to redeem herself then i understand the buzz behind this place and i do like the ambiance it is lovely that singapore can have nice things i do not mind paying upwards of  for a cocktail but if i do it better be strong if the bartenders can just work on that i will be willing to upgrade my rating,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,it is known for being a cocktail bar and it does not disappoint a long list of quirky named cocktails and the new i tried were generally pretty good the choice of food was also very nice and as with the cocktails you had sumany options which came with the twist the lack is done up well and the lack of a signboard and all the action being hidden behind a curtain adds to the aura once inside the decor is nice they try to do a stylish manhattinsh cocktail bar succeed but as a accompanying friend from new york who is quite a party pro commented when she saw the prices it ai not cheap,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,boring very dark and old looking inside friend and i had a drink each she had a cocktail i cannot rem the name but it tasted like there wasnt much alcohol in it and she also commented it was bland and uninteresting i had an old fashioned granted it was my first ever but it tasted just like rum on the rocks think they were too light on the bitters both drinks were  to  service when booking was good place was very nondescript outside it was a bit hard to get their intention inside lacklustre is the word we were disappointed with our drinks and agreed we could not be fussed to come back,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,hong kong street is one of the first post mad men speakeasy bars in singapore its been around since  even though its not a big secret and it is relatively easy to find due to the name pointing to the exact address it is still clearly a speakeasy there are no signs pointing towards it and the door is not inviting to someone just passing by you need to go there with a purpose and preferably with a reservation we were there on a monday and despite that not being the busiest day of the week they only had a few tables available the service was first class from the start we were shown to our table and the waiter explained the menu of the night there was a visiting bartender behind the counter and he was making some of his own specials the fun names of the cocktails and eccentric mixes caught our eye this is not the place to order just a basic mojito i ordered a shrub you long time with strawberry infused gin with some orange dry sherry and a balsamic finish it was delicious although my date did not like it my companion ordered the hulk smash mainly because of the wonderful name but also due to the ingredients it was served in a smashed tin cup to sweeten the deal we also had a singapore based friend with us and he first ordered a old fashioned liked drink and on the first sip realized he did not at all like it staff were however very attentive and noticed that it was perhaps not what he would preferred and they straight away offered him to exchange it for something else without any cost big plus for being so attentive and the great service attitude as i mentioned it was a monday so one drink was enough however the menu was long and inviting so i could imagine spending the whole evening here we did not have any food but i eyed the burgers passing by our table and they looked delicious next time i will have something salty to match my drinks,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,another speakeasy joint in sg really reminded me a bit of comstock in sf although not totally the same but the waiter guy was dressed up a bit the drinks were great and you know its great when there are quite a few ingredients in the drink that sounds totally fancy foreign and you have no idea what the heck it is we also got the fried truffle mac n cheese balls pork belly sliders and chicken and waffles as a vegetarian i just had the mac n cheese and the waffle part of the chicken n waffles and the bourbon syrup that came along w the chicken n waffles was amazballs since our group ordered quite some drinks we got  of our appetizer orders on the house i thought that was uber nice we did not get to try the punch bowl at sgd but its a big big bowl since you need to pre order it so i am def going back next time for the punch,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,hidden fake speakeasy with excellent cocktails but a bit too pretentious also too pricey for what it is this is more expensive than drinks in nyc and sf where i am from,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,a dimly let chic indoor environment with a garage door exterior  hong kong street is another one of these cocktail establishments which seem to be spreading like wildfire it is a nice environment well decorated with a small bar and a good list of cocktails while the vibe is good if you balk at singapore is beer prices you might want to skip out on cocktail establishments on this island all cocktails are north of  and the beers are  a bottle the cocktail i tried was the nuevo i think which had some coffee in there and vanilla alcohol it was alright but i am not a huge cocktail person to begin with the fried mac n cheese balls were good but the pecan pie is average the chicken and waffles are more like chicken nuggets on a waffle with no option for gravy just syrup we came on a thursday and the place had a good crowd so i would imagine it is even busier on weekends all in all a good place to have a drink or two,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,good friend took me here to explore a new restaurant she is been here before and told me this is one of the world is top  best bar this place is very hidden you will not notice it from the outside and wo not even bother to take a look at it since there is no sign no name and it looks like it is closed i am serious food wise we ordered the buttermilk chicken and the reuben a beef sandwich both taste good especially the reuben do not expect it to be served with style it feels more like finger food but taste good good for after work and weekend hang out,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,went here on a tuesday night after chinese new years with a couple friends pros sf style speakeasy some say old and dark but i say it is got atmosphere lol awesome bumping music old skool hip hop n r b z great attentive service they checked in on us gave us water without asking even split the bill a far cry from other places where you have to wait ages or shout to get a drink i almost felt like i was in america again p true speakeasy entrance you would not know there is a bar there aside from the large  on top it looks like your average garage door cons you have to make reservations it is small and not many tables   drinks they are good but i mean really you are only supposed to charge those prices if you are super creative like bar stories or on some ridiculously nice rooftop bar like lantern other considerations it is loud the music is loud the crowd is loud or maybe just tonight,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,only the cool and hip can hang out here overpriced fancy drinks get the punch bowl its the most bang for your buck i love the dark wood and the bar that is the best part of the joint it is a huge hassle to get in unless you have a reservation so beware it was apparently named  top bars in the world hmmm hopefully the food is better than the air conditioner strength in this joint will have to try it out next time,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,i really enjoyed this place when we went there was a guest bartender from australia so we were able to try drinks that were not on the regular menu it seems like you need a reservation to get a table but i did not mind sitting at the bar i loved watching the bartenders make the drinks we tried the chips and the mac and cheese bites and we enjoyed both snacks as well would definitely recommend if you are looking for a fun craft cocktail bar,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,sexy shady smooth downtown back alley film noir brown cocktails suits suave subdued romantic and it is pretty cool i enjoyed being here and that is saying something because i do not really drink following those adolescent days as a punky kid in the uk smuggling beers around in backpacks and spending long dizzy nights stomping to discordant music there had to come a reprieve that reprieve ironically for some came in those university years where lessons in drinking in moderation were tested and many blurred moments were spent in fields between trees and by rivers with the stars gazing the moon beaming and the clouds rolling overhead university in the countryside is just like university in the city but much less raucous eventually drinking in bars becomes a redundancy what does a bar offer you but stale air overpriced drinks and cyclic conversation i guess this bar offered that too but it is a bit shady and that swings opinion in its favour,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,i do not know if it is because it is my first speakeasy experience or what but i really like this place the decor is nice the cocktails were decent though a bit pricy if you are in a moderate group   or just plan to drink a lot i would recommend getting their punch bowl for a more economically responsible choice i have heard friends dishing out  per person here just because they got too drunk to count and if you do get the punch bowl i would choose the one with gin more potent and tasty towards the later part of the night they sometimes give food away to random tables i thought this was a nice touch and the food the food was really good i looooove the truffle mac and cheese balls and their reuben sandwich all in all i would not make it my regular hangout but a special place to bring a visiting guest every now and then,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,as i was looking for a proper cocktail thanks to the yelp app i came across  hong kong street as i was in the area there are no signs for the place like a true speakeasy and once you enter you are in a very classy joint the liquor selection is impressive with perhaps the best collection of american bourbon and rye whiskeys in asia and many of the bottles are even difficult to find in the us i started off with an rye old fashioned with high west rye and it was perfect not too sweet not too much citrus and really allowing the rye to shine as a fan of barrel aged cocktails i was very interested in trying their negroni which was super smooth after spending at least  weeks in a barrel i ended the evening with a martinez and a shot of mezcal which they also have definitely a place for cocktail fans and geeks alike  hong kong street is world class bar with a great selection and some serious talent,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,so so cool yes you did not read it wrong the name of the bar is also the address which is almost exactly the website which features nothing more than its name and an email address that is not a link for a place that only takes reservations which we later found not entirely true since we did walk in and get a table for  they did not pick up any of my calls all day cementing the nonchalant nature of just getting in might have been just me finally stepping in though throws you off completely the outside street is relatively quiet at night but once you get in the doors it is a different world the place is dark and decked out like a bar from a different time the actual bar is an interesting triangle and has loads of specialty liquor take your time to look through the menu or just speak to one of the front of house ladies they will set you up with some ridiculous drinks the names you will remember are the whore is bath and the corpse reviver and there is a reviver  too if you end up with a bigger crew try to punch bowl it is massive and may take you a while if you like a bit of a drink you should give it a go at least once then you can say you have moved on,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,where else can you bathe with a whore and leave smelling like ladies breath and not get in trouble with your wife love this speakeasy it is a great chilled place to spend a fancy night sipping delicious specialty cocktails in a padded velour booth this is definitely the night to wear high heels and red lipstick,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,nice place outside and inside drinks are not bad but prices are not reasonable i paid  for single shot of whiskey,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,after a long summer away from singapore this was the waterhole everyone was talking about in september when i got back however more recently i have heard more negative reviews at present this is the bar everyone loves to hate i understand the critique and i think the issue comes down to this if you are a regular as my friends are they take very good care of you if you are a first timer do not expect the same treatment to be perfectly frank i like that in a bar i want to be recognized for my frequent visits that fourth cocktail i buy those late night bar snacks if you come in and do not get great service its not just because we are in singapore it is because you have not put in the time and now for explaining the actual bar in the grand tradition of speakeasies the bar has no signage on the faade inside the small door is a dark corridor to the hostess desk and they let you behind the curtain the room is dimly if not romantically lit by old filament bulbs the booths and tables are quite comfortable if you want to talk to the bartenders the bar area is rather limited but it is worth sitting there so see their vast collection of home infused spirits and liquors i go there for the cocktails my favorite at the moment is the esta noche  it comes with a little plastic syringe filled with the spices rum for making the drink so you can kind of flavor it yourself and the big sprig of rosemary somehow convinces me this is healthy the mac and cheese balls are amazing as is most of the bar food even if you have sworn this place off i recommend you give it one more try go with a group of friends you know appreciate good scotch and cocktails and enjoy the quiet it is a nice place to be a regular,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,a beautiful little gem that you would overlook just walking down hong kong st hip space amazing bartenders and super super nice cocktail waitresses it is a speak easy with some of the best cocktails i have tasted around singapore the drink selection is always new and unique and they will ask you the right questions to fit a drink to your taste and if you are unsure just try the whore is bath cannot think of a better place to impress good friends,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,i drank the whores bathwater it was surprisingly refreshing great ambiance and perfect for conversation entry a hole in the wall,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,it is like a secret speakeasy we had to loiter outside waiting to be accepted into the elite club do not judge a book by its cover cos it is not a closed shop it is livelier yet i finally got inaugurated after a friend hung out long enough and asked for a favour since we could not made a reservation despite calling a few days ahead boy was it cool the drinks the display of the alcohol bottles the bartenders and their mixing action it was hard not to be in awe since we had dinner before drinks it was a pity that we did not get to order food there but the menu was rather interesting and appetising the staff not only take orders they can even recommend based on your preferences it sure is not a quiet bar but hey i feel even more like an insider,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,the atmosphere and service here are top notch it is a great place to have a legit cocktail the bartenders make really delicious well executed drinks this is a great place to start out the night but it is quite pricey so getting properly smashed here is prohibitively expensive though really if you are looking to get drunk these are not exactly the best drinks to do so anyways i would happily return when i am looking for a classier night out,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,this is my second review on that bar i always believe in second chances and after another wonderful dinner in foc almost right next to that bar i decided to go there a second time last time was the opening day after renovation for  hk street so confusion and mixed up drinks seemed ok almost  month later i naively assumed they would have sorted themselves out well shockingly we got a table right away on a saturday i should have left right away because it is never a good sign to get a table in a hot spot anyway we ordered drinks and the fun part of the evening started first the good things they managed to get rid of their weird cucumber water instead they serve normal chilled water very good and promising i yielded at the table next to us they were at their second glass of water now please do not go there when i intend to get drunk you might not manage as they are serving much more water than drinks given they have  bartenders that might sound odd but these guys are so busy trying to cool awesome while shaking the drinks i almost called an ambulance cause one of the guys looked like he had ceasure that your drinks may take a while at least they put in a lot of love so let keep it at the good intention counts now they also have very pretty waitresses  of them that are very kind and polite good thing you do not dare to complain if you have girls that are so friendly new biz case and then there is a supervisor waitress lady her major task is to figure out where the drinks should go one of her ways is to dip a straw into the drink and taste it and then direct it to the right table i was torn between respect and a bit of confusion she must know all the cocktails and their taste by heart to know to which order they fit and if she get insecure she simply has  more waitresses to do the same so if you are lucky or not and there is still some of your drink left you are blessed with a drink that you will never forget one of the drinks revived childhood memories from a day when i accidentally tasted my moms furniture polish mistook it for coke cause it was in a coke can thx mom the drink had exactly the same taste maybe on purpose the other two drinks where also interesting one tasted exactly like mr muscle bathroom cleaner smells i have to say that i am assuming it is not their intention to create that kind of taste and i believe the decreasing number of local and international guests seems to underline my opinion on that i feel  hk street has a serious problem not only with their normal business process which guest are willing to accept when drinks are great but also with their drinks menu it is a pitty i heard a lot good about this place but now i will move on and find another bar maybe it is just not my taste,Negative
28-hong-kong-street,we went to this bar after christmas eve dinner already a little buzzed from a couple drinks at horse is mouth the bar was pretty unassuming from the outside but on the inside you were transported to a different world i am automatically reminded of the speakeasy bars that my friends would take me to in manhattan and got a bit homesick recommended by marcus and louis from horse is mouth the drinks here are pretty tasty and deceptively strong the downside are prices for the drinks but drinking in singapore is pricey sigh,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,from what i see and hear the crowd here are mostly expats people returning from overseas the bar has a good collection on alcohol that you would rarely find in other bars and that is a plus because it allows them to mix up creative drinks although i am sadden by how limited the menu is and i found myself crossing out drink after drink the bartenders here are very keen to whip up something according to your liking i can easily spend many hours here having fun at it,Positive
28-hong-kong-street,trendy hipster bar with really excellent mixed drinks very good bar food the pastrami rueben is to die for interesting classy modern music taste the staff is very good and easy on the eyes reasonably priced for the quality early in the evening the old folks hang out there later on the hip crowd packs in,Positive
foc,foc describes itself as a fun and relaxed spanish restaurant with its roots in the catalonian region precisely barcelona it features exquisite tapas and dishes that will leave you craving for more if you want to be close to the action and witness how every dishes are carefully executed i suggest to take a seat at the bar we ordered sauted cauliflower with pine nuts the octopus galician style and the scallop soy caviar my personal favourite was the cauliflower but all the dishes were definitely satisfying to the palate and quite flavourful we also ordered two specials the suckling pig and the tuna salad again delightful one item we observed being prepared several times and had our attention was the squid ink paella maybe next time enjoy,Positive
foc,went here for dinner last friday excellent tapas place almost all the dishes we had were great especially the patatas bravas and the shrimp in ajillo sauce as well as the iberico ham with scrambled eggs the flaming rum baba was innovative too the only thing that missed the mark were the peppers with salt they were just way too bitter probably should not have ordered them solid   stars overall,Positive
foc,very good spanish tapas place we particularly like the more classic tapas items like garlic shrimp and croquette other dishes e g roasted chicken cauliflower tapas etc are standard good extensive wine selection and good desserts modern lively ambience and decent service a good place to check out for spanish tapas in singapore,Positive
foc,say what catalan cuisine in singapore my life is now complete beautiful plates of tapas and expertly crafted cocktails croquettes croquettes croquettes order dozens the patatas bravas are a favorite of mine these were average cod balls are yet another favorite and these did not disappoint the spanish octopus was perfectly prepared tender three words squid ink paella do it briny sea worthy delight the ambiance is plush rhythmic and romantic,Positive
foc,very good night out great food great service my favorite tonight simply the pane con tomato and ibetico ham the beautifully cooked scallops and the lemon tarte we will be back for sure very solid place,Positive
foc,was not too bad or too good because it is popular you have a time limit to eat your meal we tried  dishes and the one that really hit the mark was the scallop you f you are a penny pincher then do not go if you eat slow then do not go if you enjoy good food and cocktails then it is a must the photo shows squid ink paella nice taste would order again,Positive
foc,excellent food and service we are all small tapas and took their recommendations the atmosphere is great too little pricey and you probably need reservations but worth it,Positive
foc,wanted to add to the reviews as this is now one of the two best restaurants i have been to in singapore hidden away on a not so great street this place is a gem the food was amazing cocktails looked great although i had delicious wine and it was a great ambiance i would highly recommend this place,Positive
foc,who would have thunk it catalan cuisine in singapore my life is now repleat with fullness they serve expertly crafted cocktails and beautiful plates of tapas croquettes croquettes croquettes order scores the patatas bravas are a favorite of mine these were just ok cod balls are yet another favorite and these do not disappoint the spanish octopus was tender and perfectly prepared three words squid ink paella do it briny sea worthy delight the ambiance is rhythmic romantic and plush,Positive
foc,reliably excellent and always crowded have been here multiple times and i would recommend the staples gambas al ajillos croquettas jamon iberico octopus and any of the paellas cocktails are reasonably priced and the wine list has a good variety of spanish wines excellent service as well overall this is probably the best place for tapas in singapore,Positive
foc,not sure i was too happy to pay  for four pieces of bread but other than that the squid ink paella had robust flavors and would come back just for more of that,Negative
foc,this place has a real nyc vibe for restaurants great tapas spot with food from spain the chef is a michelin star chef and his food was legit staff was really nice like everyone in singapore usually is we ordered the lamb chops beef sliders cod fish balls some mushroom dish and i forgot the last item but everything was legit and tasted good would def come here again i would suggest to def make a reservation they book up quick as it is a trendy spot peace from doctor p,Positive
foc,this spanish tapas bar is on point the food is fantastic i wish i could have ordered the entire menu the jamon iberico ham was out of this world the cocktails were fun and delicious,Positive
foc,i get the hype this place is buzzy even on mondays with quirky decor great music and top notch food the cocktail menu does not seem to end and i love how they break it down by easily identifiable flavour profiles like refreshing floral and spirit driven i tried the lord sidecar loved the sage and it was a great starter for a hot and humid day i was surprised at the patatas bravas their rendition had a saucy kick to it the grilled foie gras sliders were very rich definitely a treat meant to be filed under sometimes food only my husband and i were also impressed with the black mediterranean squid ink paella a mouthful to say but when that mouthful is in your mouth it is damn shiok my only constructive feedback was that it was slightly warm where we were sitting we were at the end table opposite the bar kitchen i noticed we were not that far from the ceiling ac unit not sure if it was on at all,Positive
foc,we went here saturday night at about pm the restaurant was busy and the tunes were bumpin seriously i was chair dancing the whole night we went with tapas let is be honest when given the choice why would you not and loved everything we did the ham croquettes beef cheek sliders and sauted cauliflower the ham croquettes may have been the best thing i have ever tasted pricing for food is fair although the wine list gets pretty extravagant although for singapore it seems fairly normal come here you will not be disappointed,Positive
foc,the food throughout the night did not disappoint we had the croquette as a starter minus half a star for not having the foie gras slider when we visited last friday it was a dish i really wanted to try but it was not available we ordered beef slider which was tasty but i guess it was just that the fried squid was definitely tasty however it came in small portion the special of the day cauliflower was really good and crunchy the fish and cheese mac and cheese ball lookalike thing was spot on you gotta try this when you visit another highlight is the black squid ink paella i could come back again just to have a paella to myself if they are not so particular about the whole reservation sms and dining duration the pork ribs were good but not wow overall everything we have ordered that night is above average i would definitely be back to try more dishes minus another half a star for the pain of having to reserve on the phone with the missus who have hearing problem and make a fuss about replying confirmed by pm the next day and endless reminders that we have to leave by certain timing,Negative
foc,i asked my friend ning when she would be free to celebrate her mid november bday and she said let is do dinner this thursday she is busy with med school so she has to seize the day evening she said try foc i had heard of it but had thought another tapas bar ok whatever made bookings early ok left a voice message to callback to add an additional person and they did not call focing service i thought to myself but i called back and they were helpful as can be thereafter it was all uphill we arrived just before pm on a thurs night and the place was getting full we had not asked but they had given us  girls counter seats on the leftmost side of the counter right in front of chef jordi getting to ask him about the food even the ones not destined for us watching him and the other staff hard at work chatting about his recommendations and preferences really added to the experience we had croquetas de setas mushroom croquettes  cuatro unidades  units sorry the nod goes to binomio on this one the batter was slightly overfried but the th piece which i did not eat was noticeably a shade lighter in colour than the other  and the inside was full of bites of maybe porcini mushrooms tasty and mushroomy but binomio wins for the smooth cream filling evenly exuding mushroom flavour both places seem to serve the croquestas on the same dab of garlic mayo incidentally the same garlic mayo dabbed on foc is black rice paella and binomio is squid ink pasta fideua we had a daily special recommended by chef he called it the huevos dish and it was basically potato pieces fried with crispy edges served with an egg on top and in a skillet simple but again very yummy and perfectly seasoned ie not too salty one of ning is and my favourites nadia does not like tomatoes was the watermelon gazpacho with charcoal olive oil ice cream we ordered one portion to share and chef jordi thoughtfully split the ice cream into  separate bowls the gazpacho was incredibly smooth and tasty and tomatoey with just a touch of sweetness from the watermelon nadia does not like tomatoes other than fresh ones in salad or in the background like pizza sauce but she loved the icecream mixed with the gazpacho and ate up every last drop of her portion that is how good it was food was very tasty without being cloyinging rich and greasy which can be the risk of spanish restaurants in spain as well as here the black rice arroz negro with seafood paella  was luscious without visible separated oil unlike binomio and la bomba and sabio the plumpness and bite of the rice was perfect really good quality rice handled well another strong recommendation by chef jordi the grilled ribeye at  was meltingly tender and served medium rare originally i thought he was talking about the kg beef on the bone and i asked erm too much for us  he said no just nice for sharing i was thinking ok maybe we look very hungry and later when i realised it was a ribeye steak portion phew i told him about the intiial misunderstanding and we had a good laugh about it this was g and we were all commenting how tender and juicy and really good the meat was and my other  friends also raved on about the grilled peppers served on the side of it note on the cocktails nadia had the smells like gin spirit  tasty and refreshing gin version of a mojito i had the chef is favourite bloody jordi also  and is a bloody mary type with an asian sour twist looking at the description again that must be the kimuchi no moto korean kimchi base dario the mixologist said it had   shots of tequila in it i could not taste the alcohol but he said it was not meant to be a strong alcohol forward drink it is true the spices and tomato was the prevalent sensation and not everyone will like that flavour combination but it was interesting to try something new my friends all commented it was so savoury like a soup and it did go down very easily i suppose it is a silent killer but i was happy to get on to the excellent house wine i had the angelitos negros  at   a glass after all that chef asked if we wanted a small bite each he then prepared  pieces of scallops topped with their soy caviar tapioca sago so we could have  each when the standard serving is  fresh juicy and plump w slight char  we went through the courses very smoothly all tapas but felt like a proper dinner all the way and happily ended with the chocolate burger at  and the torrija  overall food was fresh not overstated not over seasoned refreshing very yummy but not bludgeoning on the palate a small portion of torrija with a candle and with happy birthday written in dulce de leche on the plate was served complimentary and unexpectedly even the valet from purple valet waited to close all our doors for us as we got into the car i do not know if that is part of the restaurant training but kudos,Positive
foc,outstanding each dish we had was phenomenal and the drink was icing on the cake fabulous and will be back,Positive
foc,lucky to snatch a seat at the bar on a thursday night always wanted to visit foc and the food did not disappoint food is on the pricier side although i think the clientele probably wo not blink an eye at the price service is great although for some reason the couple dishes i ordered came out a bit saltier than im used to maybe i will ask for less salt next time,Positive
foc,great cocktails and great food do try their crackling pork and their paella superb rsvp is a must eventhough it is for weekdays,Positive
foc,been to foc twice staff is very friendly and helpful plates are sometimes removed quite quickly but then again you want the space for the next dish the food is amazing hands down dishes are well presented and are inviting to look at while having a conversation if you have the choice sit at the bar it makes the experience all the more intense and inspiring as you see all the different things the kitchen staff prepares and they look amazing we had in no particular order oysters daily special beef cheek special scallops peppers bread with tomatoes omg in terms of drinks you should try the bloody jordi a slimmed down house special version of a bloody mary it is good it is really good on a personal note for me a great restaurant is not only about service and food it is what they do to encourage you back first time around a had mixup on my bill that i only claimed later foc staff was really really helpful and things were resolved to satisfaction in no time no hard time no stalling i will be back at foc worth your time and every penny spent thank you foc,Positive
foc,one of the best dinners i have had in singapore service was flawless food was amazing worth every cent great for a fun night out when you are in the mood to splurge a little total bill for  came up to  incl gst service charge without drinks we had mushroom croquettes  for  served fresh each croquette can be finished off in  delightful bites the inside is a gooey mess of cheese cream and mushrooms wonderful starter to whet your appetite squid ink paella  perfect for sharing also gorgeously photogenic each grain of rice was plump and flavorful and mixed with hidden octopus chunks which was a pleasant surprise it was topped with juicy prawns and clams and dollops of aioli we wiped the pan clean i must confess i never was a fan of paellas but this one hit the ball out of the park grilled octopus  juicy octopus nestled on a bed of flavorful mashed potato topped with paprika only minor gripe was that some parts were so charred that i ended up tasting more bitterness from the burnt bits than the actual octopus the octopus itself on the other hand was tender and meaty absolutely delicious iberico pork ribs pumpkin mash  our least favorite dish of the night perhaps also because we were getting pretty full by then and this dish ended up feeling too heavy the ribs were very fatty and the savory pork did not go that well with the sweet pumpkin it was decent on the whole though chocolate galaxy  they bring the chocolate dome to the table and pour hot chocolate syrup over it on front of you so you watch as the chocolate shell melts to reveal  mini profiteroles within ended up being essentially a chocolate soup with  cream filled profiteroles we did not think we would be able to finish it but we did there were crunchy bits at the bottom which was a nice touch great for sharing did not manage to try this time but i have also heard good things about the mini chocolate burger and the watermelon gazpacho will definitely return love this restaurant,Positive
foc,quite frankly i am not sure why this restaurant averages  stars on yelp of all the dishes we had tonight only the cauliflower and duck confit were good scallops came out completely raw in the middle asparagus were overcooked to the point of being mushy not to mention we were served the fibrous bottom if you are going to serve the bottom of the asparagus then you may want to shave it cuttlefish paella with saffron came out crunchy and looking completely brown and absent of any saffron the rice was so undercooked and it tasted very muddled i have never seen saffron flavored rice to be brown why would you cover up the nice yellow color of saffron maybe it is a false item in the description and none was ever used beef cheek burger was okay and lamb chops were bland,Negative
foc,craft cocktails and small plates with a western theme come to mama they impressed me when i walked in the door the hostess squeezing me in on the spot despite no real opening for quite awhile the waitstaff was fantastic all around the cozy atmosphere the view of the kitchen and bar and the hustling of the staff gave the place quite a bit of positive energy the eclectic decor included a couple of large colorful busts looking down which was vaguely reminiscent of carnival quite a range of libations i did sample a couple i was honestly a bit disappointed with the smells like gin spirit i was hoping for a cocktail like an aviation but got something i would expect at a new orleans sno ball stand instead perhaps fitting for a balmy singapore evening though the don martinez however was smoking on many levels tequila based deliciousness an extensive selection of spanish themed tapas that you would expect adorned the menu i am sure they are delicious but i went for the world tapas instead delicate scallops pulled pork mini tacos and beef cheek sliders every item i ate they completely nailed i loved the dessert burger i will admit that when i first saw a picture i thought it a bit contrived and scoffed at the notion but decided to try it anyway it was so cute the delicateness of the dish made it more reminiscent of a toddler is toy cheeseburger rather than a slider strawberry tomato and mint lettuce added to the effect a nice thin chocolate shell crunch with a light creamy filling it was pleasing to the palate as well as the eye bravo,Negative
foc,we had five dishes baby squid w aioli scallops pulled pork sliders pork belly and cauliflower foie gras slidersabsolutely love the sous vide pork belly and creamy cauliflower pure dish cant stop thinking about the playful foie gras and shiitake sliders or the buttery pulled pork buns scallops were good but slightly overlook from the ponzu skip the baby squid the batter on the squids were thick and made it heavy,Positive
foc,amazing place never thought there would be a place like this in my home town of singapore i have been a fan of good tapas since my movida experience in melbourne and so those familiar with that place we have our very own cool tapas bar on our own door step now its been almost a week since i have been there and i still remember the dishes i had the suckling pig is not something they have everyday if they have it on the menu the day you are there have it i cannot name many occasions when pork has melted in my mouth the anchovies on coca bread is a must try as is the braised beef and that foie gras you want that flavor to stay in your mouth forever here is my other recommendation if you are in small group ask to sit at the bar its not only about watching the cocktails being served up but also watching the chef and esc prepare all the dishes in the kitchen its certainly part of the experience,Positive
foc,there is a blazing fire that is out to turn up the heat on hongkong street and that is foc restaurant a new spanish dining concept and cocktail bar foc is an inspired collaboration between michelin starred chef nandu jubany chef jordi noguera formerly from foodbar dada and award winning mixologist dario knox previously from catalunya restaurant yes it is a star studded team expect a contemporary small plates menu with catalan and mediterranean influences complemented by a selection of inventive cocktails they even created a selection of asian inspired tapas which were honestly pretty darn good hits cochifrito crispy pork taco  pcs this is one of my favorites if not the top favorite dish this is foc is take on the mexican taco and that crispy shell was too addictive it is like a really awesome fried wanton skin filled with tender pulled pork i really liked the crispy pulled pork i did not even mind the dou miao and i do not even like bean sprouts now could we have this in jumbo size or what bocata de foie gras a la brasa y shitake marinado grilled foie gras with marinated shitake and green apple  pcs loved that broiche bun with a glossy blistered exterior it was very crunchy and extremely buttery even though the foie gras was on the oily side it had a nice creamy texture and i liked that the green apples added that tinge of tartness foc hamburguesa de chocolate foc chocolate burger  now here is one carefully crafted dessert burger made from white chocolate vanilla mousse strawberries and mint leaves you should eat it all together for a balanced review of this dessert the combined flavors of the smoky caramel sweet milk chocolate and the tart strawberries were delightful the cream in the bun had a marshmallow texture too drinks innovative strong and very affordable they start at  and cocktails are available all day say wertttt missesvieiras con caviar de soja scallops soy caviar  it is scallops and it is nicely seared and it is in a salty soy there is really nothing else to it cansalada confitada con pure de coliflor confited pork belly with cauliflower puree  pcs bland fatty bleah give me that cauliflower puree on its own,Positive
foc,food was not as good as before e g prawns were cooked too much and octopus lost its unique texture staff serving a black ink paella advised us to be careful as the pan was very hot but it turned out to be almost cold hahaha it was served too late however i was pretty satisfied with wine selection and overall ambience will i visit again not sure,Negative
foc,been to foc hong kong street several times in general the food is excellent especially the squid ink paella as well as the desserts alcoholic drinks on menu are also very good i think this place has one of the best pisco sours i have had in singapore but the seats are too close to each other and the acoustics of the place is horrible it is difficult to hear conversations at the table,Positive
foc,flawless meal and one of the best i have had in singapore if you can try to sit at the bar so you can watch in awe as the chefs prepare plates and the bartenders make drinks what i had pork tacos when they first arrived i was surprised at how small they were but as soon as i took the first bite i no longer wished for anything bigger there was so much flavour packed into these little bite sized tacos i am still craving them a day later potatoes bravos delicious and delicate a perfect starter that will not fill you up but will make you anxiously await your next plate grilled octopus wow all i can say is wow perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned with a perfect char i have had quite a bit of octopus and this rivals the best i have had french toast and ice cream dessert how can you go wrong with this it is a perfectly sweet dessert that is not too sweet and not too heavy a great way to finish a great meal smells like gin spirit i was hoping for a nice refreshing cocktail and that is exactly what i got i am not much of a gin guy but decided to try this out and was pleasantly surprised,Positive
foc,i came here with my family during our singapore trip we had some laksa earlier that morning but my brother was super adamant about going to foc for lunch the decor was pretty cool some weird light sculptures in the back my nephew was quite fascinated by them the service was impeccable our waiter was super awesome the food was equally awesome we ordered the following things ham croquette octopus galican style squid ink paella grilled iberico pork ribs pork belly cauliflower puree cod fish fritters grilled scallops with soy caviar foie gras sliders honestly everything was really good highly recommend the squid ink paella,Positive
foc,delicious food and great service for singapore the portions are very precious but the food is flavorful and well prepared i will gladly return,Positive
foc,had dinner here on a friday on a reservation made  weeks earlier was expecting another overrated tapas place but was pleasantly surprised the winners for me were the beef cheek sandwich patatas bravas and crispy pork tacos would have loved to try their scallop ceviche with guacamole and grilled scallop but both were not available finished off with the tarta tatin done with a modern twist which was agreeable with me they have an interesting well priced and fairly extensive cocktail menu complete with a taste guide alas the cocktail itself was very average had the red sangria which tasted rather like grape juice with added sugar the service here deserves commendation efficient and smiley a rarity in sg i will be back,Negative
foc,i had one of the best vacations a couple of years ago cycling around the catalan region eating affordable and excellent food everywhere from michelin starred restaurants which i am not sure is the best way to assess the more traditional dishes but then again this region was under french protection at one point to a home kitchen the food in catalunya is fantastic if food was reason alone for granting autonomy i say why not anyway let is leave the politics aside and talk about foc i did not visit can jubany in osona but i bet foc is equally good spanish food by the spanish not too pricey and portions were sufficient here is looking at you serenity i was craving some fideu which is like the ang moh version of hokkien prawn mee and the chef gamely obliged with his rendition of squid ink fideu it was very tasty with a good amount of wok hei we also had the croquettes which had mashed potatoes so mashed it was practically a mouth watering puree sardines with pickles gives your palate a good puckering up fresh and very sweet tomatoes the potatas bravas kinda skimpy on the seasoning and not greasy which i kind of associate with the dish but hey this will do and the battered cod fish balls with apple puree interesting but kind of mushy with not too distinctive flavors i e i could not tell it was cod up to this point the food came out at a steady pace and then we had a long wait i checked on the waiter and realized the kitchen had forgotten our grilled octopus and the egg with pork belly and truffle special while the clock was ticking on when we had to vacate our seats because of the two cover policy and because i had a show to catch at the art house the octopus was served shortly and much as i had hyped up my dining partner on the wonders of spanish octopuses they are in fact ridiculously taught smoky crisp and mind blowing the foc version kind of disappointed time in the josper grill somehow robbed the octopus of its juices though i liked the char on top so this was an ehhh dish that could have been so much better the eggs with pork belly and truffles what a combo right never came and i think i actually paid for it in my haste i did not check the bill thoroughly but on hindsight at  and some quick math off the website i think i was charged for the dish that never went into my belly even though i would have loved to taste it finally a note on the cocktails i had the cuzco sour because if you have hiked all over peru you would have romantic memories of this lovely drink not so much of the chicha it was very balanced the right amount of tart lime lemon and the requisite egg whites and bitters on top my second drink was a bangkok something which i asked the waiter to recommend based on my preference for something refreshing it ended up being almost exactly the same as the sour except for some supposed chilli is that were mild to non existent maybe i am being a little picky but the mark of front of house would be one that watches both your food and drink selections and offers pairings that work with the food or takes you in a different direction from your first i felt the team fell short here though it is not surprising given how busy the restaurant was nonetheless i enjoyed my meal at foc probably because the food and drinks came soon enough that i was willing to over look the slow service towards the end and the incorrect billing,Positive
foc,i feel a little self conscious giving foc only three stars amidst all the   star reviews so far the bad first since it weighs heavily on my mind i hate that they do two sittings one at  pm and the other at like  it is ridiculous some of us work till  ish  and there is no way we can wait till  to have dinner so the only time i have eaten at foc is for a work dinner when the entire office got off work early just so we could eat here other than with such special arrangements i am basically never going to be able to dine here on a weekday the food was good not mind blowing not amazing just good and not even enthusiastically good granted i did not order items off the menu we had a pre ordered selection of the menu because we were such a big group but i think we hit many of the popular items the octopus was good but not the best or second best i have had in singapore the eggs scrambled at the table with fried potatoes brilliant idea but the hot plate was not hot enough to actually cook the eggs so we had very raw egg white slightly cooked egg yolk and brilliantly crisp potato bits the watermelon gazpacho was tasty and very addictive and i would definitely order it again if i do go back the seafood paella was popular with some though the seafood taste got a bit overpowering by the   spoonful mushroom croquettas brilliant creamy practically fall apart croquettas with a strong distinct mushroom taste really good but better than a good creamy jamon croquetta unfortunately no so maybe you will enjoy foc more than i did if you are a fan of cocktails i did not order any because i was driving and was having wine but right now i would rather head to una for my tapas fix,Positive
foc,we went to dinner here on a friday night the decor is cool hip feels like a trendy bar tapas place in manhattan we started with a cocktail that was excellent probably the best i have had in singapore smells like gin spirit which was a perfect start off the night cocktail as it was herby and refreshing hubby had the special gin and tonic which he really liked we had  or so tapas our favorites were the toasted bread and tomatoes and croquettas classic that are hard to do wrong but were both very good the black paella was only okay honestly the paella at pasar bella is better the french toast for desert was very good carmelized chewy french toast with vanilla ice cream and a great way to end the night i will be back but might make it a cocktails and a couple of starters thing versus an entire night as there are just so many places to try in singapore,Positive
foc,for a new ish restaurant foc is already running like a well oiled establishment the staff knew the menu inside out so they were able to make spot on recommendations the arrival of our courses were timely and our water glasses were kept topped up with big smiles as for the catalan food at foc it was indeed superb traditional but executed with an effortless flair so while dishes seldom deviate from the classics flavours are rich hearty and soulful it is pricey but no more expensive than any other spanish restaurants aroundwe had  heuvos estrellados con chorizo  a breakfast hash of fried potatoes chorizo balls and a just cracked egg still sizzling on the hotplate smoosh it all together and you get a glorious mess of runny eggy delight our favourite tapas here  croquetas de setas con jamon  for  a mixed platter of mushroom croquettes and spanish ham croquettes bursting with creamy goodness and tempered with the contrast of the soft mash and crunchy breadcrumbed coat  tortilla abierta con trufa y pimientos del piquillo  an open tortilla with blistered red peppers truffle strips and aioli was simple but done fantastically it was just the right balance of rich aioli aromatic truffle sweet peppers and eggy pancake  gambas al ajillo  a classic of sauteed prawns in white wine and garlic notable for  things the copious use of really good white wine which made this the most heady rendition ever i think i got a little high from this and incredibly sweet prawns still with shells on for maximum flavour infusion to the sauce a tip get bread to mop all the deliciousness up  vieiras a la brasa con caldo de bonito y caviar de soja  a couple of fat succulent scallops grilled to a beautiful caramelization and dunked into a delicate bonito stock and topped with soy beads great fusion of asian flavours costillas de cerdo a la brasa con pure de calabaza ahumada  seriously good premium iberico pork ribs burnished with rosemary were grilled to a juicy smoky finish and sided by a smoked pumpkin puree  arroz negro con mariscos y all i oli  perhaps the best squid ink paella i have ever had the moreish squid ink was nuanced and countered with the creamy bite of aioli you cannot quite see it but there was as much rice as there was squid dice so that is really amazingly generous,Positive
foc,from start to finish every item was perfectly executed cocktails were also amazing but very small for the price,Positive
foc,it is a smallish place but with a confident attitude about it the cocktail list was never ending and i tried a couple they were both excellent the tapas was very nice as well bcoz we had a few vegetarians in the group we stuck to mostly vegetarian and still i loved it the cheese platter was excellent overall a good lace to go again but it is not cheap,Positive
foc,it is interesting to see what passes for tapas in singapore but foc really nails it down with some excellent selection of very unique plates as well as the classics we actually just left the ordering to our server who planned the following dishes jamon iberico scallops with soy caviar and bonito stock beef cheek sliders and slow cooked octopus we really appreciated the thicker slices of jamon iberico which allows one to fully savor the cured ham the scallops were outstanding and totally worth the price of  for a pair the beef cheek sliders was my least fave very good flavor but not a big fan of the texture and i loved how the octopus was paired with some earthy potato i will definitely come back to try some of the classic tapas but the first visit was definitely solid their bar program is also way above average for a restaurant with some really interesting house cocktails but i tend to stick with the classics and i was very happy with the americano made with amer picon the place gets packed and with good reason definitely a fun place that also takes their food and drinks seriously the small plates can definitely add up but it is also well worth the price,Positive
foc,this little restaurant and bar was a surprise to find in singapore the service was beyond exceptional and the food was fantastic my favorite was the beef sliders with kimchi,Positive
foc,this is where spa aired come to eat so that is all said try chaparillo arros negre and the wines,Positive
foc,perfect place for intetactive eating definitely want to get a reservation try for the group tables you never know who you might meet,Positive
foc,this restaurant is just awesome where do i start first of all its a good idea to reserve a table or seats depending if you are interested to see how they make the food or if you just want to sit and relax with your friends the decor is cool reminds me of the cool kid clubs in berlin and the service awesome the food you might want to go for exercise before you enter the sinful temple of culinary highlights as you will most likely eat more than usual because its just so good usually i sit at the bar and let the boss decide what he is going to serve me as so far he never disappointed from the gazpacho to the clams over the chorizo to the creme catalan which is a must have everything is just amazing i have been to barcelona and never had such amazing tapas the way the food is combined the flavours the consistency and structure is very different surprising and every time like a food symphony what i personally like is that the way the spices are used is so balanced that i do not need to put on extra salt or any other sauce for me that means that a dish is perfect and that is extraordinary drinks their wine and beer selection is quite good but i normally stick to my two favourite cocktails old fashion churchill and bloody jordy which if you like body mary is a must have too last but not least i went there once with a colleague who is vegetarian and even for him there was a lot of choice and he really enjoyed the food too i will keep coming back the prices are reasonable for this kind of haute cuisine simply a great restaurant,Positive
foc,after all the buzz the reality was disappointing the chef seems to love to put huge amounts of salt on everything we sent the cod back because it was so salty that it was not edible when the lamb arrived equally as salty we just gave up and left half of it untouched,Negative
328-katong-laksa,when trying to discover the best laksa in singapore locals always pointed me to katong laksa so i had to give it a try this spot started as a hawker stand and blew up to having  locations now the food is so good that its attracted many celebrities and hype with the news the service is quick and snappy and this location fortunately has ac the laksa itself has a slighter milder taste but it is perfectly balanced with the seafood while sporting a nice spicy kick the noodles are also cut so you eat it with a soup spoon chopsticks are not even offered in addition to the laksa you can even pair it with otah or nasi lemak for not much more overall this was my favorite laksa spot i have tried and i highly recommend giving here a try,Positive
328-katong-laksa,did not know this place was so popular after walking in and seeing all of these famous people is photos plastered on the wall thought for sure it will be great in their laksa they do not use chicken or shrimp they use blood clams or also called cockles it was really spicy so i could only eat a few spoonfuls before giving up not sure i would be back as i cannot take the heat,Negative
328-katong-laksa,sweared by locals that this is the best laksa place in singapore so i had to give it a try this place looks like a fast food joint where you go up to the counter and order what you would like to eat and your name will be called when your food is ready there were  specials that you could order but mostly people just order the laksa in either small or large the large was split between my cousin and myself for about  sgd which is reasonable for a big bowl of laksa the broth was very creamy and noodles were cooked al dente this place only gives you spoons to eat your bowl but is easy to do so overall recommend this place if you are wanting to try some good laksa while in singapore,Positive
328-katong-laksa,in my previous sgp trip i had a great experience eating here this time around it was still satisfying but they skimped on the ingredients the sign of an over hyped industrialized tourist spot also i noticed the pictures of anthony bourdain has been removed from the wall what a shame the posters of other celeb visitors such as gordon ramsay martin yen samantha brown are still there just as i remembered got the standard laksa again the broth was still excellent as i remembered rich creamy smooth spicy but it only contained basic ingredients such as some bean sprouts a few cockles no other seafood e g shrimps unless you pay extra standard katong style short rice noodles that can be eaten with a spoon no chopsticks needed the  nasi lemak wrapped in leaf very forgetable rice was dry not much flavor even with their samba sauce it also contained a sorry looking piece of small dry fish overall the broth of their laksa is still one of the best i have ever had i just do not like the fact that they took advantage of their fame skimped on other ingredients i ate at multiple good laksa places including its equally famed competitor across the street as well as the trishaw laksa in hon lim center they both had descend amount of seafood in their standard basic laksa,Negative
328-katong-laksa,perfect michelin fast food for sgd this dish is made to be used with spoon only so you have some of the soup and broken noodles in one spoonful a bit spicy with a coconut milk flavor to calm the heat no napkins around here popular during lunch rush hour this is how laksa should taste,Positive
328-katong-laksa,had to have laksa in singapore and was told this is a place to try they said if there is a lot of celebrity pictures on the wall then it is probably a good place to eat there is nothing super fancy about the laksa except that it taste awesome i also had otah for the first time which is surprisingly good,Positive
328-katong-laksa,i really enjoyed the large bowl of laksa not too spicy the chili paste adds an interesting zing to the flavor the lime juice was very good as well i also ordered the shrimp siu mai the siu mai goes well with the chili paste,Positive
328-katong-laksa,the best laksa period living in toronto where you can virtually order any cuisine you wish i thought i knew what good laksa was after visiting  katong laksa it is officially ruined all other laksa for me located in a small restaurant this self serve joint is a no fuss type of establishment what is interesting is they do not provide chopsticks you are expected to slurp down your laksa with no other utensil other than your spoon not sure if this made everything taste better but this bowl was the best tasting laksa i have had even after trying several laksa joints in previous days the spicy kick and the creaminess of the broth provided a beautiful base to the noodles and seafood that soaked up all the flavor the serving was just enough to get you full although i wish i had room to try the other items tip bring tissue to wipe off sweat from the spice,Positive
328-katong-laksa,great bowl of laksa there is good seafood flavors with the bowl my only complaint is there is not enough seafood there is really only a few small pieces of mussels in there overall really good bowl of noods it is cash only fyi,Positive
328-katong-laksa,the laksa is the absolute bomb gordon ramsey even went to this location his picture is on the wall of shame the siu mai and the chili crab pau aka steam buns is a must order you can eat the noodles with a soup spoon ask for chop sticks and they say no,Negative
328-katong-laksa,their original laksa was so good you probably wo not find another laksa place better than this one and it is not just a hype the noodles are cut for you so can use a spoon to scoop out the spoonfuls of goodness this katong style laksa is filled with big prawns fish cake cockles mushrooms and topped with some coriander with a light coconut milk that is not too overpowering for visitors like me who grew up in north america we tend to lose a bit of appetite when traveling to hot cities like singapore  degrees that day i was there so i only ordered a small bowl since i was not sure if i could finish it on my own immediately after the first sip of the soup i regret not ordering something bigger i fell in love with the soup immediately and the temperature inside or outside did not bother me at all and was actually quite comforting a little sweaty after but not too crazy i wish i knew how to make this at home so i can enjoy this everyday i will definitely come back when i visit singapore again,Positive
328-katong-laksa,my first experience with laksa curry noodle soup and this place lives up to its hype as a  michelin star restaurant the broth was delicious and i could not stop eating despite wiping the sweat off my brow after every couple of bites i have a low tolerance for spicy food the place it unassuming cozy and prefers to have its food speak for itself what a nice piece of memory in katong,Positive
328-katong-laksa,shiok is truly the only word to describe this place although i suppose you could debate that personal preference plays a part in the singapore v penang style laksa battle i think katong laksa is miles ahead of all else the broth is deliciously bold with seafood coconut and curry flavors the noodles come cut so you can enjoy each spoonful with the perfect combination of soup and noodles cheap delicious authentic yum,Positive
328-katong-laksa,i came from hawaii to taste the original laksa that made my mouth water when i ate it in honolulu i was disappointed again fame baby remember my name made this place famous and is again part of its notoriety downfall soup tasty seafood i had a hard time locating the shrimp that was in their photos minimal noodles ok but i am used to two kinds the nasi lemak rice was a pleasant surprise,Negative
328-katong-laksa,the  katong laksa here is overrated the staff are rude and proud maybe because they are one of the most famous laksa store in singapore i feel that the laksa here is normal there are certainly many other better laksa around in singapore,Positive
328-katong-laksa,came by for breakfast after a couple suggestions from locals ordered the small laksa and did not quite get the hype at   sgd there was a small bowl of coconut curry noodles that actually quite thick the bowl was  noodles with a few tiny shrimps and fish cake took a few bites and went on with my day not quite sure i get the hype with laksa,Negative
328-katong-laksa,this was my first time trying laksa and it was pretty good at this restaurant there are two options for laksa large or small the large is   and the small is   i found the small to be plenty my husband had large and he did not finish it all they also have some appetizer items which we did not try you might want to bring your own napkin as you have to buy them for  cents if you need them,Negative
328-katong-laksa,my nose did not stop running the whole time i ate this laksa not pepper burn hot but more chili nose run hot once you start you cannot stop very addictive and tasty for my fellow americans do not be afraid of the fish cake not what i expected was very good my first laksa experience was a winner,Negative
328-katong-laksa,supaya dapat sim surat ijin mancing next trip sogok dulu pemilik sim dengan  katong laksa yang hmmmm wangi dan enaknya food   service  price place   halalrest  katong laksalocation east coast roadcity singapore,Positive
328-katong-laksa,this spot was convenient since it was right across the street from our hotel the laksa was tasty and delicious,Positive
328-katong-laksa,this is my new favorite hunt never really tried katong laksa before and it damn well blew our mind we had  big bowls of laksa  otahs chili crab bun and barbecue chicken bun they all tasted amazing of course the laksa is a league on its own very creamy coconut gravy without overly powering we added   of chilli packets and damn we were in laksa heaven every bite and slurp left us wanting for more and before we knew it we almost done with our bowl i have always knew bout the joint and the owner since she is a well known food celebrity and have always seen her on tv when i was young never really thought of going to this joint till today well she definitely deserved that celebrity status for this bowl of laksa that she created the otahs was served piping hot and it tasted really good i might get smashed in the face for saying that otah is better than mexican tamale but i still gonna say it no matter what the service was top top the guy at the counter was really friendly and sweet overall we had a totally wonderful experience eating this out of this world singaporean classic thank you  for your great food and kind service you guys made our bellies really happy,Positive
328-katong-laksa,i went to  katong laksa with my fiance several times in  when we were in singapore i still dream of this laksa and the cold fresh lime juice to wash it down with i have never found laksa as good as the one at  katong i definitely preferred the singapore laksa over the penang style i had in malaysia this laksa is one of the only reasons i would go back to singapore,Positive
328-katong-laksa,hands down they serve the best laksa in singapore they deserve all the accolades they get i suggest ordering the laksa with otah a small is sufficient for lunch the otah has a nice saltiness to it and helps balance some of the spice of the laksa the laksa noodles are cut perfectly so you wo not need chopsticks i do not think they offer chopsticks even if you ask the location is clean and casual the service is efficient but unfriendly i would happily give them  stars if they ever cracked a smile for now a  star rating is just right,Positive
328-katong-laksa,there is only one variety of laksa here and its great fast service cheap and delicious i ordered the large in hindsight a small would have done the coconut broth is subtle and spicy small chunks of seafood throughout a bowl full of noodles if you are looking for good value for money laksa look no further,Positive
328-katong-laksa,every time i am back in town to visit the family it is a food fest there is no way around it and my first meal of the trip in particular holds a special place for me this trip it was katong laksa first things first do not ask for chopsticks the noodles are cut down to size so that they easily fit on your spoon so that with each spoonful you get an effortless and amazing mixture of soup noodles shrimp fish cake and cockles if you are not a fan of the heat not to worry this location is indoors and air conditioned sheltering you from the heat humidity and often times rain speaking of heat the soup itself is not too spicy but definitely grab a little pack of sambal to spice things up perfect dish to stir up all that nostalgia i cannot wait for my next trip to get more,Positive
328-katong-laksa,if you are in the mood for laksa come here recommended came here for a late lunch of laksa with a side order of otah grilled fish cake the place was crowded but i was still able to get an inside table food the laksa comes in small and large even the small was a good quantity of delicious laksa including noodles prawns and otah the gravy is very flavorful spicy but you can add extra chili if you want to kick it up a notch the otah is tasty and not spicy cost good value the small laksa was s   and the otah was s   very reasonable considering the amounts service they were very efficient and the order came out quickly atmosphere this place is a typical small shop house in katong the indoor seating is a bit cramped and consists of little plastic stools with no backs one wall is full of historical photos of the shop and the owner overall come here for the laksa not the ambiance but do give it a try,Positive
328-katong-laksa,not very delicious just the usual run of the mill laksa portion is very small trying to be elitist but not quite making it,Negative
328-katong-laksa,i have been wanting laksa for the past week and we finally got to eat at a laksa shop the shop itself is rather small but could house up to   guests my husband order the  small bowls of the laksa he also ordered lime juice for himself and luohan longan for me my mother in law was also with us but she prefered something warm but the shop does not offer anything warm so she did not want a drink the order comes right out once he places his order and he brought all the laksa and drinks on a tray to our table the laksa only comes with a spoon there is no forks or chopsticks at this shop i wanted a pair of chopsticks or fork because my noodles were quite long and each time i scoop up the noodles and toppings all of the noodles would slide right off and only the toppings were left eventually i managed to look for the shorter noodles in my bowl and enjoyed those first which was pretty good because there were slices of squid cuttlefish there were also small clam like things in the laksa as well i was not a fan of those and scoop most of them out for my husband since he enjoys eating them it is a good thing we occasionally like different things because i could eat what he does not like and he can eat what i do not like this shop only sells a couple of items on the menu and the main dish would of course be laksa it would have been nice if there is more variety to laksa like the toppings or more different seasoning i do like how they posted pictures of celebrities and famous people on the wall that had visited the shop back in the days i could recognize some of the celebrities and it is nice to know they had been here one time long ago,Positive
328-katong-laksa,great laksa in a modest setting variations are either small or large bowl had a small for   sgd which was enough for a light dinner good balance between curry coconut seafood flavors with a touch of heat did not add the included packet of samba chili sauce because the flavor profile was already so enjoyable i did not want to change the balance,Positive
328-katong-laksa,fresh we took the laksa full of taste spicy in a good way good portion also the lime juice is nice,Positive
328-katong-laksa,do we love laksa if it is not an asam laska for sure and this place has it all seafood coconut lime spice yummmm menu is simple laksa fish and rice small for  and large for  not bad at all and its self serve so serve yourself dcor you are in an open area cafeteria style place food great drinks plenty they have thai ice tea coconut drinks lime drinks and so on laksa creamy milk delicious laksa i love the shrimps and fish slices as well as all the fixins they add on top the noodles are exactly what i like almost like that tapioca noodle perfect to soak up all the soup and stay al dente opak opak fish in pandan leave aka the banana leaves it is nice and flaky also their nasi lemak is also a good option if you want more crunch and flavors with your meal everything is reasonably priced taste good their hot sauce is out of this world the only complaint i have is that they chop their noodles up like why i mean i know why i guess they do it so that everyone can enjoy this soup with on spoon instead of using a spoon a fork and some chopsticks faster way to eat your noodles i would prefer having to fight roll and twirl my noodles in whatever i am eating minus that it is still pretty good you can sit indoor or outdoor take a picture with that massive wall of celebs pics and enjoy your laksa yummm,Positive
328-katong-laksa,i was told that this place has the best laksa by at least four locals so i was determined to try it btw laksa is a traditional singaporean curry noodle dish i had opted to go at night as the morning heat was too much to have curry upon arriving i had instantly noticed the wall of celebrities that have patronized the establishment i ordered the small laksa and it was ready right away i noticed that the three shrimps in the bowl was quite small and nothing like the picture i proceeded to try it and sadly it was nothing special to me half way through i added a packet of their chili sauce and this gave it a much needed kick i do not mean extra spiciness but complexity before the chili sauce it was a very boring bowl of noodles so thank goodness for that chili sauce i liked the sauce so much that i bought a jar to take away,Negative
328-katong-laksa,visited this place a couple of times the laksa is good so is the nasi lemak plenty of place to seat inside or outside it can be congested during weekends especially during dinner time,Positive
328-katong-laksa,the local laksa is the famous and delicious from this restaurants good taste with very nice smell of coconut milk combination in the spicy soup good to try,Positive
328-katong-laksa,we went out of our way to go to  katong laksa and we were glad we did this is the best laksa but be careful it is spicy,Positive
328-katong-laksa,when i told my singapore friend how much i love laksa this was the one place he told me i had to try so one day i hopped on the bus and went  katong laksa is a small self serve restaurant you order at the counter and then grab a seat at an open table there is indoor and outdoor seating there was not many people when i went maybe because it was during off peak hours i think it will be more crowded during the lunch dinner time frame i do recommend sitting indoors because there is a c and trust me you will be sweating when eating that bowl of laksa their menu consists of laksa small or large bowl for   nasi lemak   a packet and otah   each i tried the laksa and the otah i personally think the small bowl of laksa is just enough note that you cannot alter the bowl of noodles at all nor omit any ingredients it comes just the way it is it was a little bland for me so make sure to add a packet of the sauce that comes with the bowl of noodles from what i remember it comes with  packets but charge per packet after that it definitely adds more flavor to the broth i have to warn those that cannot take the heat because it is spicy also expect to eat this with a soup spoon no chopsticks fork the otah a type of fish cake was real good especially if you add some of that sauce that came with your laksa after pondering long and hard the laksa was actually really good and is one of the better bowls i have had in singapore but i do not think i would take a   min bus ride all the way out here to satisfy my laksa craving,Positive
328-katong-laksa,apparently the chain of choice for this dish i have never tried and was delicious highlights laksa their claim to fame was a smooth coconutty limey and spicy broth combo noodles were slippery short almost bean sprouty which was different   stars opak opak minced white fish cooked in banana leaves worried it would be overly fishy but was not   starslowlights just laksa nasi lasek and opak opak so have people who want other items go elsewhere and meet you after outdoor version so can get hot compared to the ac options inside glad i discovered another dish i would eat again,Negative
328-katong-laksa,small place well known since gordon ramsay went there during one of his shows it was just across our hotel my husband found out about it while walking the street he tried the famous laksa that he really enjoyed we went back together the following day definitely a must do in singapore very tasty a bit hot they even give you extra sauce but we did not need it a winner,Positive
328-katong-laksa,delicious laksa but do not ask or look for chopsticks cos you are not suppose to eat it with chopsticks only a soup spoon to get the full flavor of the spices in the soup must be a baba cook in the kitchen,Negative
328-katong-laksa,did not quite do it for me texture of the noodle was so so the flavor of the broth was good but nothing that would make me jump out of my seat or burst into songs think there is a bit of hype here,Negative
328-katong-laksa,definitely one of the best laksa in singapore sgd  for small bowl and sgd  for big so tasty and full of seafood in soup however i should not put a chili which covered the flavor otah is made by fish and coconut rice is dried maybe next time should try those steamed many people come because of its reputation western and eastern,Positive
328-katong-laksa,surprisingly fantastic laksa in katong one of a couple famous places serving this dish i have eaten laksa less times than the fingers on one hand but this was delicious the coconut milk mellowed the savoury base into this rounded creamy soup with an unexpected lightness and the tender noodles were slippery bits that worked its way between the fresh prawns and cockles i certainly did not expect to enjoy it nearly this much and the just on the edge sour of the lime juice was pretty perfect the small coffeeshop space is fully air conditioned which is fantastic considering the heat and spiciness of the dish but that luxury does reflect itself in its price little matter though as it honestly is more filling than whatever you would receive at a newfangled cafe for the money and is likely executed with more skill and finesse anyway worth a visit and definitely worth the money,Positive
328-katong-laksa,i came here a few times to enjoy the spicy laska which is supposed to be the better ones over here there are a few branches of this in singapore and from what i heard this is the best you can choose to sit either indoors or outdoors of course with singapore is kind of weather indoors is the only option for me enjoying the hot bowl of laska with a cold drink of barley is definitely satisfying for me i often choose the  bowl which is enough to satisfying my hunger the noodles in the laska is sliced to small pieces which means a pair of chopsticks is not required and you can just enjoy with a spoon it is has a strong flavour and every spoonful of it makes me want more that is how i felt especially on my last trip there for foreigners you should come by to try at least once get the feel of enjoying one of singapore is popular dishes overall i find this to be my liking and definitely give my thumbs up to those thinking of trying,Positive
328-katong-laksa,wowza pretty amazing laksa note however its all seafood so if you are vegetarian or dont eat seafood then unfortunately you are all out of luck i enjoyed the complexity of the laksa curry sauce too spicy sour tangy and fishy all in one noodles and seafood also in just the right amount its not a full on  stars because i have had better laksa but the otah gets a full  stars i have never had it before and its basically fish in a banana leaf but omg the flavors bursting with umami goodness robust and complex the smell reminded me of earthy mushrooms and black tea with a dash of soy taste wise not sure how to describe the otah a little bit spongy soft but not melting like jelly my description does not do the otah justice so just trust me on this and try some will def recommend,Positive
328-katong-laksa,the laksa is so tasty they do not provide chopsticks so you eat with just a spoon as the noodle is cut it is not a bad idea as you just eat more of the soup with it otah was nice place is very clean,Positive
328-katong-laksa,the soup is delicious with seafood taste the otah and coconut rice is fine people say it is the best laksa in singapore it is a little far away from downtown if you have time to take a look in this area you can come and have a try,Positive
328-katong-laksa,so yummy i tried the laksa naturally and loved it not too fishy and rich coconut broth very satisfying the nasi lemak and otah were fun to eat on the side would definitely recommend as a lunch spot,Positive
328-katong-laksa,my mother raved great things about laksa so we decided to check out  katong laksa my father mentioned that this place is one of the top rated places on trip advisor we took a cab to come here since it is in the outer part of downtown singapore for myself i got the small laksa bowl it is pretty much chopped up noodles in a coconut milk spicy broth they put shrimp and clams inside the broth they also provide you with  chili packets up to  max they charge you additional for more which enhances the flavor of the laksa i recommend you use it overall experience i enjoyed it it is full of flavor do not think i can eat this too often though must try it once when you are in singapore though,Positive
328-katong-laksa,an old singapore brand and listed in the michelin guide it is still served with hum and just a spoon although it would have been even more nostalgic served in the porcelain bowls of old the laksa gravy is not as rich and thick as i remember but still flavourful,Negative
328-katong-laksa,i love this  katong laksa is location this might not be the original location but for me as long as i can have a great food and good services i am happy and with ac too the lone waiter here is nice patient and friendly answered all our questions and gave us good recommendations with a big smile and of course the only reason here is for the laksa and that is the only thing offers in the menu with the only decision to made is the sizes when i want to ask for a pair of chopsticks my yelp friend realized i did not read up on katong laksa before my trip as katong laksa is a variant of laksa lemak from the katong area of singapore in katong laksa the noodles are normally cut up into smaller pieces so that the entire dish can be eaten with a spoon alone without chopsticks or a fork it is one of the most enjoyable laksa i have the soup base is so rich with coconut and the hot sauce on the side just add the heat to the noodle itself and eating with a spoon is just awesome as i probably have problem trying to pick up the slippery noodle with my chopsticks anyway silent while we enjoying our laksa i will be happy to have one of this for lunch everyday source from wikipedia,Positive
328-katong-laksa,had small laksa and tiger beer spicy and delicious stop at this place each trip the fish and chili crab dumpling were good as well,Positive
328-katong-laksa,first try for katong laksa had heard of how delicious katong laksa is since long ago now finally have the chance to try out okay so the laksa is not bad well i eat laksa must be spicy but this katong laksa is not spicy to me at all so for those who does not really eat spicy this laksa should be good saw many famous overseas actors actresses came to have laksa here many years ago because in the photos they are at their younger looks the queue in line is long but still can be wait it also sells tissue at   per tissue pack and beverages too overall i think is okay but venue is too far for me to come back anytime,Negative
328-katong-laksa,the seafood in laksa is a lit bit fishy otah and the rice are fine overall,Positive
328-katong-laksa,as an american expat that lived in singapore i tried laksa a few times i thought  was the best the fact that i stayed at dunman road just  minutes walk from there did not hurt get the cockles cannot wait to return to singapore and indulge in some more of  is ooey gooey goodness,Negative
328-katong-laksa,this was our first meal in singapore it is at the corner of ceylon and east coast road the place happily promotes that it has ac guess it would help out on those hot tropical days look for all the pictures of the owner s and random celebrities if you have an issue with milk or coconut milk then this place may be your new arch nemesis your bowels will not be pleased if you decide to consume this our waiter gave us a whopping  seconds before asking what we wanted i guess there is only laksa available because he asked us which size small medium large we went for the medium and the amerrrrrrican in me felt like i should have asked for xl he then asked if we are okay with shrimp and if we wanted the clam the shrimp was fine but the clams are quite fishy if you are not ready for a taste of the ocean sea life do not ask for the clams he also murmured some other appetizer which we said sure to it ended up being this baked curry paste thing wrapped in a banana leaf pardon my ignorance if i cannot recall the name of it or what it is exactly made of damn tourist at least we gave it a shot and it was just aiight next a random old man came up to us and asked us for drinks do not freak out if he asks you to pay on the spot he is working out of some other stall that does not belong to  katong laksa get the barley drink it is supposedly a singaporean favorite and out of all the ones i have tried during my time in sg this was probably one of the better ones it is a great counter to intake with your laksa noodle soup the laksa comes out quick and the presentation looks simple yet the smell will make you want to dive right in all you are given is a spoon they say they cut the white thin round noodles enough where you can just spoon it out i took it upon myself and grabbed some chopsticks elsewhere at broke tradition please do not punish me for it i do not know any better the coconut curry soup base is rich and should be attacked immediately when it lands on your table while it is still steaming out of the pot i would recommend you adding some of that chili paste to give it a kick it is really not spicy at all actually the thai in me wishes there was vinegar or lime wedges to go with the soup but i was not trying to be that picky i think i killed the bowl within a few minutes i am still trying to distinguish if i was just hungry or if that bowl of noodles was just that legit i am going to say both this place is probably known to the world as the joint chef gordon ramsay stopped at i guess that is why she chose it and i am glad we checked it out because it was another enjoyable meal it is a quick bite in a simplistic setting i am not surprised if it is cash only we were lucky to stop by when it was not packed and i did notice other tourists meddling around i am now a fan of this curry laksa noodle stuff,Negative
328-katong-laksa,they used to be good since their renovation i can only say this if you are going to renovate raise prices ensure that your portions and quality of food remains or at least improve not many places to find decent laksa today might have lead to many of the good reviews but frankly they used to be much better they used to care more and well from someone who have lived right next to the store for years you could taste it too otah is otah hard to go wrong but the laksa soup broth curry was poor the ingredients overall were poor flavour was boring and so on and for those prices no no no,Negative
328-katong-laksa,my first experience with laksa and it is tasty the bowl of noodles with coconut based spicy broth had a very nice flavor and bite i can see how one can get addicted or develop a love for it like jook or ramen nice little joint w ac and serving the famous singapore lime juice,Positive
328-katong-laksa,above all else singapore is known for its insanely good diverse and thriving food culture it should carry some weight then when i say that after three extensive trips to the country each with a top priority and extensive research of dining that this is the best dish i have had to add further merit i should mention that i am allergic to shrimp prawn and yet i still seek this place out multiple times during my limited stays braving the hives and puffy eyed ness because it is seriously that good be sure to pair the dish with some white barley juice bah lee and get the leaf wrapped fish cake most locals seem to enjoy adding clams to the main dish but it is a bit too strong on the ocean notes for my liking,Positive
328-katong-laksa,if bourdain liked it then it is good enough for me so we tried  katong laksa on east coast road in singapore especially since our hotel was across the street this place has a reputation for making the best malaysian laksa around it was and just the way singaporeans love their food spicy hot portions at street hawker prices grab an ice cold lime juice to cool off all that hotness the space was small and although they said they had aircon it was a bit humid inside on the day we visited there were at least  photos plastered on the walls of celebrities who have slurped in these seats including anthony bourdain but things may have changed since he is dined here as i said before the laksa was good with lots of noodles cockles and prawns floating in a spicy chili and coconut broth but the servers were mostly unresponsive think soup nazi asian style but not just one many i will also throw in here that most singaporeans i have met or know as friends are warm and friendly including the people working in the service industry most will smile and hand you back your singaporean dollars with both hands something so simple and polite yet you do not see that exchange happening much in the states i would have given them  stars if i were only rating on the laksa but management clearly needed to offer the staff some emily post classes,Positive
328-katong-laksa,lovely laksa although i prefer mine a little spicier really good balance of flavours and i have never had otah before i wish we could get otah in sydney highly recommend this place for a beautiful filling meal with bags of flavour,Positive
328-katong-laksa,this place seems to always have a full house but the queue moves pretty quick since there are only a few options on the menu to choose from and they are quick to serve you order by the front door before you get a table so i recommend you get some otah to start because you get that immediately and can snack on that while you wait for your hot bowls of laksa the laksa comes in  sizes and the small plus otah was a good portion for me i was not super hungry though so can probably go for the next size up if i queued for any longer this curry based broth was delicious but what is unique is it is a bowl of short noodles eaten with a spoon although tasty i have a preference for long noodles which is probably why i personally rate it slightly lower oh you can also tailor your order i am not a huge fan of cockles to be honest so requested none of those,Positive
328-katong-laksa,best laksa i have ever had spicy put ota on top get the lemon juice guy at the cashier could be a bit more inviting though smile it is free,Positive
328-katong-laksa,the heat in this famous traditional singaporean dish is simply perfect eating noodles with only a spoon allows you to capture all the elements of the wonderful spices combined and giving a delightful mouthful experience loved this place for years and will probably continue to do,Positive
328-katong-laksa,nice laksa quick service and efficient easy and nothing fancy hawker food otah is very nice nasi lemak nice,Positive
328-katong-laksa,i was told here to come here by a friend who grew up in singapore and if you are looking for laksa this is the place to go with two options large or small you know they must be on to something the food was delicious and affordable and clearly a popular spot for locals and tourists alike i also opted for the lime juice but found this to be a bit too sweet,Positive
328-katong-laksa,this is by far the best laksa i have had in my entire life i used to have katong laksa at queensway shopping centre while i was in secondary school but only years later did i come here to have the katong laksa at katong itself the additional sambal belachan they have goes very well with the laksa i love the concept of how you can choose the size of the bowls and you can also additionally order otah otah with your laksa this place has a cosy air conditioned indoors and also a small outdoor area so you can choose wherever you want to sit,Positive
328-katong-laksa,i have visited singapore  times when my boyfriend was studying there while he is at school i would explore the area singapore is quite small looking for some fun food to eat i first came to know laksa and loooooooved it when i studied in sydney australia but i had to try it singapore where it came from this place tho maybe i was hungry after walking so much looking for this place maybe there was something in that humid singapore air whoa literally blew my mind the best laksa ever and it is cheap,Positive
328-katong-laksa,sgd   will get you a small and filling bowl of laksa consisting of spicy seafood and coconut broth cut mee hoon rice vermicelli shrimp mussels clams and sliced fish cake beware it is quite spicy tip make sure you get the lime juice too and do not ask for chopsticks you eat with a spoon fast service highly recommend,Positive
328-katong-laksa,love this place if you are in singapore you have to try laksa the laksa is so amazing it is a perfect bowl of thick rice noodles in a creamy seafood stock and lots of spices the prepared chili paste adds great flavors to the soup the herb a vietnamese cilantro is also a signature of this dish its unique flavor is wonderful,Positive
328-katong-laksa,katong is known for it is laksa i ended up going to this cute little joint after a long day hanging out and doing unfinished business my family friends from church told me that i should go to this place on the east side and it was delicious no one can make southeast asian in this condition i have always wanted to try laksa and not bad for a head start it has beaten how i make it at home the only problem is not that bad but there was no boost in flavor other than that it was really worth my singapore dollars,Negative
328-katong-laksa,singaporean laksa is different from the malaysian kind much more lemak and noodles and typically the rice noodles instead of the egg noodles that being said i think that the  katong laksa is really good with a good curry broth they do not have much selection of anything else so laksa is pretty much all you are going to get,Positive
328-katong-laksa,creamy awesomeness in a bowl if you are in the area and craving some laksa head here and you wo not be disappointed,Positive
328-katong-laksa,bus da leeeeps incredible wonder in a beautifully ancient building combined with a chilled tiger beer you will be set,Positive
328-katong-laksa,the best laksa period the broth is so flavorful and deep and creamy make sure to add the chilli as it really imparts some additional depth of flavor to the dish,Positive
328-katong-laksa,i supposed this has become a tourist attraction and gone are the days where cheap and good can go hand in hand was there only today and the guy said no cockles ok how can say not ok when you walked all the way there for a fix so i said can discount ok the guy stared at me and was about to tell me no soup for you now go luckily i quickly said i was joking but he were not too please anyway chili is now in one small packet and there goes the other kick so this is a real turn off given the price the service the chili etc so looks like will have to head to tangs food court for my fix going forward,Positive
328-katong-laksa,spicy seafood soup that is loaded with seafood be prepared to eat everything with a spoon and do not bother asking for a fork or chopsticks soup has a very similar taste to thai dishes but hotter,Negative
328-katong-laksa,first time for katong laksa we went there before noon on weekday with only a few people sitting inside we did not wait at all so far the best laksa ever deftly will go back again,Positive
328-katong-laksa,i had no idea what laksa was but after reading some good yelp reviews decided to check this place out as it is near the hotel and open on a weekday morning absolutely loved it savoury cocunutty broth with just enough spice to wake you up and little noodles perfect for eating with just a spoon add in some seafood in the form of various fish cakes and you have got yourself a winner a must try for even the most confused tourist,Positive
328-katong-laksa,not great overrated i have had better elsewhere coconut soup had sour taste this was around  pm so soup was probably turning bad it was a takeaway so i could not return it,Negative
328-katong-laksa,delicious laksa i highly recommend this if you do not like spicy like me you do not have to add more hot sauce that comes in a sachet,Positive
328-katong-laksa,the whole island comes here during weekends place is crowded but always worth the wait this is simply the best laksa you can find on this little red dot highly recommended,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,this is not just a third wave coffee house but it is also a proper dining establishment not only did i enjoy a rich bold ethiopian slow brew but i also enjoyed the common man full breakfast it looked a tad pricey from the menu but the plate itself did not disappoint it came with two free range organic eggs a large serving of bacon plenty of sausage a good amount of tomatoes an entire portobello mushroom a serving of chorizo baked beans as well as a large slab of toast while the coffee and the food might take a while to prepare staff members are friendly and engaging and the contemporary light filled venue hosts a mostly expat crowd there is a variety of seating for groups large and small whether at tables or at communal benches perfect for conversation reading or even some laptop work a nice find,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,common man coffee roasters serves outstanding coffee paired with fresh food be forewarned that the restaurant is often packed the wait can be long up to  minutes in addition the prices are on the higher end but the ingredients and food quality are superb the flavor concoction makes the long wait and high price worth it the coffee is just amazing they have several varieties of coffee options all freshly brewed you can also buy their roasted beans to bring home to brew yourself drink some coffee eat good food and relax,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,to my surprise i chowed down on a lot of different breakfast breads while in singapore be they pancakes or french toast and while the pancakes at common man were not quite up to the bar set by clinton street they were very good star  how were the service and atmosphere common man really knocks it out of the park when it comes to both their service and atmosphere you have got a big open space that does not get too packed even during peak days and times and it is comfortable enough to either relax with a group or get some work done our dishes came out quickly upon being ordered star star  how were the portions relative to the cost   for pancakes is well it is expensive and was actually even more expensive than high brow foreigner clinton street baking company for a comparable portion even so this is roughly what you expect from a high end breakfast spot in singapore star stars  and  how was the food these were very good pancakes were they the fluffy symphony that you can find at clinton street no but they had good texture good taste and some great peripherals in the nuts berry sauce and bananas presentation was top notch as well two stars star  would you be excited to go back it is only the fact that clinton street exists that i cannot give a fifth star here no star,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,i was looking for an early morning breakfast place to help me deal with the jet lag when i first saw common man coffee roasters and read all the good comments they had they also have a yoga place upstairs where you can take classes so if you are an early bird or suffering from jet lag you can start the day with some yoga and come downstairs for a great breakfast i went with the eggs benedict and fast brew coffee eggs come with ox meat and they are delicious coffee is pretty good too they do breakfast and lunch and have some good looking desserts all in all this is a great place that i would absolutely recommend one small caveat though it seems to be a favorite for expats so if you are looking for some place where locals eat i do not know if common man should be your go to but hey you wont regret coming here,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,i was quite impressed by the variety on the menu eggs in all different kinds and flavours to start with i just stuck to that my kale and scrambled eggs was super yummy and heartier than i expected it to be the house filter coffee to top this off with was excellent creamy and full of zing i would definitely go back there for more but the prices are on the high side for sure makes the coming back a little harder it was superr crowded for a sunday lunch too the communal tables are not the best bet if you are meeting friends it is hard to talk over the ambient chatter to someone sitting  people away,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,normally come here for the coffee and brunch food however ordered a takeaway latte today and after waiting for  minutes i enquired about my order they could not find my order but apologised for it i really like their blends but  minutes is way too long to wait for a to go latte,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,first time here the baristas were obviously not experienced or were swamped one cappuccino was over extracted and one under just was not pleasant the bean selection was in an awkward location where seated patrons were getting frustrated with potential buyers looking at roast dates lol it is a tight busy spot food was not bad a bit on the pricey end but the quality of the ingredients was good,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,needed a normal breakfast as i have been traveling through asia for quite some time found this place with good reviews gave it a try it was so good that i went two days in a row queue was not bad at all but i was rolling solo so if you have a group it might be different i love the space and the communal tables very inviting and casual which is always a plus to me service is fine considering how busy they were their uncommon coffee was unbelievably good and i highly recommend it i was blown away by the flavors of the coffee bean and tried to buy some to take back but unfortunately they were sold out next time first day i was here i ordered the pancakes with a berry compote and walnuts great texture and a mix of sweet and salty pretty filling for two thick pieces if you love sweet breakfasts that is definitely worth a try second day i got the common man breakfast with poached eggs everything was fresh and it all married well together huge portions but not heavy which i liked if i lived in the area this would be my go to reminds me of brunch here in san francisco getting together with friends over good food and chatting away loved it,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,lovely long blacks complement the great homemade granola filled big bowl of fresh fruit granola and yoghurt even for a hungry breakfasteer a big job to finish eating the whole bowl loved it nice crew serving the food,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,coffee in singapore does not get better than the one served here great service and consistently delicious food it is my go to place,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,came here based on the positive reviews and based on how busy it was it is obviously a popular location the staff was very friendly and helpful but i was shocked at the prices for what was provided s  purchased me a tiny take away latte with an okay pulled shot of espresso i forgot to order a croissant so i went back and ordered one which also shocked me at s  like the espresso the croissant was nothing to write home about overall for a few dollars less this would have been a  star review,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,not impressed a bit overhypped the coffee was weak the fluffy pancakes were dense inside the vegetable rosti is not really a rosti maybe i was just unlucky but for my first experience the food did not impress me the service was great though,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,i had the eggs benedict was quite unique with the braised ox cheek loved it also had fresh squeezed orange juice and their cappuccino only knock on the place was the service they forgot about us a few times and double ordered some items could be improved but food was yummy,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,if you are yelping from singapore you are probably american and pretty basic luckily so am i and this place is effing delicious do yourself a favor and order the turkish breakfast but then please get some laksa later you are in singapore,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,brunch here on a sunday morning good was solid but incredibly disappointed with poor service after waiving down  servers to see if my wife is food was coming and being promised that it was our original server came back and said she never even placed the order when i spoke to the manager about this she said she was not even aware that we had been waiting for half an hour not sure we would come back,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,stayed at a nearby hotel and went twice to this little gem for breakfast they have amazing coffee and the menu is delicious the turkish common man is a really great vegetarian option the house baked cornbread is like a avocado toast on steroids and brioche french toast is huge great service and great atmosphere,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,i end up in this place with my husband after making so research on google for best breakfast in singapore the place is amazing for breakfast they have everything you need from diet food with white omelette to fatty breakfast with bacon for my part it was fatty breakfast they also have delicious and original fruits juice like carrots orange and mint or celery sounds weird but i can assure you that the  juices that i tried were amazing the service is fast efficient and friendly i definitely recommend this little place,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,i have been obsessed with places like this for such a long time now is that kind of place that you really feel to work out before coming having your breakfast coffee juice or lunch and you will feel healthy after being there i went there together with my mom before walking around in singapore actually we went there  times first time was before walking around in the city we had two salad and one green kale juice second time i went for the egg benedict it came with some kind of meat which i have never tried before and my mom was having a granola of course we both went for a cappuccino great place to come before work out i will before walking long because you know you will get some good ingredients and healthy food and also is so,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,this is a big hit with the yoga crowd coming down from yoga movement but it is not a big hit to the taste buds super average food delivered way under expectations menu plays the health card well but make sure you avoid the baked eggs and quinoa salad not tasty by any measure eggs were dry like the gobi it draws a nice crowd but that is about it the drink menu only has three juices clocking in at  a pop and is just about the same size as a double espresso if you are looking to check out the yoga bods creep on over here if you are more interested in a good brunch mosey down to supermkt at rob quay,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,we left the uk last year and have not had an english breakfast since nor have we had real bacon or sausages so this was amazing probably one of the best full breakfasts we have ever had anywhere i will certainly be back well done,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,great breakfast and ambience great selections the service was also good might have to wait for tables during peak hours but well worth it i had kale with white scrambled eggs which was delicious balance of taste in every bite,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,pricey but delicious we were here on our first day on our vacation it was by far the most we spent on breakfast our week long stay by at least   i believe our total came to about  for coffees and the meal that being said the food was great my husband had a benedict and i had the kale and egg whites seriously delish healthy and tasty what could be better,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,comman man coffee but uncommon service and food fortunately we came early on sunday morning had the pancake toast and croissant full marks of taste presentation and of course service be back for sure,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,a rather nice coffee shop that being  block back the the river is a little quieter and hence more relaxed and enjoyable i ordered the eggs on pea fritters with rocket salad which was really great if filling and both a short macchiato and a flat white both perfectly robust and enjoyable plus a green juice which was tasty,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,my friend took me here after we went to the sea aquarium i will just review the drinks here i guess the coffee latte art was really pretty i still remember how they made the latte in front of you i guess i was kinda new to latte art at that time besides i remember the barista making pour over in the back of the counter love the whole atmosphere of this place too,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,great food disappointing coffee the good stuff portions of food are tasty large plenty for vegetarians free wifi adorable sugar canisters the space is large and attractive lookingthe not so good stuff i found the coffee really bitter and while i appreciate that they brought me hot milk for my latte when i requested extra milk i was still overwhelmed with a bitter taste and left half my latte behind the stools are pretty uncomfortable probably by design so you do not linger too long food prices felt a little high  sgd for the veggie breakfast,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,the veggie wonderland was delicious i adore grilled haloumi i am very happy to have found a healthy breakfast spot in my hood but regardless of how popular a restaurant is you should never have to wait  minutes for food they should reconsider how many covers they can serve at once without hurting the diners overall impression,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,excellent service and food nice environment and vibe young well trained staff the place runs like a clock watch everyone is focused on doing kudos to the manager,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,one of the places i visit every time i am in singapore and i was a bit surprised to find that i had forgotten to review it they are located a few blocks from the water at robertson quay and it actually means that it feels much calmer despite this place always being popular they focus is of course on the coffee as they are a roaster and i often sample several of the different beans that they offer as filter coffees one of the reasons i find myself a repeat visitor is that they are really good at rotating the selection and there are always at least four different single origins to select from they are all nicely prepared and while i may not always like all of them the quality is consistently very good the espresso based beverages are also very good but as i always say rather have a good filter coffee the service is always friendly and even when sitting a bit hidden outside they ensure to check on you at regular intervals which is not always the case at other places they also serve very good food and pastries my main objection here is not the quality as everything i had here as been good but rather that the prices are a bit steep i do not really feel that i am getting value for money here but it is still not that bad as to stop me from coming here i do however mainly come for the coffee and often do not even order any food they also do hold some workshops and coffee training sessions so the commitment to coffee is really clear all in all one of the better coffee places in singapore and well worth a visit,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,i liked the decor but it was on the noisy side it was packed but we only waited for about  minutes around  am on a sunday the queue was a bit longer when we left around  the running theme with the dishes seemed to be that everything was dry unfortunately the service was quick veggie wonderland   starssauce please or get your eggs soft boiled pancakes    starsgood flavor but very dry and not many ingredients to go along with it i had to ask for butter to go along with it but it would probably have been better with yogurt or some sort of compote eggs benedict  tried a bit of this the eggs were excellent the ox cheek was a little chewy soy latte   starsno extra charge for soy there are two shots in one glass and no decaf option just a heads up the carpark right next door under off arnasalam chetty road was expensive  hour on weekends and small tight corners,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,i went there twice and not impressed neither the coffee nor the ambience tables are too close to each other you cannot really enjoy the food coffee is weak too,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,i am here so much it is a wonder i have not reviewed yet coffee i was never a huge fan of the flavour of their house blend but it is not for lack of freshness or lack of skill in the barista i have had it several times and i get a bit tired of it but it is a consistently respectable cup it is kinda dark and heavy and bold and seems more so than any of the house blends of the many rd wave coffee places i frequent i enjoy the brighter fruitier flavours with a bit more subtlety regardless it is a decent cup consistently served the steaming technique is good here so you get velvety layers in your flat whites and lattes etc happily and recently i found out that for no extra charge you can request one of the other beans in the other grinders usually there are  others on tap i have had a single origin tanzania and lucky bastard which they recommend for flat whites and enjoyed both i also tried a single origin india one this week and it was good yay as this coffee joint is a really convenient location for me food they have really yummy bread here my family and friends have remarked on this several times i like the pepita softer with some texture from nuts and the sourdough crusty and chewier crust i enjoy that with an order of avocado you get half sprinkled with chilli flakes and served with lemon the pancakes also are unusually fluffy moist and tasty like they have been made with brown sugar the scrambled eggs here are perfectly done if you like the fluffy texture type with a touch of creaminess free range eggs used and the serving size is good a range of big mixed plates available i have tried the vegetarian one with haloumi cheese and the one with the beef cheeks both were good if a touch greasy when i do not feel like having coffee the fresh kale mixed with apple and mint juice is very popular and tastes good while making you feel virtuous service is all smiles friendly and professional i heard from the staff that they are going to change the menu soon i do think it is about time although please keep the bread avocado and add some scones they also sell beans and coffee stuff it is styled after melbourne coffee places and that is not surprising since the co owner hails from there,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,this is a high level espresso the lemon cheesecake is ok at  bucks a bit overpriced but the espresso is top for sure edit actually i think after tasting a bunch of my fav recently this is the best espresso in sg as of now imo of course,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,hmmm this place has lots of potential it is got a large enough space so it does not feel cramped the wait staff are suitable friendly and perky and personable yay the vibe is too cool for school trendy hip then why does it feel like something is off the prices the food is overpriced for what i am paying it should be better than its competitors who are selling the same things for less the pancakes were nice not wow the organic eggs benedict with ox cheeks were nice but at sgd it is not worth so much i would pay less the croissant croque monsieur or was it madame was dry and of course not cheap either i am overpaying for food that does not wow the food does not suck but it is not outstanding at those prices therein lies the crux of this place are you willing to pay sgd for a brunch item with average coffee if you just want the ambience then by all means real foodies would not visit this place often just sayin,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,unlike chss and nylon common man roasters patron base is made up of an unusually large number of westerners akin to dining at pf changs in the states the expat crowd is decidedly cbd in neck knot style and a far cry from the hipster look that so many other reviewers comment on i prefer the more local atmosphere at chye seng huat hardware chss where there is a livelier vibe and coffee aficionados are actually speaking with one another rather than having their heads buried in a mobile device a large dining room welcomes guests to a full breakfast and lunch menu complete with creative and delicious dishes as well as wonderfully prepared coffee drinks bonus points for the french glassware in which lattes are served i had purchased these very same glasses at merci in paris last november,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,love this place super pricey but some things are extremely worth it my husband and i ordered the veggie wonderland swoon and my husband was happily surprised at how full he could get without eating meat i also ordered their uncommon man coffee which i picked off the menu amazing,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,a good brunch place with a very hipsterish vibe reminded me strongly of portland they take their coffee seriously and have some splendid brews which rotate regularly definitely taste as many as u can brunch menu is good as well huge portions so come with an appetite,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,it is interesting how there are both lovers and haters of this place i am a lover for sure there is always a line during peak hours but it is totally worth it we had the veggie wonderland and turkish common man as well as flat whites for coffee everything was as delicious as it looked the ambiance and service were great and i will be back again and again,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,great coffee and exquisite breakfast we stopped in singapore on a layover to thailand found this place on yelp i am so glad i did this is a must try for coffee,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,fans of  hands are bound to be fans of this place why same atmosphere and food well not exactly the same food but the same normal type of breakfast they were rather strict on the lunch menu starts at   pm rule why my gf and i came at   and i was not very interested in the breakfast options i did not want eggs or toast i was not in the mood to pop out  for fruit either at the end i settled for the turkish commonman but was not too impressed overall this is not a bad place the hippest joint at the moment but i do not foresee it being so much longer the coffee was not good too sour and acidic sum go once and do not come back,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,hype they are really lazy here food came out cold presumably pre cooked even a denny is wo not do that soggy bacon and pink undercooked sausage looks over substance mediocre coffee pleasant service expensive better places within walking distance edit i gave a  star at first but changing it to a  because when we asked them to heat up the sausage their first answer was that is how it is supposed to be here no smh,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,delicious coffee and fresh quality meals but be prepared to queue up if you come during peak periods due to its open concept layout and tiled surfaces this venue can become quite noisy when many patrons are present not ideal for working on your laptop perhaps bring headphones if you plan to get anything done,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,what a space the wow effect hits you even before you enter if you grew up in a neighbourhood with white lions outside the house then this is nothing new it is quite the same it has two huge birds placed by the entrance the bar is spectacularly decorated with aeropress drip filters and a dark horse like synesso everyone is sleek and well mannered the staffs are extremely friendly and take the initiative to understand you and your dining experience spa esprit persona score food is very flavourful fresh and delicious a friend and i came here for lunch our food came quickly but it was served separately so we had to wait for each other is food to arrive both of us ordered salads which were very refreshing coffee is good but i cannot help to admit the ceramic cups are not meant for coffee drinkers like me it is most preferredwith tea but this is just personal nevertheless the clay plates are amazingly beautiful which adds a whole new level to the dining experience have yet to return for desserts but first i need to save up this place is pricey for their food definitely setting a different scene and drawing the coffee crowd to a wider approach to appreciating caffeine and food,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,really good ambience love the high ceilings wooden table coffee bar coffee menu was a little confusing i originally wanted a cappuccino but they did not have it on the menu only stated black white and filter so i ordered the filtered coffee and asked if they have milk but was recommended to not have milk with the coffee so as to taste the flavors of the coffee the coffee turns out to be really good it comes in a little jug and a shot glass lol but would appreciate if the server could mention that they do have other coffees with milk if that is what i wanted for food we had the parsley and chili fries and baked almond cake fries were crispy and not too oily and the almond cake was pretty moist and i love the caramel brittles that came with it will come back for brunch next time and order their cappuccino,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,yum it was so good i was visiting singapore for two weeks and only got to eat there once but the turkish breakfast was to die for i also got a latte that was delicious very nice staff a bit crowded but that is how you knows it is good,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,i am officially on salad addiction and in my quest in finding good salad particularly one that has quinoa salad in singapore i stumbled upon here i have tried quite a few salad places in singapore and have to say this one made it to the top of my top salad list i just have to put my two cents comment given the negative reviews aplenty ordered kale salad from their lunch menu and would gladly give it an excellent score for its freshness it is perfectly young and crisp and lightly seasoned with enough zing on the dressings and most importantly no soggy kale it is appalling how some places could served their salad wilted and soggy for its quality and freshness and definitely consistency considering i am coming here on a weekday on an off peak hour i would say the meal justifies the price the service here is above average for singapore standard the staff acknowledge you and seated me promptly i would definitely be a frequent this place if not for the inconvenient stand alone location and the price being rather not wallet friendly,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,amazing place the house blend of coffee has a deep robust flavour without being bitter or tasting burnt the breakfast is fantastic and the selection is broad service is not only friendly but amazingly speedy highly recommended the only downsides are that i find the bar seating to be rather cramped trying to fit my legs under the bar and that it gets rather crowded at times so there is a bit of a queue and it is rather noisy however if you are looking for some hustle and bustle this is not necessarily a bad thing,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,these guys deserve a great review for their level of service at the very least the attitudes of the staff makes this place top tier even before i tried the food the food and drinks make this that much more enjoyable my girlfriend and i spent our sunday afternoon looking for a good place to grab a good brunch and came across common man coffee roasters through a friend we walk in and have a seat at the bar notice the place completely packed with a young to middle aged crowd cool vibe i ordered the veggie wonderland dish which had eggs over artisan sourdough toast a really good kind of mushroom i believe portobello veggies tomatoes and something that tasted like a really good soft cheese i also ordered a side of their chorizo hash browns which i did not regret at all did the apple pear celery juice and a coffee this is a lot of food so be wary but it was worth every bite loved it i did not yet finish my coffee so the owner came and asked if i wanted a new fresh cup or if something was wrong with it so awesome these guys really do care about whether or not you enjoy the food or if they can improve my girlfriend ordered the green pea fritters and the hummus the hummus and pita bread were fantastic the green pea fritters she said were ok but the staff noticed afterwards that she did not eat the fritter patty itself they said that they tried it and it was not up to their standards so they gave us dessert on the house and took off the fritters from the bill we did the deconstructed cheesecake which was interesting it grew on both of us and by our third bites we really started enjoying it highly recommend for brunch great coffee too,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,just had brunch here and food was delicious there was a queue when we got there but i thought overall service was good food was good i got the pear apple celery juice and iced latte i think the coffee is good here but it is more for the serious coffee drinkers i recommend all the dishes i took a photo of they all tasted delicious i would definitely come back for the food coffee is on the sour side for me but again i think it is for the serious coffee drinkers i do not think coffee should be mixed with orange or lemon skin but i know some coffee places do that and this place is one of them,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,amazing breakfast had the kale and eggs and waffles delicious a bit pricey for breakfast but worth it,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,nice trendy place with great coffee i did not eat here but all of the food i am seeing brought to the tables around me looks fabulous,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,if u just had your brunch and then still craving for a good sweetness come to this place the pancake is so good it has crumble salted caramel raspberry and also nice maple syrup on it the ambience is awesome thats why i suggest if u want to go here make a reservation before is the right thing to do enjoy,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,this is a good place for meet for breakfast before work though at these prices probably more of a special occasion type breakfast rather than a regular one i had visited at am on a weekday and it was practically empty just us and another table i had the full english breakfast which was a mixed bag the scrambled eggs were decent and the baked beans mushrooms and spinach were good the bacon let is talk about bacon bacon is very important i think we all agree and even though overall i enjoyed my meal at common man coffee roasters i have to say this is possibly the first time i have met a strip of bacon that i did not like i have no idea how it was cooked in the oven but it was dry and brittle and not particularly tasty which is kind of tragic for bacon service staff were nice and friendly though not very attentive i have to say with hardly any customers they were sort of just drifting around at the edges of the cafe and not really looking at customers which made flagging them down a challenge,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,a great selection of high grade coffees prepared professionally espresso and manual brew options available i also tried the breakfast menu the beans were excellent many other dishes served near by looked equally good thoroughly recommended,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,every time i tried to go here for brunch there would be a line snaking out the front door every time finally we smartened up one day and made our way down here at am no line yet but the place was already full and we were seated on the bar not a real problem since there were only two of us i immediately zero ed in on the turkish common man breakfast  i knew i would love that stuff my breakfast companion went with the vegetarian brunch which is my second option bc they have grilled haloumi and i cant say no that we each also got a cup of the black coffee verdict loved it they are not your typical brunch dishes yet still tasty and filling that crispy feta is freakin delicious and the egg wrapped in some crispy stuff forgot what it was is something i have never seen before had a few bites of the vegetarian brunch too and it was equally delicious coffee was good too cannot fault this place i also spotted churros in the dessert menu but was way too full after my main dish will definitely come back once the crowd has settled down if they ever will the line was already snaking out the door again when we left right around noon,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,love the feel of this place and the food is great although that might be a personal taste if you like organic feeling food with veg grains and nuts you will enjoy the food the coffee and tea is a definite yes though,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,brunch and there is a line equally good sign and annoying getting seated was quicker than expected though and i was very sure the eggs benedict i had chosen were the best things possible until i tried the green pea fritters holy moly super churros too and spotless coffee but they are roasters so it better be all thumbs up,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,the organic eggs benedict was life changing the absolute best i have had i wish they made them like this back in the us the meat the eggs the sauce the bread all perfect as for the cafe mocha i am a better human being for drinking that absolutely perfect,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,this place is awesome especially when it is within walking distance from home the decor is really chic huge glass windows perfect for people watching i have only had their coffee so no comment on the food maybe next time soy latte was smooth and rich the only minus is the uncomfortable chair designed with a steel bar instead of an actual back ac is a little too strong but that is everywhere in singapore,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,this is the kind of place everybody recommends i had not been there because they close a bit too early in the afternoon for my taste we ended up going there for a saturday breakfast a little bit by accident the place seemed packed but they managed to squeeze us at the bar just beside the coffee machine my first impression was that of a place with personality with a specific atmosphere it is not openly hipster which is a relief even for hipsters it is more on the oldish elegant style the green granite bar works as a centrepiece and visual anchor to this th century styled place it is like some of those big restaurants from the sixties or seventies but with true charm industrial touches and without the decadent depressing look it is lively and noisy sitting in front of the baristas we noticed they did not have a minute is rest while we were there service is fast and hectic but precise and quite friendly i had the turkish breakfast which turned out to be a delight the eggs were a tiny bit on the dry side but still runny the pita bread was fantastic the whole dish was served with precision and the flavour combination phyllo pastry olives fried feta tomato and cucumber was a welcome explosion the coffee was good quality almost but not on par with a certain joint i love on everton park it was crisp and acid as i like it prices are rather expensive for breakfast that must be noted it is not your everyday breakfast joint it is more like a treat so it is up to anyone to decide if it is worth the hype they have another locale at the second floor that might be worth seeing i think there is more to enjoy at common man i will go back to explore more of what they do,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,a place for kopi and you tiao not okay i was half kidding i ordered their western hemisphere equivalents a pour over coffee and churros they are not half bad really but i found their churros really small for s  really nothing is exotic about the flour and sugar that goes into these things these are usd  a piece and even less for  pesos in mexico i also purchased a pack of their whole beans for brewing at home it was okay but not really worth the price premium the dark furniture funky interior and custom ceramic cups added to the hipster vibe cool hangout spot a place to see and be seen however pricing wise everything is still a little steep maybe next time,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,great coffee great ambience great service great food come early on the weekends it gets packed,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,this review is long overdue especially given my below average experience let is start with the good  the space is great and you cannot deny the wow factor as soon as you walk in the door the coffee is decentok now on to my experience firstly this place is pricey think sydney prices which would be acceptable if we lived in sydney and even then i do not think the food is of the same quality secondly i ordered a takeaway flat white here once before but i may as well have sat in because no one served me until i looked for a waitress there were people behind the counter but completely distracted and then it took  minutes for a take away coffee what the i could have let this all go if i would had a good food experience but i did not one hungover sunday i thought the burger would be a good idea it was actually a very bad idea given the burger that turned up on my plate was raw not rare but raw i sliced through the middle of my burger super excited to have that first big messy bite but the inside was cold and i will say it again raw i had to fight a reflex retch motion slightly embarassed as was dining with new friends i waved down a waiter who took it back to the kitchen to be re cooked no apology in the meantime my dining companions all finished their meals i filled up on the fries and i then had to conspicuously eat my returned burger where both halves of the meat patty had been recooked and reserved in front of everyone my appetite was well and truly over and i would not have even finished half of it not an ideal outcome especially given the burger is a steep  when paying the bill i was asked how the meal was of course i gave my opinion tactfully of course but was told the burger is usually served medium if that was the case why was i not given a refund with juice and coffee the bill added up to  per person insert whistle noise here ok rant over i will just vote with my feet next time and suggest elsewhere,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,common man coffee roasters has been creating waves on the coffee scene well with the partnership of indie coffee father harry grover of  hands australia is five senses coffee and the lifestyle conglomerate spa spirit group it is no wonder why and how cmcr is drawing in the crowd located at  martin road common man coffee roasters join the many artisan coffee shops e g kith cafe toby is estate smitten in the robertson enclave to provide us brunch hungry singaporeans with a reason to wake early on weekends be prepared to wait for your table but be thankful that breakfast does not run out because they serve an all day breakfast menu the decor and vibe is very aussie i like the cool bar seats which plays with varying heights and those spotlights sure do make me feel like i am on broadway i cannot help but notice the sign behind the bar that says free coffee and doughnuts for the unemployed well i do not see any doughnuts on the menu and you definitely would be paying an arm or leg for the pricey food that is served at cmcr really there is nothing common man about the prices i mean god what did eggs become so expensive in singapore ignoring the little dishes for breakfast the heartier options like the common man full breakfast turkish cm breakfast are all in the mid s range i have no qualms with spending  bucks on brunch with coffee but even i am feeling the pinch here expect higher prices for the lunch menu desserts also go at a whooping  organic eggs benedict  with two poached eggs on top of tender braised ox cheeks and lightly toasted artisanal sourdough toast this has been raved about by many well at least it is a fresh take on the typical but always satisfying eggs ben the meat was very tender the eggs flawlessly poached and the hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy in terms of texture everything felt rich i e on the oily side but it was a bland dish i was expecting the braised ox cheeks to be more umami but it was just meaty the hollandaise also lacked the tangy citrus taste the richness of the dish was a little discomforting towards the end of the meal so it was a good thing that the portion is small my mocha  was stellar w judges v and i and anyone who orders mocha because he feels that it conceals the quality of the coffee with the cloying sweetness from the chocolate however this mocha was nicely perfumed with the intense chocolate aroma and i thought it enhanced the flavor of the smooth coffee common man coffee roasters is not for the common man but it is ok to indulge in an expensive plate of eggs once in a while i guess,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,very western do not expect to be able to buy a nice cup of kopi here the iced coffee was on point the nitro cold brew was super smooth and simply excellent the ambiance is beautiful very well decorated great staff used this place as my office for the day thank you,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,my friend raved about common man so much he ended up bringing me here for brunch honestly i hardly eat pancakes in cafes like these but their pancakes i forgot the name with fruit crumbles were sooo good fluffy and filling churros were exquisite too also for this weekend oct st and nd they will be having almond macadamia mlk by the mlk co upstairs on grounded to drink with your coffee cannot wait,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,i love this place and their food their common man breakfast is amazing the beans are delicious yes the beans the potato tomatoes bread and eggs are yummy the meat is just okay though not a fan of the sausage but its worth it juts for the beans seriously have also tried their muesli and yogurt pretty good very nutty the churros are also amazing dipped in chocolate goodness they should give you a bigger portion of chocolate though,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,i went for lunch not breakfast like most other reviewers the venue is great and i really liked their filter press coffee the service is average by singaporean standards read rushed and un attentive they brought me a sandwich with no napkins and i had to ask for those fries with no ketchup and i also had to ask for that the disappointing part was the food i ordered a pulled pork sandwich when it came it was dripping liquid from the meat so much that within  secs the brioche bun was totally soggy and started falling apart really hard to eat it when i finished the plate it came in had a half cup of liquid in it never had a pulled pork sandwich like this here is the kicker false advertisement the free coffee and doughnut for unemployed claim in big cubic characters over the bar is not true when i asked about this i was told is just a reminder of what well perhaps of the fact that if you are unemployed you should stay away i spent  for lunch for a sandwich and a coffee,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,a little expensive for its food menu but then again the menu is unique and different than other coffee place in singapore they spent a lot for the decor which is a great place for catching up with friends and just hang around,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,overpriced for what it offers ambiance is good but the experience does not live up to the price kale salad with basically nothing special costed,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,common man coffee roasters cmcr is notoriously crowded so if possible avoid the peak brunch lunch hours or be prepared to wait in line even at pm in the afternoon on a weekend the buzzy cafe was swarming with expats and their spg hanger ons and teenybopper ya hipster sorts obviously i did not like the ambience the pretentiousness was exacerbated by how intrusively close the tables were to one another i could hear everything our neighbouring diners were chatting about at least the food and service were faultless the breakfast eggs were innovative hearty and delicious while service was spontaneous and upbeat we had  organic eggs benedict  layered with luscious braised ox cheeks a velvety smooth chive hollandaise toasted sourdough and contrasted with the peppery kick of arugula leaves turkish common man breakfast  comprised a duo of phyllo crusted soft boiled organic eggs on a hummus bed flecked with battered feta olives arugula pickled cucumbers and fresh tomato slices all ready to be mopped up by soft pita bread i liked the bright and tangy flavours in this one  sauteed kale egg white scramble  tossed with snow peas asparagus broccoli sweet potato leaves seasoned with lemon zest crumbs and showered over with grated parmesan wisps light and healthy without compromising on taste,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,after a week in singapore i had my fill of noodles fish and indian food i found cmcr on an expat website it was excellent i had the organic eggs benedict the braised ox cheeks were very tasty i had a cup of black coffee to accompany my benedict great experience and highly recommend cmcr,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,i really wanted to like this place a work colleague suggested it and i had heard really good things about it i was brunching with a vegetarian friend so it seemed like a good option thankfully she got there right around  on sunday and beat a hell of a line that came in right after her the place is not super big and they have managed to squeeze every last table they can in there it is noisy and very hipster and trendy that part did not bother me i ordered a latte my friend had a kale juice which was baby sized and for my brunch i had the kale egg white scramble she had the veggie platter both were not the most exciting options on the menu but at  i expected a hell of a lot more my plate was under seasoned and just boring i had the option of adding chicken but could not bring myself to spend  for chicken kale and a  eggwhite alcohol options are limited as well so if you are looking for a boozy i was not at least not this time brunch this is not your place honestly i could have made my dish at home for  i think my dining partner enjoyed hers but it is veggies how hard can it be my latte on the other hand was more like an espresso there was no milk in it and it was think like oil so strong i actually had to choke it down just because i needed the caffeine kick service started off strong but then took about  minutes after our plates were cleared to get the bill which i had to flag down our waitress for total bill was about  highly unlikely i will return with so many other dining options in the area,Negative
common-man-coffee-roasters,let me start by saying i love this place its one of the best coffee and western breakfast places in singapore regardless of the bar being set pretty low everything i have tired here i love the food is great the layout ambience is great i love walking in every time all that aside here is where you can improve god knows there is room the service here has been mixed to say the least whenever we have been hosted by casey its been super efficient knowledgeable and smooth unfortunately there is other people who work there dishes never seem to be able to be brought out together ever if i am coming out for lunch breakfast with people i actually want to eat lunch breakfast with people not sit there with half the table with plates of food getting cold waiting for the rest to come out normal etiquette is to not start eating until everyone is served especially in western countries so why the f k do half of my group consistently have to wait sometimes   mins for their food to come out after the first plates are laid on our table getting cold i have brought this up when ordering and been met with the chef will try sorry not good enough being a good chef and running a good kitchen is not just about the quality of food coming out of it its about timing as well time the orders so everything comes out together this is your job if you cannot do this f k back off to whatever hawker stall you were working in before landing a job at common man even when the last dishes come out like today  mins after the first ones somehow half the stuff on the plate is barely warm how does this happen what do i do send it back again and have the  dishes served some  mins ago turn from luke warm to stone cold while mine is cooked from scratch again this all goes back to timing there is something seriously wrong happening in that kitchen that needs to be addressed apart from timing there is also an issue of how knowledgable the staff are on coffee and coffee blends this is not a normal cafe for gods sake this is a serious roasters importing raw beans from around the world and roasting on site i expect the staff to understand the difference between the blends and talk a customer through especially if you are charging upwards of  a cup usually when asking staff about the blends of the day i am handed some scrunched up piece of paper out of their top pocket with a print out of the blends currently being served thanks for the insight common man do not get me wrong you are my go to brunch place you have the crowds you have the momentum but with that please do not become complacent the customers you are serving to are fickle you are verging on the edge of being a pretty good place to a great place but just are not there yet,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,coffee drinkers who like their coffee on the more acidic side will enjoy a cup here to each his her own my personal preference is full flavored nutty so i enjoy toby is estate liberty symmetry chris cafe maison ikkoku more than common man,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,had heard a lot about this place so used a weekday spent recovering from a surgery to avoid the weekend crowds and try it out was not disappointed at all all four of us loved our meals mine was the fairly simple yet very tasty croque monsieur my brother had the pancakes that were unbelievable although maybe a bit too sweet rich for a full meal would suggest sharing and the girls had the eggs the turkish breakfast was beautifully presented and very well cooked while the common man breakfast was substantial but probably the the only disappointment of the four in that it was good without being great coffee was quite good too which is pretty rare in singapore only thing that stops this place getting a  star rating from me is that it is as most things in singapore are overpriced the breakfasts were not so bad but the juices were extreeeemely expensive given the small portion you actually get aside from that cool place friendly staff and a nice ambience will definitely come back if it is possible to avoid the long weekend waits,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,nice place for weekend brunch food is alright i tried turkish common man not too impressive probably will try something else next time,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,i like the feeling of lazy sunday brunch at a chilled place relaxing n chat with some friends good is really good beverage is great too a little expensive but worthy it if you hv a important friend joining you,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,loved the slick deco design and atmosphere it is buzzy for weekend brunch priced relatively high but you get quite a bit of bang for your buck spread around all the different items in a dish the turkish breakfast was the standout because of the egg wrapped in strands of filo and fried amazing looking i was pleasantly surprised by the number of veg breakfast options service was a little slow and haphazard at times par for the course the staff however is charming through the gaffes,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,for the high cost of a nice environment here you get cramped tables uncomfortable stool chairs and the usual river valley crowds it is yet another place for coffee snobs than for a nice casual and affordable breakfast or brunch i will take simple and affordable any day over high end looks and coffee like italian food breakfast does not need to be expensive any diner in the us does it better cheaper friendlier faster and with more options than anywhere i have seen in singapore they do have good service and good quality eggs the saltiness and olive oil on the eggs killed the taste for me to where i struggled to eat them our waitress dismissed my dissatisfaction as they being healthy that way a big no for future patronage french toast was a bit small for  warning for those who do not like added oil on your eggs be sure to specify without i see it like pepper do not put it on people is food unless you ask them first mention it on the menu and better yet rather than serve it with have it on the table for the customer to do for themselves i originally gave it a high three stars for the overall quality of ingredients and atmosphere but revised it to two because there is no   option as in reality we have not been back since this visit months ago in favour of other places and are not likely to return except out of boredom of our regular brunch places,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,this place does the best flat white their granola with yogurt and fresh fruit is delicious too but they are quite pricey two flat whites and one granola bowl around,Positive
common-man-coffee-roasters,this is probably now one of my go to places for weekend brunch and coffee the service is friendly and just attentive enough by singapore standards and the coffee is excellent the place is not cheap but i love the emphasis on organic free range ingredients and many menu items that you do not typically see in singapore like green pea fritters and quinoa salads you can also really see the difference in the coloration and consistency of the eggs there are not too many places around town where you can these kinds of ingredients on the menu much less cooked up to this standard the place also has a nice communal ambiance which i like but most importantly it is got style and substance given how busy it gets on the weekends it is maybe not the type of cafe to linger with your book laptop but it definitely a reliable place for an excellent breakfast lunch and coffee,Positive
toms-palette,nestled in a strange food complex think food court style stalls with a pub outside is tom is palette tons of flavors to pick from and the texture was really light yet creamy saw pipagao chinese cough syrup and had to try it was so strange but in a good way ended up with the matcha and plum both were delicious definitely worth a visit if you are close by,Negative
toms-palette,i enjoyed tom is a lot i had half passion fruit and half botany which was a mother is day special gelato with floral notes and some white chocolate pieces their flavours are very unique even includes pepago the traditional chinese cure all medicine syrup the texture was very creamy too i would highly recommend,Positive
toms-palette,the icecream flavors are really interesting and you get to choose  flavors in  small cup i had the passionfruit and milo dinosaur flavor and loved it,Positive
toms-palette,love the creativity and abundance of gelato flavours here but unfortunately the waffles lose out to merely and creamier still good location bugis and the  pm promotion means i will still visit frequently french waffle   starsvery eggy and warm out of the iron but slightly overcooked nothing extraordinary nice thing is they serve the waffles with crumbled oreos berry coulis and syrup on a pretty plate brownie waffle  starscrispier and more flavourful than their french waffle if you like chocolate or brownies i am neutral on both you will love these ice cream white chocolate nori  starslots of that umami seaweedy taste very generous with the chocolate chunks so frickin tasty yuzu  starslychee   starshas lychee chunks in it ale and crack candy   starssugar overload candied pecans yumminess triple s  starsshoyu sesame seeds salted chocolate super flavourful and slightly too salty but i love the uniqueness chocolate stout   starsif you like the title you will probably like this flavour salted egg yolk   starsunfortunately my least favourite of all the flavours i tried tastes like  but the texture lumpy gritty and there are already so many salted egg yolk desserts so i do not particularly want to taste it again in my ice cream cornflake  starsdisappointing compared to humphrey slocombe is secret breakfast and momofuku is cereal milk they also had some pretty standard flavours like rum raisin goma and more snazzy ones like banana honey roasted nuts smokey road salted caramel cheesecake mala chocolate but i could not try them all,Positive
toms-palette,interesting flavors and pleasant staff the stand in located in the back of shaw tower not too near to much we walked there from the fairmont hotel and were very pleased the flavor selections seem to rotate frequently you should try some of the flavors there seemed to be a large range from delicious to why would you make that into an ice cream flavor i found the alcoholic stout beer flavor to fall into the why did they make it category,Positive
toms-palette,i do not know how someone would just come across this place by chance it is tucked away down a hallway that does not appear to get much foot traffic i do not think there is any signage on the street outside either i recently visited on a tuesday afternoon and the building was dead except for a handful of people having ice cream here but it is worth the trip an excellent variety of traditional and non traditional flavors with good texture perfect antidote to hot humid singapore days,Positive
toms-palette,i have been doing myself a tremendous disservice by never checking this place out until now to think i spent three months interning across the road but never made tom is palette a priority the best part about tom is are the inventive delicious flavors it may be easy to dump thimbles of yuzu syrup into the ice cream machine but it is difficult to produce ice cream of the right sweetness and texture flavors include grannys favorite salted caramel cheesecake berries and split pi pa gao and of course usuals like chocolate strawberry i highly recommend the yuzu flavor it is sweet light and refreshing we also tried a mix of chocolate and grannys favorite a mix of chocolate malt marshmallows i think and spent awhile chilling in the spacious interior there are many tables and it reminds me of those student haunts at upper thomson also ah loy thai right opposite is superb another excuse to visit toms i wish there were more independent creameries ice cream shops like toms daily scoop creamier i have gotta play my part in supporting and frequenting them,Positive
toms-palette,i know of this place thanks to a yelper who recommended it not the easiest place to find as i had to use the goggle map to find its exact location located at shaw tower along beach road its on the ground flour just walk all the way in and you find it interior of this ice cream place looks ordinary and you would think this is just a normal ice cream place but wait till you try the flavours i was amazed with some of the unique flavours such as the granny is favourite and the salted egg yolk flavours you cannot get this anywhere else at least to me there are so many other flavours to try but having only one stomach i got to take it easy so coming back here is definitely in my agenda,Positive
toms-palette,never knew there were such ice cream flavors in existence until sample the hottest flavors typically   either the conniseurs recommends or the trays with less than half left to scoop from should hint preference the rum favourite,Negative
toms-palette,now getting there was not super easy because it is not very close to bugis mrt but this shop is nestled in an old building sort of dingy if you ask me i sampled a few flavors but i only really wanted to try the salted egg yolk one because i am a liu sha bao afterall i thoroughly enjoyed my ice cream but i suspect it was made with salted egg yolk powder not salted egg yolk itself nonetheless delicious until i found a lump of cold hard butter on the second last spoonful i nearly fainted from the revelation that a good load of butter was used in the production of my ice cream but  stars it is and yes i would most defo come back,Negative
toms-palette,i am not sure how i can do this place justice with just another review but i try cones waffles and cupswhich will i choose from herewhen will i stopi believe your ice cream brought me hereand we should be together babeyou are cold but hoti play it off but i am dreaming of youand i will keep my cool but i am feindingi try to say goodbye and i choketry to walk away and i stumblethough i try to hide it it is clearmy world crumbles when you are not neargoodbye and i chokei try to walk away and i stumblethough i try to hide it it is clearmy world crumbles when you are not neari may appear to be freebut i am just a prisoner of your flavoursand i may seem all right and smile when you meltbut my smiles are just a frontjust a front heyi play it off but i am dreaming of youand i will keep my cool but i am feindingi try to say goodbye and i choketry to walk away and i stumblethough i try to hide it it is clearmy world crumbles when you are not neargoodbye and i chokei try to walk away and i stumblethough i try to hide it it is clearmy world crumbles when you are not nearhere is my confessionmay you be my possessionboy i need you muchyuzu granny is wtfudgewith all my might i trybut this i cannot deny denyi play it off but i am dreaming of youbut i am dreaming of you babei will keep my cool but i am feindingi try to say goodbye and i choketry to walk away and i stumblethough i try to hide it is clearmy world crumbles when you are not theregoodbye and i chokei try to walk away and i stumblethough i try to hide it it is clearmy world crumbles when you are not neargoodbye and i chokei try to walk away and i stumblethough i try to hide it it is clearmy world crumbles when you are not near,Negative
toms-palette,i love the range of choices at tom is palette and they do change it quite frequently but somehow i always end up with my absolute  favorites granny is favorite and chocolate despite tasting the other flavors granny is favorite is just soooo goood that i am loathe to eat other flavors if i remembered correctly it has some horlicks to it and is a bit malty i am not sure if they still allow it but i used to be able to get  flavors in a cup not  scoops i thought that was a very nice practice as sometimes you do not want to have an entire cup of the same flavor the chocolate is rich and dark a bit bittersweet just the way i like my chocolate with no fillers or cheap ingredients ruining the taste,Positive
toms-palette,alas i have downgraded my review to four stars still exceptional ice cream the melt and sizzle is very tasty while a nasty mix is a little too sweet for my palate this time i got a medium of the latter and salted caramel cheesecake the cheesecake was scrumptious but the nasty mix caramel nuts and chocolate was far too sweet very busy on a friday evening so the service was rushed but that is to be expected,Positive
toms-palette,what a place with unique flavors excellent customer service and reasonable prices i got the honey lavender ice cream with banana walnut you can choose  flavors even for the smallest size and paid   the employees there are not shy about offering samples for their unique flavors which i also appreciated a great place to hit up after having spicy food next door at ah loy thai,Positive
toms-palette,great hidden place in bugis for fantastic ice cream it is in one corner of the shaw building across the road from the row of shophouses near bugis junction there is a variety of flavors and the speciality is the layers in textures with ingredients rather than just plain ice cream the flavors change from time to time and when i visited a few caught my eye salted egg yolk white chocolate nori seaweed grandma is favorite chocolate malt dough and yuzu etc customer service was very good and sample servings were big p,Positive
toms-palette,impressed with the innovative flavours of the ice cream but slightly disappointed with the taste had the salted cheesecake and salted coconut flavours both were too sweet for my liking but overall i would say if you have a sweet tooth and love to try interesting flavours like salted egg yolk and other alcoholic flavours then this place is for you,Positive
toms-palette,interesting flavours to cool you down in warm humid singapore throughly enjoyed the egg waffles topped with chilli chocolate and salted egg definitely favours that shouts local and hardly available elsewhere friendly and enthusiastic service tops it off,Positive
toms-palette,tom is palette is easily my favourite ice cream joint in singapore it is got interesting flavours which change all the time friendly staff and prices as well as an overall fun casual vibe food i am in love with the melt sizzle a mixture of berries and chocolate chunks already sounds pretty amazing but wait till the pop rocks zing and sizzle on your tongue making it a regular party in your mouth i also love the mocha macnut which as its name says is a generous mixture of macadamia nuts in mocha ice cream the rose and lavender flavours are also really unique for those who appreciate something novel and light which i do but as my ice cream philistine of a friend remarks it could feel like eating potpurri the salted caramel is also really good but i tend to like texture in my ice cream so i get bored after a spoonful or two ambience fun and casualservice polite and friendlyshaw towers is a bit out of the way for me but i try to make a pilgrimage there once a month,Positive
toms-palette,fresh update triple coconut even better than the previously reviewed coconut dublin coffee is awesome with a hint of guinness toms palette always surprises with wonderful flavours the ice cream texture however is less than perfect but that is okay the flavours make up for it test drive a couple of flavours before you commit,Positive
toms-palette,their salted caramel cheesecake ice cream is just brilliant it is my most favorite ice cream ever the flavor is just so rich and indescribable sweet and savory at the same time each scoop is pure delight pair this with granny is favorite and you have got my idea of the perfect ice cream duo granny is favorite is chocolate ice cream with random burst of malt that seem to complement salted caramel cheesecake perfectly i have yet to try other flavors from tom is just because i was so blown away by these two flavors that i always end up going for them i need to be more adventurous eh,Positive
toms-palette,tom is palette was my first dalliance with artisan ice cream and i definitely put on weight in my  month internship because i kept popping downstairs for ice cream breaks while there are a zillion fancy ice cream shops out there these days tom is palette remains one of my favourites because it has such great flavours at any one time there is a wide range to choose from and the flavours are always changing they do really great local and seasonal flavours pineapple tart ice cream during chinese new year really tastes like pineapple tarts but their simple flavours like chocolate and vanilla are also done exceptionally well another small but important point tom is palette allows you to mix  flavours even in their smallest cup so you do not have to settle on just one flavour the pain of having to choose,Positive
toms-palette,i agree with adri on this one discovering tom is palette is across the road from my office is like opening a bag of kettle chips the style of ice cream made there is totally up my alley fresh dense on your spoon but light and smooth on your tongue sure i am a purist at times and like my ice cream clean with just one flavor but when you have mix in is done right at tom is i promise you it is futile to resist i have had the savory something cannot remember the name chocolate sorbet nuts and such well basically all the nut variants a tea based flavor and i have yet to fail to completely lick my cup clean in other words picky me has not found anything bad about their ice cream and that is ridiculous annnd i cannot even bother to remember the flavors because i am too busy stuffing it down the cafe itself looks like a napkin monster vomited all over the place and  year old is decided they could not let all that white stuff go to waste eat your ice cream enjoy it and close your eyes if you have to,Positive
toms-palette,this place is tucked in a corner of shaw leisure gallery just before the food court basically you can have  flavours of ice cream for all sizes they are not cheap but really quite worth it for the taste beside ice cream you can have milk shake waffles and hot tea too i have the salted egg yolk ice cream which was partly inspired by the hong kong yolk filled custard buns in it taste like the salted egg yolk found in mooncake but surprisingly it is not salty with a tad of sweetness creamy rich and filled with yolk in grainy forms it was surprisingly good and really a refreshing take on the good old ice cream i also had my usual favorite chocolate it was quite chocolatey and really one of the best chocolate ice creams that i have had overall this is really one of my favorite ice cream places around,Positive
toms-palette,tom is palette is a shop selling a wide variety of ice creams most of them being self creations it is situated right opposite another famous delight ah loy thai at level one inside shaw towers you will be greeted by a group of friendly staff who will offer to let you try a number of flavours which you request or they recommend some of the more popular ones are granny is favourite rum raisin and salted caramel cheesecake i myself would prefer summer berries as someone who like fruits they will also create some new flavours every now and then so do try them out and some might just keep you coming back they even allow you to mix two flavours in a cup so in case you are indecisive just pick another flavour their prices range from a small cup at   a medium one at  to a large one at  if you happen to be from schools like sim smu ntu nus check out their website for the full list you will even be entitled a  off,Positive
toms-palette,fantastic so many creative and delicious flavors i had a really hard time choosing i sampled at least  different ones and just ended up picking randomly because there was no clear favorite they were all so good  stars for the creativity many sweet savory combos flavors with extras mixed in and unexpected flavors that work really well ended up choosing the melt sizzle with bits of berry and chocolate pieces and brown sugar cinnamon yummnot a fan of the location but i cannot take away a star for that it is hidden down the hallway on the right hand side of the lobby of the building on the corner of middle and beach rds definitely worth seeking out,Positive
toms-palette,nestled in shaw tower is the homemade icecream at tom is palette is a true gem the icecreams have amazing depth of flavour with similar smoothness and density of italian gelato and with all creations made from hand by tom and his team there is a reason why everyone loves it my friend had trouble deciding what icecream took his fancy tom the owner was happy to suggest numerous flavours and provide generous taste testers to help with the decision process tom shed some light on how he and his team make the icecream and the creative process in inventing new and exciting flavours my friend decided on the chocolate sorbet which was like eating pure cocoa chocolate it is not for a subtle palette as it is made without dairy making it very strong and rich luckily i was more than happy to finish of the rest when my friend had enough of the rich flavours i had the much raved about salted egg yolk icecream it was interesting to say the least it had a floury taste that coated my mouth followed by the sweetness and creaminess of the egg yolk complimenting the saltiness the salted egg yolk is definitely an experience and one that i could happily relive after doing a bit more searching i found out that they offer icecream lessons normally on a sunday i would love to attend and learn more about the icecream making process and how the simple ingredients of egg milk sugar and cream can result in some truly fantastic creations for more information head to their website,Positive
toms-palette,the flavors and taste of the ice creams here are as good as it gets the amount of savory ice cream they serve includes a lot of different local taste for  scoops of ice cream it is at a very affordable price of   the must try for the place is the slated eggyolk ice cream this particular flavor packs a punch as the smoothness of both the egg and the cream come very well together the taste of the yolk is distinct but not too over powering i have tried this flavor and it was superb it is also the pick among a lot of people who frequents this place people who love ice cream should go for the granny is favorite rum chocolate savory crunch and for coffee lovers you can try the coffee cheesecake there are a lot of different flavors to choose from and depending on your taste mix match as you like,Positive
toms-palette,i came here on the recommendation of the salted egg yolk ice cream being the adventurous foodie that i am thought i could not miss that out and i thank the adventurous foodie boldness in me for giving it a go because it is just spacey out of this world i always like a joint that colours a little bit outside the lines and dares to put unheard of yet delicious flavours out there for their customers and tom is palette is one of the few places that dares to push the envelope of your taste buds in a good way also tried the much raved about melt sizzle the staff recommended it to me absolutely adore the idea of having pop rocks in your ice cream you will feel like charlie in the ice cream factory with their creative creations and i cannot wait to taste more new flavours,Positive
toms-palette,this is my favourite ice cream place in singapore i do not care how many fancy new homemade ice cream places pop up here seriously why do people mix crap into their ice cream and put up with light as air healthier egg free less sugar bullshit serious ice cream angst overeverything is so no nonsense no frills here even their decor thankfully their ice cream making madskillz are far better than their interior design skillz i am convinced they are mad geniuses try the sea salt caramel ice cream or granny is favourite when they have the mad flavours like the salted egg yolk or potato chip flavoured ice cream try them all even the regular chocolate is the best imho i could eat a few tubs a day and live happily in largesse,Positive
toms-palette,this is one of the best home made ice cream i have tasted so far the shop has similar style as other ice cream stall such as udders however the ice creams flavour they offer are very creative and unique do check out their flavour of the month and you will be surprised to find exotic flavours which you will never expect to appear as ice cream occasionally they do have mini challenge such as mystery flavours and chili challenge if you are an alcholic ice cream fan do give their rum and raisin and chocolate stout a try the rum and raisin is well balance between the rum and the sweetness of the rum and the chocolate stout simply compliments each other remember to flash your student card for some discount,Positive
toms-palette,before the icecream story started chronos was working in the mechanical engineering industry not quite something we would associate with the sweet treat just  years ago chronos decided to create his own cold plate inspired by the icecream brands he came into contact with overseas completing it after a year he decided to start creating his own unique icecream flavours many of which we find in stores today melt sizzle was a fun flavour to try with pops inside the icecream they literally crack in your mouth as well as the flavourful chocolate sorbet they also have new flavours from time to time but you have a safe bet with the classic flavours too,Positive
toms-palette,tucked in a quiet corner of shaw towers is tom is palette an unpretentious shop that sells homemade ice cream i usually go to tom is palette in weekday afternoons to avoid the crazy after work or weekend crowds that weekday the friendly staff warmly welcomed us into the shop with genuine smiles on their faces leaving a great impression they also graciously allowed customers to try as many flavors as they wanted before they decided on their purchase tom is palette concoct original ice cream flavors to suit the local palate coconut horlicks sarsi and salted egg yolk to name a few i ordered a medium cup with  flavors granny is favorite and rum raisin granny is favorite is one of their best sellers here and it is no wonder since it is a smooth blend of chocolate malt and chocolate chip cookie dough though not overly sweet it is sufficiently sweet to give you a sugar rush for the entire day the rum in rum raisin was prominent with bitter rum soaked raisins that were satisfying,Positive
toms-palette,everyone loves ice cream and if you are a ice cream lover try tom is palette firstly their ice cream flavours are all created by the owners themselves and it not only taste so good you have leave the place smiling like a little kid yes as most have already recommended try the salted egg ice cream even if you are not a fan of salted egg the unique and interesting taste might change your taste in salted egg i am serious it is sweet like ice cream should be and yet the taste of salted egg is rich and strong i could not help imagining the actual salted egg or you can try the granny is favourite i will definitely put that in my recommendation list pen down your thoughts and write your little notes around the shop too,Positive
toms-palette,amongst the various hot spots for yummy food at shaw towers is the famous ice cream store tom is palette with a simple and bright layout the store itself seemed welcoming enough and it was brilliantly located right opposite ah loy is thai we have been gluttons many a time getting up from our spicy thai meal and strolling  steps across the corridor to tom is for a scoop or two of creamy ice cream to put out the flames on our tongue my favourite is the horlicks paired with granny is favourite which is a malty chocolate flavor it tastes a lot milkier and creamier than the usual ice cream to the point where it is almost the consistency of gelato i like since they pride themselves in creating a new flavor each month i love trying out some of their more innovative ice creams like oolong tea wasabi lime and red wine ice cream although some of them are too extreme for me to have a full scoop i still give  stars for creativity and persistence in their concept,Positive
toms-palette,tom is palette has been both my source of joy and woe joy because they always have a great new flavor to try woe because after multiple ice cream pig out sessions i could hardly squeeze into my office shirts anymore the first defining trait of this local grown parlour is the awesome variety they have even their traditional staples are whacky in their own way i have always enjoyed the chocolate stout granny is favourite a mix of banana and chocolate and salted egg yolk ice cream on my last visit i had their breakfast flavor a delicious mix of kaya and banana toffee if you want to turn on the sinful factor mix two flavors in milkshake form the day i tried their hazelnut and rum raisin i was torn between a world of bliss and the worry that i would suffer from cardiac arrest the price hardly does the quality justice at   for a small scoop of  flavors you cannot get any better the sheer range of the selection will make you want to come back and bring all your friends,Positive
toms-palette,try their salted egg yolk ice cream yes that is one of the flavors they have there and the most interesting one it created quite a hoo ha when we tried it among ourselves general consensus was it is very good there is this grainy taste much like having real salted egg but cushioned with the sweet icy taste of frozen milk other flavors which i like include the ones with the magic dust that sizzles and pops in your mouth and their salted caramel i think most of their flavors are excellent so it really is up to personal choice it can get really noisy and crowded on weekends though so be prepared for it not an ideal place for chit chats definitely just enjoy your cup of goodness and go,Positive
toms-palette,whatever adrianna saidyou know what makes it more impressive it is not plain chocolate ice cream that they make it is chocolate sorbet no milk no cream all good chocolatey richness and you would not even know it i love them for the quality of their flavours the consistency of the ice cream are you surprised that tom was an engineer everything has a point it is not alcohol for alcohol is sake my favorite flavour is chocolate stout you do not taste the booze you taste the richness it is not mix ins for the sake of mix ins or worse weirdness for the sake of weirdness there are some great local flavours thai tea mango sticky rice and some things that push the envelope salted egg anyone and the staff are enthusiastic about making sure you taste and sample before making a selection i really appreciate that tom is does a children is size too quality counts for so much more than quantity omnomnom,Positive
toms-palette,i had mocha macnut mocha ice cream with white chocolated coated macadamia and almond nuts and milk ice cream the mocha macnut tasted more chocolatey and the bits of crunchy macadamia and almond nuts made it even nicer the milk ice cream was full on milk flavour nothing else to describe it although it lacks behind other places which offered similar milk flavours which tasted more concentrated,Positive
artscience-museum,this is a really nice museum i highly recommend it i bought a ticket on klook and went to the disney magic of animation exhibit that is open until the end of march i was also hoping to go to the future world exhibit but because it was during a peak vacation period i did not make it there in time luckily that exhibit is permanent so i will come back another time to see it hopefully the magic of animation exhibit is really nice if you are an animation fan i used to work at pixar so this was right up my alley they have original storyboards and art from the production of most of the majorly popular disney movies from steamboat willie to frozen ii finally i want to mention that the lines were incredibly long as this was around new year is day i recommend reserving at least a half day or more to see two exhibits since i was being rushed out of the magic of animation exhibit since they were closing the museum for the evening,Positive
artscience-museum,located in the iconic lotus shaped building at marina bay sands the future world exhibit is a must see the collection of interactive artworks are aesthetically pleasing from the moment you enter you will be immersed in the world of visual arts and interactive structures with over a dozen themed rooms here are some of my favorites sketch town allows visitors to color a preset drawing personalize it scan and watch your masterpiece come to life on the screen i did a quick coloring of a truck personalized it with my name on the side and watched in awe as it is displayed across the screen media block chair consists of vibrant glowing blocks that changes into countless variation of colors when attached together designed for visitors to create fun structures from stacking and arranging the blocks into whatever your imagination pleases crystal universe is not only extraordinary but breathtaking as well it features captivating animated lights that changes colors at an instant the occasional supernova gives you the illusion of being in a celestial environment surrounded by shimmering stars if you are press for time or are only interested in doing just one exhibit i highly recommend future world it is  sgd per adult and  sgd for children   whether you are seeking an educational or fun adventure or looking for a distraction this modern marvel will provide hours of fascination for visitors of all ages,Positive
artscience-museum,one of my favorite spots in singapore located near the marina bay this place definitely fits the futuristic and polished vibe in all aspects the artscience museum houses various displays that will surely amaze you ticketing allows you to choose a single exhibit or combinations of any of what you are interested in making it your money is worth and tickets are not too bad to begin with if you are a student be sure to get the discounted prices we decided to see future world and floating utopias and were wowed future world various rooms with interactive light and digital art displays it is perfect for photos due to rooms that contain very aesthetically pleasing sets there is also rooms that allow for your imagination to come to life by allowing your doodles to become digital renderings that move around in a virtual city the light displays are magical and let you use your smart device to control them floating utopias is more informative but still has some photo ops there is a room with giant inflatable rabbits a moon and much more this one was more lowkey and it balances out everything else overall highly recommend this place it is beautiful and gives you a sense of how futuristic singapore truly is plus you will get some cool photos from your visit here,Positive
artscience-museum,you can buy one exhibit two or all i would not mind getting all right next to helix bridge and always someone there to answer questions cute science art quotes on the walls and a spectacular place for both kids and adults future world meets science exhibit it is small visually pleasing and the room at the end where you enter space the lights are amaaazing the security guy can control the lights but can only tell you when super nova is coming stick around for that downstairs upon entering you walk into the fab cafe they have d printing available and cute little earrings too popcorn flavors like calamari sour cream and onion and also prosciutto snacks available remember that around holidays it can get really busy,Positive
artscience-museum,it is one of the best place to look at exhibitions in singapore i love the alice in wonderland love the imagination future world magical and light exhibition good for ig videos,Positive
artscience-museum,good place to take your kids out for an afternoon especially if they have those kid friendly exhibits running at the time my friend and i bought all three exhibits and it was nice seeing how educational they are some of the kids oriented ones are very interactive the one we saw had the interactive drawings where you could see your car or house come to life on the big screen on the wall if you sign up for a membership it was free if i remember correctly you can get a bogo deal essentially on tickets one for you and one for a friend which helps a lot in reducing the costs,Positive
artscience-museum,best museum i have ever been to the futureworld exhibit which seems to have a permanent home here is the most wonderful playground for imagination for both kids and adults from the moment you enter you will forget about outside world and be immersed in interacting with the environment there are several rooms that you will visit in order each with unique features from lounging on the beanie bag in a room surrounded by ocean waves to drawing and scanning images that will appear and float around on the walls last part is a play with led lights that mystical and sci fi at the same time on rd floor they have different exhibits and i am so happy to have made one on street art that outlines graffiti evolution and includes original art by some of the local artists overall i have been to this museum twice already and i cannot imagine visiting sg without going again i cannot give it enough stars,Positive
artscience-museum,great views of the flyer helix bridge and the lotus garden around the museum we got buy one get one free admission to the two exhibits there with the marina bay sands loyalty card  for two people and we had a lot of fun we could have spent easily   hours there and there was a lot to do read and explore very kid friendly they do a good job here with a good amount of variety and photo opportunities i would definitely come back and see different exhibits,Positive
artscience-museum,the exploratorium in san francisco is one of my favorite places on the entire world and has been since i was a tiny kid now the artscience museum gives it a run for its money an interactive museum we spent way more time here than a  year old and a  year old probably should have the futureworld exhibit is so much fun boasting about a dozen different installations admission is fairly standard with other museums at  sgd for adults my personal favorite was the crystal universe an expanse of fairy lights dangling from the ceiling that lit up to music think along the lines of yayoi kusama is works there were a handful of cute little installations of forests cityscapes and oceans they allowed for kids and shameless adults to color in animals and cars to scan into the scene such a cute idea it was pretty crowded when we were there with tons of people running about on a monday afternoon i think we would have enjoyed it more had there been about  of the people there we unfortunately were visiting during the few days in between other exhibits we missed the street art exhibit and were too early for the marvel there was not much information about the exhibition dates online so that was a real bummer we did participate in the into the wild interactive activity but got bored pretty quickly and gave up we also took a quick browse through the gift shop where there were some fun little things but did not have too much of a selection futureworld is definitely worth checking out if you have got an hour or so to kill in singapore would highly recommend especially if you are already around the marina bay sands and want a reprieve from the muggy heat,Positive
artscience-museum,alice in wonderland is on exhibit right now it is an interactive exhibit that has you reading and searching for clues if you love alice then be sure to go the exhibits change so check to see what is in before you head out i also enjoyed future world but this was definitely geared more for children,Positive
artscience-museum,this was such a waste of my time the art work literally made me laugh with the lack of talent it is s  a person for  min of my day that i cannot get back,Negative
artscience-museum,came here for the special exhibition and was blown awayyyyyyy we loved every part of it especially the infinity mirrors which is everyone is favourite hands down  recommend everyone to check this out if you are in singapore we used the student discount too,Positive
artscience-museum,this museum was truly one of the neatest museum i have ever been too singapore knows how to make the mark this museum has a cool exhibits the future exhibit was truly creative and neat it was truly artistic but had great factual accents to it the nature and human body exhibit was mind blowing we got to see the most futuristic robot which was so incredible and was able to carry a conversation with you the museum is located by the marina bay sands and a place where you and honestly spend hours at it is a great place to have a family adventure where you can bond learn and spend time at the exhibits are really great for all those who are photographers out there you will be able to really capture the beauty of this place if your ever in singapore check this place out it will be one of the highlights of your trip,Positive
artscience-museum,i think your experience here greatly depends on what exhibits are available we paid extra for two special exhibits marvel  year anniversary and wind walker along with the regular museum i really enjoyed the exhibits and felt the rest of the museum could have been a miss maybe it is more appealing to families with small kids when we went in august the future world was not open,Negative
artscience-museum,came here and had  options for exhibitions went to minimalism and it was right up my alley loved the future world exhibition as well you can play with the exhibitions and they are quite interactive definitely a must see in singapore if you have a few hours to walk around perfect for a rainy day,Positive
artscience-museum,review only for future world where art meets science exhibit i learned about the artscience museum from viewing an instagram story from travel instagrammer that i follow jack morris doyoutravel he posted a few ig stories of the future world exhibit i thought that it looked pretty cool and i wanted to check this out while in singapore admission for this exhibit was  sgd for adults and  sgd for seniors i e for my dad we came on our last day in singapore during the morning and spend    hours here there is  sections to view it is a fun and interactive exhibit that the kids will definitely enjoy as a grown adult woman i enjoyed it myself and my dad liked the exhibit too my favorite sections of this exhibit  black waves you will be in a dark room and there is animated ocean waves in the background there were some bean bags that you can sit on and relax while watching the animation  connecting block town the projection screen will show the animation when you move various block pieces on the table  sketch town you can draw and color cars trucks airplanes or buildings on a piece of paper you scan your completed image into a scanner then you will watch your drawing come to life on the huge animated projection screen  universe of water particles the animation of the waterfall was quite nice  sketch town aquarium similar to sketch town but you can draw and color a bunch of different sea creatures  light ball orchestra i saw that the kids had a lot of fun in this area it is a bunch of bouncy balls that changes color  crystal universe it was the last room and it was amazing i never experienced anything like it there is a pathway where you walk thru a bunch of animated lights note it maybe difficult to take a really cool photo here since the lights flicker changes very fast overall i had a fun time i cannot wait to comeback again one day to check out other cool exhibits,Positive
artscience-museum,we came here just for the futureworld exhibit which is reason enough to come here as it is pretty spectacular we really enjoyed every portion of it from the sea rising room to the crystal experience i also really liked the layout of the exhibit had a great flow from exhibit to exhibit and was easy to follow only downside is the ball room was just overrun with kids i know it is a museum and caters to all ages but made it a tad bit hard to enjoy when kids are throwing balls all over etc it reminded me a bit of the ball pit at chuck e cheese if i were them i would allocate a small section of the ball room for adults only or those adults without kids as it would be nice to enjoy it without having a ball hit you in the head my fav part was the crystal portion which is truly mesmerizing also the kids here were very well behaved prolly cuz they were mesmerized too,Positive
artscience-museum,really pricey for such short exhibitions the marvel universe experience was lame and for  was a total waste of money i am glad i came to it while in singapore but it is only a tourist trap the building itself is gorgeous and it is worth the trip just to say i have been there,Negative
artscience-museum,wow just wow this was the most interactive museum space i have ever seen i wish i would have taken my son you could literally spend hours in this place and still not experience it all it is on the marina bay sands campus so its really close favorite parts wave and waterfall roomscrystal light tunnelaquarium roomthe aquarium was probably the most interesting room to me you make a drawing of a sea creature and insert it into a machine which scans the image and animates it onto a screen that looks like an aquarium as you get close to the animated drawing it swims away from you it blew my mind and i am sure this description does not do it justice there was also a graffiti art show here with the original sheppard fairy obama screen print as well as his obey posters and a plethora of other artists there was even a wall you could tag on or put stickers on i was not expecting this type of experience walking in the door i would definitely recommend this not so humbly submitted michael c,Negative
artscience-museum,to be honest it was okay maybe because we have so many amazing science and art attractions in north america pricy for exhibits good to see but not a must see for me,Negative
artscience-museum,not only is this museum a jewel of architecture from the outside it hosts some of the best arts cultural exhibitions in singapore small but fine is the motto and thanks to its good location the visit can be combined with a walk in the gardens by the bay or dinner and shopping at the mall of marina bay recently we visited the current curated collection of the works of m c escher journey to infinity which is worth seeing if only for his mind blowing pieces on tessellation good to know tickets are available in the basement ground floor just hosts a caf and information show your singapore id card for concession price,Positive
artscience-museum,rude ticket seller her name jacquline please give her a proper training very disappointed to see this kinda talking back at the beginning of the trip at art museum other than that it was great for kids,Negative
artscience-museum,art or science when you could hardly make any decision this place could be great for both we came here for the exhibition the universe and the art my boyfriend likes art i like science especially space science so it was perfect beautiful exhibitions great service and great location right on that flower shaped building by the bay you could not really miss it a must see if you are a fan of art or science or both,Positive
artscience-museum,this museum stands out compared to the others i have been to this lotus shape building is definitely an attention seeker so i went here while visiting the marina bay sands i visited on november  which they hosted two exhibits hermes leather forever the nobel prize ideas changing the world tickets were complimentary the hermes exhibit was very eye catching but it was a very quick one for me since i am not really into it nonetheless it was somewhat interesting to see all the leather and colors incorporated for this product on the other hand i really liked the nobel prize exhibit there were lots of inspiring information from beginning to end it also highlights very influential individuals from around the world from what i heard they worked really hard on bringing this exhibit to singapore so it was nice to see it myself some of the displays were interactive as well which i liked must visit if you have time to spare,Positive
artscience-museum,i absolutely loved my visit to the artscience museum i came in with no expectations and bought tickets to the futureworld exhibit as we wandered from room to room we were stopped by the interactive exhibits and indulged in some fun there were a lot of people of all age ranges but because there is so much to see it is easy to get your fill of the different displays bring a good camera phone a bit of patience a couple friends and you can easily spend a half hour or so in awe of the different exhibits,Positive
artscience-museum,the architecture of the lotus shape building is art and engineering exhibit by itself free admission to the exhibit the nobel prize ideas changing the world the first section was about alfred nobel and how he started the nobel prize awards to honor inventor whose work improved our world the last section shines light figurative and literal on the individual innovations that links to our everyday items i found this museum very welcoming informative and classy a nice representation of singapore at its best,Positive
artscience-museum,the problem with some museums is that they can be a little hit or miss depending on what exhibition they happen to be showing at the time this was the case with this place because they had three exhibitions and only one that i was interested in and fortunately that was free the straight times history of singapore i guess it had more to do with me wanting to see culturally significant exhibitions that something such as the dreamworks exhibition that seem to be travelling around the world however it was not bad and it was really interesting learning about singapore through its major newspaper the building is really oddly shaped as one can expect from such a place though you really need to time yourself to see anything of interest,Negative
artscience-museum,while i was there the exhibits present were the deep and dreamworks animation both were fantastic though i enjoyed the dreamworks one more we bought the all access ticket which was  for the two main exhibits and the singapore eye contemporary art exhibit a smaller gallery on the third floor this ticket is the way to go if you are not in a rush it is truly a great deal in fact if you want to do just the main two exhibits without the contemporary art one it is more expensive more for less unlike the natural history museum tickets these tickets can be bought onsite the deep was all about deep sea underwater creatures like the different types of angler fish and the goblin shark while the topic is very mysterious and cool i do not believe there is enough information about the deep sea to have a thorough interactive exhibition on it this was the first exhibit we went to and it was sort of a let down while i did learn a lot from reading every single caption and plaque it could have been a lot more exciting the nice thing about the museum is that re entry is allowed between exhibits we went to get lunch at marina bay shoppes literally right next door and came back for dreamworks it was amazing i am still in shock as to how much work is put into a single film you have to see it to believe it this exhibition was nice because it had videos of the producers and artistic directors from each film explaining highlights of the process so you get an in depth look at their work the exhibit does a great job of emphasizing the length and detail of producing an animated film you never even pay attention to the artwork characteristic of a certain film or the orchestral moods in the background but so much creativity and talent and work goes into such things to create a memorable immersive world as you can tell i was tremendously impressed the ticketing lady told us that each exhibit would take  minutes and the art gallery  well we spent an hour and a half in the deep two hours in dreamworks and an hour in the contemporary art gallery plus thirty minutes for lunch sooo yeah very very very impressed you might go when there are different exhibits but i think all of them are worth seeing enjoy,Positive
artscience-museum,free entry for up to  kids on fridays with purchase of minimum  adult ticket great deal we  adults and kids aged  and  thoroughly enjoyed future world and van cleef arpel show the gift shop is fun to browse coloring area for kids and sofa outside restrooms there are benches surrounding a pond on the lg foor good for waiting and some of them near wall power outlets we charged our phones exhibitions aside excellent architecture and surrounding landscape offers beautiful views of the bay there is a mall next door where you can grab a bite gardens by the bay within comfortable walking distance at a casual pace,Positive
artscience-museum,i have lived in singapore for over four years visited many times before and had never made it to this museum did not even know what it was for the longest time i think calling it a museum is a bit inaccurate unless i missed something it is more of a gallery for visiting exhibitions we went for the dreamworks animation exhibit and also got tickets to see the deep and the singapore eye contemporary art exhibit there did not appear to be any permanent museum exhibits that i saw just two galleries downstairs and one upstairs in the lotus flower so writing a review based on the travelling exhibits does not seem fair as they are just visitors so the actual facility is what to review i was pleased with the facility the pricing was very reasonable the facilities were well maintained clean and did not get in the way or hinder the actual exhibitions an unexpected highlight were the upstairs gallery rooms that gave my daughter and her friend a chance to have fun with echos probably not as enjoyable for any others again perhaps i missed something but as an exhibition gallery it was a ok,Negative
artscience-museum,all about the exhibits that are there if your not interested in the exhibit you wo not enjoy it simple i was highly satisfied in the few exhibits i saw here harry potter andy warhol and lego exhibit all three exhibits were fantastic discount if i remember correctly you can show your passport or student id for discount,Positive
artscience-museum,what kind of museum gives you so much free stuff on each admission ticket there s a voucher for one free drink fanta or vitamin water this means if you go to the free hermes exhibition and the deep sea exhibition you get two drinks omg so heavy to carry haha art science is located right next to marina bay sands take the bayfront mrt and just follow the signs the exhibitions rotate out every so and so right now they currently have the deep sea exhibition on preserved animals from the deep sea hermes exhibition on leather goods and purses and living yangtze water sustainability hermes leather forever it is free and on the rd floor okay this exhibition was incredible it showed the whole history of hermes the process of creating the bags and some quirky pieces incredibly fun interactive and innovative there is an exhibit where you can ride a fake horse and compete against a friend this is an exhibit you cannot miss living yangtze sponsored by swavorski shows a photographers journey throughout the yangtze river in china and his photos video documentary you get a gift bag that contains a poster of the river i believe and a magazine at the end i definitely had a fun time exploring here at least check out the free exhibition if you have time,Positive
artscience-museum,came for the crystal universe exhibit everything that i saw was wonderful staff are very nice  entry for non resident student etc which is okay must see while this exhibit is here,Positive
artscience-museum,this museum is shaped like a lotus flower it is gorgeous architecture we spent a little while just admiring everything from outside and taking photos before we went in i had seen signage for the dreamworks exhibit so that was the sole reason we came here i am such a nerd for dreamworks movies kung fu panda is on repeat on my ipad anytime i travel followed by how to train your dragon and shrek it is serious so this exhibit was amazing i was totally bummed that the top floor was closed for a private event so we could not check that part out we also bought tickets for the deep sea exhibit which was totally creepy and awesome the crazy stuff they have for you to see from the deep crevices of the sea is amazing and kind of gross when we purchased our tickets they gave us coupons for free cokes from the gift shop once we finished be warned you cannot have a cold coke from the fridge only the hot ones sitting on the counter all in all we enjoyed the exhibits and walking around the parts of the museum that were open i would come back for the next traveling show,Positive
artscience-museum,in my time in singapore i basked in the beauty of the structure and visited an exhibition the building itself is so recognizable on the bay i kept describing it as a lotus flower but others did not see it for visitors you must not leave until you have snapped a photo as you approach you can sense the grand scale i highly recommend visiting the national geographic  best photographs exhibition for photography lovers this is a must each one of the photos are a cause for multiple minutes of reflection some are recognizable but others are wonderful stories that are lesser known the mini rooms detailing photography techniques composition lighting etc were a great addition as well all in all the museum is a staple of singapore,Positive
artscience-museum,check out the deep exhibition very interesting with the types of fishes that can be found there not cheap for ticket price went when it was free during the sg jubilee weekend crowded but the crowd moved fast,Negative
artscience-museum,art and science may seem at opposite ends of the spectrum but you can find them together at the marina bay sands so earlier this summer i spent an afternoon walking through a world of dinosaurs and then later enjoying the photography of anne leibowitz the dinosaur exhibit would certainly appeal to children the anne leibowitz not so much compared to other dinosaur exhibits i have seen the artscience museum really did a great job in presenting a wide variety much better than the ones i saw in portland and seattle while these museums will not draw you in with a permanent collection but the exhibits here are relevant and will certainly draw an international crowd,Positive
artscience-museum,marina bay sands you either love it or hate it i am more in the latter camp although the artscience museum is brought to us by the same architect who built mbs i will admit that i really like this structure how can you not be inspired by an awesome lotus shaped building i was not sure what to expect from a museum that fused art and science together but once i watched the well put together introduction piece that they present on the top floor i immediately saw how art and science are related it was pretty mind blowing to see how the creations of artists and scientists before us were innovative for their time and why you cannot have science without art and vice versa i decided to check out all of the exhibits but i was only a fan of the art of the brick which showcased artist nathan sawaya is sculptures all made of lego bricks some of the biggest sculptures were built with over   lego bricks so it is definitely a sight to see since i only liked one of the three current exhibits i maintain a  star yelp rating overall hopefully there will be more future exhibits that will interest me so i will have a reason to visit this beautiful building again,Positive
artscience-museum,very nice building inside and out the bulk of the museum seems to be the traveling exhibit at the basement floor the upper levels do not have much i was expecting more in their permanent exhibit upstairs especially for the  foreigner is entrance fee but there really was not much up there it is still a cool museum to check out jonasapproved,Negative
artscience-museum,what a fun museum first of all it looks like a strange claw reaching upwards into the singapore sky down below is the traveling exhibit i saw the dinosaur skeletons there it was perhaps the best such exhibit i have ever seen the skeletons were all illuminated with spotlights from many angles the top floor had a student show from nus the museum itself is small well one of the floors was closed when i went so you wo not get that blurry museum syndrome by visiting,Negative
artscience-museum,interesting design makes you wonder how they actually fit exhibitions into that small space the secret is building downwards the underground section can house a respectable sized exhibition went for the dinosaur and annie lebovitz exhibitions not really a good idea to purchase tickets for both on the same day because they are very different forms of art it saves you cost though love the design of the place,Positive
artscience-museum,i wanted to love this place i really did as a childless lady in my late twenties it just was not enough to justify the expense all access ticket for non resident adults is   if you are a senior or student they had  exhibits one about data one about jewelry and another about i do not really know what it was about but it was the most impressive out of the three they had giant wall to wall screens and projections it was pretty darn impressive but meant to appeal to children there was a room meant to look like space it had strings of lights that changed every so often that was pretty cool i mean if i had a children i would bring them here just to see the looks on their precious faces it is that impressive there is a room with giant lit up balls for kids to play with against the dark background it looks really neat the data exhibit was a snore for me i am from silicon valley so it just did not amuse me at all the jewelry exhibit was interesting but i am not a big fan of jewelry i did enjoy parts of the exhibit for example they showed a sapphire in different forms in jewelry and in it is natural state that was informative they did that for pretty much every gem you can imagine including pearls and other natural resources used in jewelry in this case its just a matter of personal preference i go to museums to learn about things i do not know about i did not learn anything i did not already know,Negative
artscience-museum,right when anything and everything that is related to marina bay sands you really do not expect things to come cheap same goes with artscience museum atas is perhaps the best description for artscience museum with history of bringing in popular exhibitions like the titanic andy warhol and yes wizard boy harry potter no wonder it suddenly becomes museum is cool branding to the locals here yes take that as a good change happening in singapore the exhibitions definitely drove quite a lot of tourist dollars too anyway i have been there a few times and yes i love the place with blasting aircon and walking in a quiet environment i get to appreciate and learn about the exhibition better thank god i have not walked with student groups during my time there for it will spoil my mood oh yes a great place for photography enthusiasts too,Positive
artscience-museum,one of singapore is newest museums artscience claims to blend art and science or something like that and it does have interesting exhibitions i have explored artefacts from titanic examined masterpieces by dali and saw magic in van gogh is paintings it is all brilliant stuff and i cannot wait to see what else the musuem brings the museum has an interesting architecture which resembles an unfolding lotus or a palm it reflects the sun brightly on a hot day and looks dazzling you cannot explore much of the interior without buying a ticket so do consider visiting at least one of the exhibition especially if you wo not be in town for long do check out the museum shop for some interesting stuff on sale,Positive
artscience-museum,the artscience museum brought in several notable exhibitions over the past year from the surreal works of salvador dali vincent van gogh interactive art pieces shipwrecked treasure titanic exhibition to andy warhol and the harry potter exhibition now one thing i like the most are their art exhibitions which are always very well displayed and very well presented they also hold really interesting interactive displays such as andy warhol is factory or the feel of an iceberg the tickets are slightly cheaper for singapore citizens and it is most definitely worth an afternoon spent in the art science museum,Positive
artscience-museum,i really miss this place because it has pure beauty and makes tourists and locals relaxed by all means it is good if you are in the marine parade area so many gorgeous photos the photo major or the photographer will be knocked off they feet when they set foot here it is also very convenient for me because one of the organizations i am party of in singapore has its meetings in marina bay sands and afterwards i go here to savor the sights of art it is really worth it,Positive
artscience-museum,been to two exhibitions and i have to say i am really digging the use of the space it is pretty posh looking as you come in and that is a good start buy your tickets at the counter and they have got plenty of people to help you out so that is nice dont forget to whip out your student id senior citizen card or ns id walk over to the gantry scan your ticket and you get pointed towards a lift and off you go the high ceilings certainly help make the space look grand too both the warhol and the eames exhibitions benefitted from the museum is unique shape and it made a lot of sense to walk in the organised circuit the easy integration of the audio visual element was probably more of a curatorial decision rather than a plus for the museum but i guess it takes two hands to clap and the exhibits were laid out beautifully the staff have been courteous and unobtrusive and made any interaction deliberate and useful which is a nice change from people who yell at you to not touch this or that or are completely uninformed and not helpful architecturally it is a pretty building and not bad looking for something that is fast becoming an icon next to mbs,Positive
artscience-museum,okay museum reviewed eye of singapore exhibits interesting contemporary art items could have some more items in there as there is a lot of wasted floor spsce,Negative
artscience-museum,great exhibitions in a gorgeous building while every exhibition thus far requires a fee it has been worth it i caught andy warhol is exhibition and it was certainly substantial well spaced out and the curation made sense while the retail store did not have very much products there were some good and interesting products that was not just for memory sake the affordable audio guide on an ipod is a big plus so people do not have to crowd around to read about a displayed item art at any one time,Positive
artscience-museum,awesome architecture in the form of a lotus start by going up then go down to main halls depends on the exhibits in season currently is harry potter which is really amazing if you are a fan there is also a souvenir shop at the basement level,Positive
artscience-museum,not too long ago i visited the andy warhol and harry potter exhibitions at this museum while it was interesting to see actual costumes and props from the harry potter movies i expected things to be more interactive and magical if you do not remember any of the artefacts there are tv monitors screening movie clips where these items appeared before i knew it i was done touring the entire harry potter exhibition be selective if you are planning to buy souvenirs because the merchandise at the souvenir shop are pricey i am sure the diehard fans would still fork out the money the andy warhol exhibition was full of fushcia silver i am not that artsy fartsy and i did not understand what was going on in the andy warhol exhibition nevertheless i do like the contemporary ambience in the artscience museum will most certainly be back for other exhibitions,Negative
artscience-museum,we had always been enthralled by the unusual structure of the artscience museum and when it finally opened we wasted no time in checking out the then salvador dali and vincent van gogh exhibition the former was pretty well executed good collection of salvador dali is sculptures the latter was a bit of a let down with mere projections of his paintings on the walls recently we had a chance to head down again for the andy warhol and harry potter exhibitions and thoroughly enjoyed them both it was interesting seeing the different costumes props and sets for the harry potter movies and we thought the andy warhol exhibits showed some interesting pieces we had never seen before good job,Positive
artscience-museum,when artscience museum was in the midst of construction i often wondered what was that exploded football beneath marina bay sands mbs later on it grew into a lotus and i finally read in the papers that it is the artscience museum i like the fact that it is the artscience museum aiming to bring to singapore the creative products of art science design and technology among other things to the un erm cultured people like me we are glad to have something beyond history and heritage till date it has held very crowd pleasing exhibitions such as harry potter and titanic the set ups were pretty good i particularly like how they tried to replicate the deck is starry night onboard the titanic the one on andy warhol was as quirky as what the man was and i was tickled by the huge words lining the top of the wall quoting warhol that it would be glamorous to be reincarnated as a great big ring on elizabeth taylor is finger through mbs it is accessible from bayfront station do note that when it rains be prepared to either run or get an umbrella as the short pathway at the top en route to artscience is unsheltered,Positive
artscience-museum,just like everything else at marina bay sands the artscience museum has such a contemporary and slightly futuristic appeal to it with intricate architecture it is apparent that artscience aims to bring forth a culture of design and arts to both locals as well as foreigners the museum itself is pretty huge even the lifts are massive and can probably fit up to twenty people staff members here are amiable and really helpful immediately going to your aid the moment your face reflects an ounce of confusion i recently visited the museum for both the andy warhol and harry potter exhibitions the harry potter exhibition was a bit of a letdown because i expected a lot more than just costumes and outfits no matter how spectacular they really were the whole exhibition felt a little short lived although i tried my best to keep reading almost every little fact about the displayed items i also assumed that since many kids were fans of harry potter there would be slightly more interactive games and such well at least a buckbeak replica graced the hagrid section the andy warhol exhibition on the other hand was rather terrific as it truly showcased warhol is eccentric and bizarre disposition i think i must have spent the entire evening there observing warhol is paintings and novelties they even had a replica of warhol is studio called the factory i am definitely coming back here for more exhibitions,Positive
artscience-museum,building is dramatic and ambitious architecturally and well worth the price of admission this is a totally subjective comment disclaimer but i was pretty underwhelmed by the photography it is disappointing when the best part of a museum is the building itself,Positive
national-orchid-garden,located within the singapore botanic gardens the national orchid garden is definitely worth a visit for some fresh air in tourist friendly surroundings outside the main entrance is a gift shop a snack beverage kiosk and plenty of benches once inside there are beautiful orchids of different colors all over the place the entire grounds are well maintained and pleasant on the eyes most importantly despite the singapore heat and humidity i did not see any insects bugs roaming around the grounds so definitely some magic at work by the groundskeepers fellow tourists were wondering why there were not any bugs either the entire place never felt crowded as other local attractions tend to be all in all this was definitely a great fresh air outing for me and certainly a place in singapore that i would recommend to visitors,Positive
national-orchid-garden,if you like orchids this place will be your favorite botanical garden in the world when you go into the garden you will pay a few extra dollars to enter the orchid area however it is worth it there is rows upon rows of all types and colors of orchids along with artful designs there is a little bit of climbing involved and a few different paths with arches and tall structures filled with orchids the placement of them is very artistic further up is a building with some special orchids named after political dignitaries except to spend at least an hour or more if you want to take more photos they have a fairly nice gift shop that sells some orchid designed items to take home it can get pretty hot and there is not many shady areas so remember to bring some sunscreen and or a hat it is fairly humid so you will want to bring some water too,Positive
national-orchid-garden,when you visit the singapore botanic garden you gotta make your way in to the national orchid garden how can you not for  admission it is the only garden with an admission fee but it was incredibly organized well maintained and in full bloom with vibrant flora orchids back home got nothing on these the variations were stunning and there were different sections like the greenhouse and cool house that allowed for these plants to flourish honestly the cool house was the best part of the path situated toward the middle it was the best resting place with sinapore is humidity as a tourist that heat was something i could not get used to haha i probably spent at least two hours in the garden the flora was admirable stunning and unique in their own way from petal shape to the patterns colors they exhibit i am sure i snapped like  photos of the garden alone ridiculous but i got to see things i have never seen before and things i may never see again haha trust me it is worth taking a look and before you leave pick up a ginger refreshment near the ginger garden if you love ginger you wo not want to miss that,Negative
national-orchid-garden,definitely worth the  entrance fee the orchids are breathtaking and there is an incredible variety the best part is the bird cage that is full of orchids this was one of my favorite parts of my visit to singapore tip if you have a student id make sure to bring it to get the discounted price of just,Positive
national-orchid-garden,i loved all of the orchids but my favorite were the ones named after famous people like princess diana some of the orchids are absolutely exotic and rare this garden will keep you enthused and lost with love over orchids you can tell that this place is very well maintained just make sure to pack some water because it is pretty pricey in the garden and with the insane humidity you will need water,Positive
national-orchid-garden,review  singapore review  in my humble opinion if you are in singapore and have any interest in flora or fauna one absolute must is a visit to the national orchid garden yelp com bizphotos nati it is located within the singapore botanic gardens by the way this is the only botanical gardens in the world open from  am to midnight and free every day of the year the national orchid garden is open from   am to  pm and entry is just  singapore about   us which is so worth it there are   orchid plants  different species about  species on display and more than   hybrids these orchids range from the very small yelp com bizphotos nati to the very large these are over  inches across yelp com bizphotos nati so many interesting varieties with stunning colors yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati some with spots stripes and unique coloring yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati there are a number of varieties named after famous people as well this one is the margaret thatcher perhaps because it looks old and shriveled up lol yelp com bizphotos nati so many bright colors yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati you can easily spend a half day wandering around looking at everything so plan accordingly i took  photos and could have easily taken  more but my camera battery died dammit one thing that gave us a nice break from the heat humidity was the cool house a very large glass enclosure that was wonderfully cool and tropical inside overall i was truly amazed as i never knew so many different sizes shapes and colors of orchids ever existed highly recommend,Positive
national-orchid-garden,definitely my favorite spot in singapore the singapore botanic garden is huge and there is so much to see you could easily pack a nice picnic lunch and spend your entire day there the park itself is free but there is a nominal sg  fee to get into the national orchid garden and it is absolutely worth it orchids are my favorite flower so seeing all the different types in various shapes colors and patterns all in one place is just fabulous plus the garden has designated photo spots for you to take the best pictures with the most beautiful backgrounds it took us maybe   hours to walk through the orchid garden alone quite spacious and beautifully laid out word of advice make sure to bring an umbrella just in case we were there at the end of monsoon season in november and we were caught in a torrential downpour if it were not for our umbrellas we would have soaked through must visit if you are in singapore,Positive
national-orchid-garden,it was a gorgeous place and i kept thinking that i would stop feeling impressed as we went further but it never happened it was a great place and i took a ton of photos remember to bring sunblock or a hat and definitely bring bug spray if you are susceptible to bug bites it is in the middle of the gardens free entry to the main gardens but you have to pay to come into the orchid gardens the gift shop is air conditioned which meant i lingered and ended up buying a small souvenir singapore is known for gold coated orchids and this is a place where you certainly can find them although possibly cheaper at other places i found myself wishing i lived closer and could buy some of the tiny live orchid plants which we thought were a good price at around  us,Positive
national-orchid-garden,if you are visiting the singapore botanical garden free the extra admission fee s  to see the orchid garden is definitely worth it it is truly beautiful and wonderfully curated,Positive
national-orchid-garden,this garden is amazing there were so many unique orchids and it was larger than i expected very fun place to explore,Positive
national-orchid-garden,i am not sure why everyone raves about this place it is just like any other well manicured flower garden that i have visited as a plus singapore is humidity and constant rainfall facilitate the great growth of wonderful colorful orchids throughout this garden so i thought that i might as well take a look being a student i only had to pay sg  for entry so i was already excited there are signs throughout the garden that say photo spot and there is a funny area where orchids are named after famous international celebrities such as shah rukh khan because they have visited the garden after a while the same view got a little monotonous so my  friends and i decided to leave all in all it was worth the dollar that i paid note i am a nature person so i do appreciate a great flower in bloom,Positive
national-orchid-garden,we went here last year at it was fantastic kyla pangcoga,Positive
national-orchid-garden,well i was not expecting this after having lunch at nearby halia my companion could not stick around with me afterwards but did recommend that i check out the national orchid garden for a minimal fee of  i figured oh what the hell and decided to check it out i am not a flower person but oh sweet jesus this garden blew me away the landscaping and design is really something to admire viewing something like this in the us would probably cost you a  admission fee at least if you are pressed for time or if you are like my husband then i highly recommend visiting the mist house this is where they house all of the rare orchids the colors are bold and vibrant and you cannot help but be all whooaaaaaa and sweeeeeeeet and shit balls this is awesooooooome if you are tired of feeling sticky thanks to the  outdoor humidity chill out the cool house which simulates the rainforests that are located at higher elevations i actually did not find this at all interesting but it was a nice respite from the humidity this garden is definitely on the top of my list for must see singapore attractions after all it is the largest display of tropical orchids in the world who would want to miss that bring your camera and enjoy my husband meaning you might have add you do not really care about details and you like to rush through sightseeing tours say that you have been there done that and move on ugh men,Negative
national-orchid-garden,this garden is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful the botanic garden is free but this section has a  admission fee and it is totally worth it the garden is quaint and small they sectioned the garden into little zones vip zone celebrity zone award winning zone etc theres a fair amount of shade to keep the walk pleasant and enjoyable,Positive
national-orchid-garden,if you love flowers then you will have an absolute organsim in this place because this entire garden is made up entirely of flowers to be precise orchids i have never seen so many flowers in my entire life okay it is a part of the singapore botanic gardens but the fact that yelp and other websites list this seperately goes to show how amazing and mind boggling beautiful this place actually is if you are in singapore for a couple of days and you do not go here then you are seriously missing out on one of the most beautiful artificial places in the world and i do say one because there are others that i have been too even though i am nowhere near an expert on international travel than some people are here you will find flowers flowers and even more flowers okay they are all orchids but does that matter when all you are wanting to look at are flowers in fact i never realised that you could do so much with a single species of plant until i came here all i can say is that this place is absolutely amazing,Positive
national-orchid-garden,i love the national orchid garden as literally an urban refuge i think it is one of the few places in the botanic gardens where you do not hear a children and b the road it is a gorgeous part of the central core which means that you have to walk a bit but it also means that you are near symphony lake and halia it is not a garden more like gardens there is burkhill hall which is also a spot you can hire for parties and weddings nestled amongst orchids named for various leaders celebrities etc there is the mist house and the cool house and various collections of rare and exotic plants you could spend an entire day there plenty of shade and seating if you planned ahead and brought in your own sandwiches and drinks because the only refreshments available in the orchid garden itself come from a vending machine and frankly i am not impressed by the refreshment stand just opposite for those of us who love photography of persons not flowers the national orchid garden has marked out photo spots there is the golden cage the orchid grotto etc etc so perhaps the only pain you may face if you are not a misanthrope like me is when you have to wait for someone to finish posing before you can take your turn some details to note the garden closes at pm which means that the last ticket is sold at pm tickets are  for adults  for senior citizens  and up and students and free for tots below  i believe that they have some free entry days during the vacation period so just check out the website to be sure,Positive
national-orchid-garden,the national orchid garden has a huge range of orchids on display although i am not a big fan of plants flowers i did enjoy looking at the hundreds of orchids on display and marvelled at how gorgeous they were especially after hearing how difficult they are to cultivate and grow to deal with singapore is somewhat punishing humidity and heat there is an air conditioned area displaying what i can only guess to be orchids that do not survive well in the heat i must confess i spent a fair amount of time in that arena pa cute touch was designated photo spots around the garden with wooden benches and orchids framed around it for a good photo,Negative
national-orchid-garden,this is the most gorgeous place in singapore and one of the cheapest pleasures you can get in this city from the moment you step into the orchid garden it is like you enter another world an oasis in a city like singapore where it seems like malling is the only thing there is left to do this is another world no yelling people no bright bling bling and no smell of food left and right sometimes it is just worth to go back to the roots and enjoy mother nature i remember when i first visited singapore  this was the first thing i visited and i was and still am in awe about it come and see for yourself s,Positive
national-orchid-garden,came here as part of a family trip with people of all ages  to  and interests and everyone thought it was gorgeous tip bring your student id for a cheaper entrance ticket  singapore dollar otherwise pay the  singapore dollars to get entrance this is definitely one of the places in singapore where your buck gets you a lot of bang it is a beautiful oasis like stepping into a secret fairy garden with giant birdcages lillypad ponds streaming fountains and every variation of orchid you could imagine i was skeptical at first but found it totally worth it to leave a few hours to stroll through just the orchid part of the botanical gardens did not even touch the other parts even given the   a day i spent there i felt rushed to get through it all my favorite parts were the giant birdcage and the cool house imagine walking into a manmade rainforest with a waterfall and all inside the most air conditioned building on the grounds heaven this place just teems with beauty and nature and you cannot help but admire it all definitely recommended as part of your visit to singapore you wo not be disappointed,Positive
national-orchid-garden,so i love a decent walk and i can tell a pretty flower when i see one the combination of taking a nice stroll and taking in some ridiculously beautiful flowers all at a cost of just  student discount was such a wonderful way to spend the hour i was not expecting much of this place i thought just how big a deal can they make out of one silly flower a pretty darn big deal i never realised how many different species of orchids there were some     if i recall correctly nor did i realise just how big and mazy the botanic gardens was just where have we found all this land the orchird gardens was not just one roundabout but an island tour of sorts taking you through the vip section where flowers are named after several important people the mist room where you will find some crazy beautiful looking ones and the very appealing cool room where you can set your eyes on some carnivorous plants and walk through a wall of mist my adventure ended there because i thought that an hour was all we needed so that was all i put for my coupon parking along tyersall ave but the next time i am back and i will be back i am going for the long haul because there was still so much more to explore,Negative
national-orchid-garden,for  per person i really enjoyed my day when i brought a friend from myanmar here to visit we had a ball of a time as she is really into nature and flowers and even the urbanite in me who prefers bustling nights and cities loved that there is some place like this i can find solace in if i want and right around the corner from town too orchids of all shapes sizes and colours greeted us every corner we turned and we got trigger happy she returned home with  photos from the orchid garden i have always dissed our local attractions but there is a real gem in this one burkill hall is also really beautiful and i have recently been invited to a wedding there really looking forward to visiting again,Positive
national-orchid-garden,yes there is something to do besides eat and shop in singapore this is an excellent garden within a garden which houses a variety of different orchids take a stroll and bring a cold drink or two as you might pass out from the humidity of note it seems like a royal pain in the butt to grab a taxi after a visit,Positive
national-orchid-garden,i had never been to the orchid garden growing up in the s in singapore i did not visit the garden when i would come back for a visit while living in the states i have now relocated back and my friend came to visit me so i made a list of places for her to see in singapore this was on the list we were both transported to an orchid world of beautiful exotic flowers and lush greenery i took so many pictures and so did my friend this is definitely a good place to visit when you want to be in awe of nature and take a visitor from out of town,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,i love chicken rice and this chain just does it so well this location in particular keeps things moving despite being deluged with many customers who like myself want some delicious hainanese chicken rice and the accoutrements that go along with it,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,came by for dinner the other night and it was a tasty experience thank you to yelper nik t for all the fantastic photos and review located in the novena area the restaurant itself features air conditioning the trickiest part is the service is rather mediocre started off with the daily soup and it was a soothing and refreshing way to start off dinner after a long day of traveling the kang kong belanchan was excellent with strong flavors and young vegetables portions were small which was perfect the   roast chicken was the highlight of the meal with fresh chicken roasted perfectly and super juicy the ginger onion dipping sauce was delightful too the noodles were a nice way to complement the meal too  head after tax and  service charge,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,i would come back here every week if i can afford roundtrip airfare is from the us to here lol it is a good indoor space with ac to have a nice and quick lunch or dinner if you are in town and think outside is too hot or humid salt and pepper crabgreat flavor to the pepper sauce i have had this dish three times in singapore and their sauce is possibly the best word of caution this is a messy dish there is no good way to eat this your fingers are going to get dirty and sticky so just dive in and take care of business the quality of the crab was three star it felt a little undersized given the price paid i will give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt because it is late in crab season and i have been spoiled by the dungeness living in san francisco salty egg prawn with golden mini bunomg this is so delicious a bit sweet and tiny salty it is perfect sauce for the mini bunhai nun white chicken ricemy all time favorite singapore classic dish you can use garlic and spicy sauce from the table there are many famous rice chicken restaurants in singapore but this is definitely one of the best green vegetables stir fried with shrimp paste it is a bit salty but it tastes really good with ricebeef her fen very tender beef with white width rice flat noodles if you like rice flat noodles  and beef you will definitely like it there are few boba milk tea black sugar caramel is my favorite and dessert place that is right outside of the restaurant good way to end the meal for sure,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,hainanese chicken rice is a national dish and one of those things you have to have when you visit singapore one spot consistently appears on all of the major lists and reviews to find it wee nam kee do not let its multiple locations make it appear like a chain and touristy it is serving up some pretty damn good bites and worth a visit while i am no expert on another countries national dish it was pretty good in my book and i would go back for more the chicken was beautifully cooked and the meat moist through it all and its simple flavors were quickly brought out by the fragrant rice filled with ginger and spice from garlic add the soy or chili flavored sauces on the side to your liking and your set the roast meats that you can order were not too shabby and the sauted vegetables were pretty delicious but not worth a  hour flight for service is quick and efficient while the line does add a bit of a wait time it moves at a decent pace prices are pretty reasonable so you could enjoy a few dishes to share the ambiance is simple and loud so probably not the best for that high level dinner meeting or that romantic special evening in a city filled with so many options would i go back heck yeah it was pretty good and i know i wo not be disappointed,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,nd greatest place in singapore for roasted hainan chicken the poached steamed soya hainan chicken is below average very long wait time poor service from badly understaffed crew dumpling is horrendous tze char here is bad,Negative
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,singapore is national dish is hainanese chicken rice and one of those things you have to have when you visit singapore business lunch and wanted local food so wee nam kee it was and i was quite happy the consistent good reviews are for a very good reason the food is good you get a lot and service is great i recommend the boiled white chicken the chicken was expertly cooked and the meat moist with a simple flavor that is enhanced by the fragrant rice that has ginger and garlic mix the ginger soy or chili flavored sauces that are on the table for different flavors,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,the best chicken rice i have ever had in my entire life go with the steamed chicken although the roast chicken comes quite close also get the kangkung with some sort of balachan sauce as your veggies the salted egg yolk ribs are also bomb,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,the roast pork did not taste super fresh and the char siu skin was not that crispy the hainanese chicken was fairly standard and the shark fin soup was okay,Negative
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,if my latest check in says i have been here x then i have to give this place  stars i am no chicken rice expert although i have eaten my fair share of them in my few months here in sg the reason i keep returning to wnk as my favorite chxn rice place is simply because it is so delicious the roast chicken is my favorite because of the nice skin and tender meat pieces i also prefer that my ginger and chili pastes are separated in separate containers like it is here i like to make my own concoction wnk is a well established restaurant and clientele will continue to flock here for their hainanese dishes i was amazed to find out that the founder of wnk does not even cook at all great story great food,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,i wonder why this place is so famous the chicken is pretty good but not the best singapore can produce and the rice is not very fragrant and just average other dishes we had tofu salted egg prawns kang kong were quite meh,Negative
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,get the white chicken version that is their speciality the sambal version gang kung is good side dish i would skip the fried dish,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,i went to their katong i branch and i was blown away before wee nam kee i frequently visited another restaurant in the area i did not find their rice to my liking but wee nam kee has great rice as well as great chicken i particularly like the roasted chicken and one of their tofu dish,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,i love this restaurant the hainan chicken rice is so good i ordered the soya sauce roast steamed chicken bbq pork and roast pork taste really good the oyster sauce vegetables is also good conclusion recommended,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,it was quite a long wait for the chicken and after trying it out i would say it is pretty good but not enough to blow me away for anyone visiting singapore you must try the hainan chicken rice the fragrant rice is my favorite part i ate  servings myself and i am also a big fan of adding lots of dark soy sauce to the chicken you should also order the sambal vegetables which is amazing i honestly thought the vegetables were more yummy than the chicken itself to complete the meal you should also order the soup of the day with it,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,my friend took me to try to famous chicken rice near her office we got there early before the lunch time rush definitely a good call to go early since she was in a rush to return to work the line started to form after noon but we were seated slightly before the rush keep in mind that they leave wet naps on the table which will be added to the bill if you use them the chicken rice was amazing and it came with soup on the side we also ordered some veggies bbq pork and roasted pork the chicken was the highlight of the meal and the prices were reasonable the pork was not outstanding since i have had better elsewhere the portions were average but it is great that you are not stuffed by the end of the meal service was similar to a food court as they moved from one into their own location i do crave the tender chicken and will come back if i have the chance to return to singapore,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,chicken and rice makes life finger lickin nice wee nam kee is among my top chicken and rice places in singapore in part because it is just a great gathering place for friends and family members the service is quick and efficient and importantly the chicken and rice and sauce are quite consistently good the chicken is tender and juicy and the rice perfectly captures the chicken juices,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,i love the roast chicken here juicy meat and crispy skin and its condiments chili ginger and dark soy sauce the soup is tasty none of those watered down liquid other places called it as soup the rice could be better but is good enough for me especially when you put everything together in one mouthful it blends beautifully without distractions the dumpling was not bad but not the star i would have to try the noodle version as recommended by the king of singapore aka nik t some day the place is very noisy and if you are prone to headache you may want to get it to go instead the service is very brusque and efficient and one does not really linger over the meal,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,singapore is a culinary paradise and hainanese chicken rice is one of its gems if you have ever come across the cnn go world is  most delicious food you will see this traditional dish stands confidently at number  thus there is no reason to skip it while we were in singapore wee nam kee hainanese chicken rice restaurant was our pick the place is located on thomson road in the novena area we have heard many good stories about this place and the experience turned out to be great when it comes to chicken rice in singapore steamed and roasted chickens are among the top at wee nam kee the chicken is super tender and lean it was cooked beautifully so delicious that you can taste the moist and juicy meat on your first bite do not forget to make yourself the perfect dipping sauce to have the greatest flavor experience combining chili sauce ginger paste and low sodium dark soy sauce you will make up a perfect condiment to go with this dish eating companion is a bowl of fluffy rice which boosts your appetite at an instant more importantly a meal for two will cost you anywhere from s  to s  which is a superb price tag recommendation roasted and steamed chicken rice soy sauce chicken riceread our singapore food guide thecoupleeats com singap,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,review for nov very popular spot around the dinner hour make sure to call ahead for reservations or get take out definitely super delicious and would come here multiple times,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,delicious this places was kind of hard to find i got the half chicken with all three flavors steam soyo and roasted their ginger garlic and hot sauce was super duper bomb their chicken was moist and delicious must know they charge for napkins even the wet napkins they give you when you seat they do not tell you until you open it and they will automatically put it on your tab i felt like this was a scam i never asked for wet napkins and they dare to charge it was only cents but considering their inconsiderate action kind of got me upset other than that their food wasss good,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,died and gone to heaven best chicken and rice i have ever had roasted chicken dipped in chili and dark soy sauce bbq crispy pork out of this world,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,per locals recommendation it was definitely on the list of places to try hainanese chicken rice we were lucky and a table was just leaving when we arrived so no long queue i would say our meal was really good the chicken is moist and flavorful and the rice is just as tasty we ordered half a steamed chicken and extra sauce yum cereal prawns was also something we ordered that i have never tried before and i found it to be the balance of crunchy sweet and then savory they made it pretty well we also got some local veggies and a hot plate dish of veggies shrimp and tofu roast chicken was yummy too overall i would recommend wee nam kee and would come back to this location tip it gets busy so get there early so you do not have to queue too long,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,really solid and good chicken rice soup boiled chicken and roasted pork dining tip add a bit of ginger to the soup it will give a bit more dimension to it,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,if there were some alternate universe where all there was to eat was chicken rice i think i would be okay with that i mean assuming that there were a number of different places to eat said chicken rice i feel like the basic chicken rice broth combo could be varied enough with the additional sauces and condiments to create enough excitement in my mouth and let is assume i could only eat chicken rice in singapore forever and ever it is safe to assume that i would be here at wee nam kee at least  out of  nights stuffing their delectable fowl in my mouth either the steamed or the roasted variety i would not be all that fussy,Negative
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,definitely get here before  and you will find a seat when lunch time hits there will be a wait i ordered the white boiled chicken rice and my sister got the dumpling soup and dry noodles the chicken rice was good although my favorite will always be boon tong kee but the dumpling and noodles was surprisingly delicious,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,so just what goes into the sauce that drenches wee nam kee is noodles is it just a simple combo of sweet yet savoury flavours that keeps me coming back for more or does it contain any extract similar to the secret recipe of coca cola i have been hooked on coke for a good part of my life but am happy to say i am coke free for a good  years plus now ever since a life changing event that culminated in a switch to drinking alkaline water but ever since wee nam kee moved to it is new location at united square which by the way is fully air conditioned better organized but most importantly easier for me to get to i have been hooked on the sauce that drenches their noodles it probably is this same sauce that they use to season their soya sauce chicken but my personal preference has and always will be their legendary crispy skin roast chicken their technique has been perfected such that the crispy skin is indeed crispy whilst the integrity of the succulent flesh beneath is never compromised a whole roast chicken is what i would order and devour do pair that with the sauce that drenches a simple plate of al dente noodles i would instead of their rice the rice from another kee also near me is better in my humble opinion alas the said sauce that drenches their noodles will keep you asking for more noodles just so you can drink more sauce sauce is it the only reason they do not get the fifth star is their poor service it was the same back at novena ville and some things never change not quite sure if they are short handed not quite sure if they are poorly trained you can wait for long periods after being seated desperately waving but all in vain is service with a smile really banned perhaps the best way for you to get your wnk fix is to order to go no queuing just walk up to the counter order pay and go during peak hours even more so a check on their website reveals delivery and catering also hmmmm perhaps mr wee himself will bring me the sauce that drenches the noodles,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,hands down the best chicken rice in singapore as i said in my previous wee nam kee review for the old location i like to get the quarter chicken rice instead of the standard plate of chicken rice when i eat there for some extra chicken along with the wanton soup and sambal kang kong this combination makes for the perfect meal and if you have never had chicken rice before the condiments make the meal yes all three the chill sauce ginger and the black sauce i know a lot of people like tian tian and all the other famous places as well but in my opinion chicken rice really does not get much better than at wee nam kee this place does get crowded though be prepared to fight for a seat during lunch dinner rush hour apart from their chicken rice i die for the salted fish fried rice here too not that you normally would think of ordering anything else but everything else is surprisingly good too since they have moved to united square as expected prices have definitely gone up however for the same great food air con i am not complaining i am just happy the food quality remained the same,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,came here during lunch hours no wait if we wanted to share a table which was no problem with us the chicken and rice was very good would go back just for that having ac helps,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,my fav place to steamed chicken and you tiao to complete my meal i usually ordered hot barley drinks you will not be able to go wrong with this combination cos this place is always packed it would be easier to come in small groups even when you come in a small group  or  people be prepared to share a table with strangers this place is really popular among locals,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,our favourite chicken rice they are pretty good for take out as well the rice is very fragrant and the chicken is very tender and tasty i especially like the roasted chicken we would also typically get the tou miao to go with the meal i have to say the chili sauce and the ginger is what makes this a great plate of food,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,i used to not like chicken rice until i met and married a singaporean pthis is one of my favorite chicken rice places in singapore and i would highly recommend getting the roast chicken if they have it and a side of vegetable i would also recommend eating it if you take away they will often forget your vegetable dish or side dish or whatever you ordered because it is happened to my mother in law and brother in law numerous times if you do takeaway they usually rush you because it is so busy but i would make sure you check all the food items in your bag to make sure they do not forget to give you all your food,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,who knew such a simple dish as chicken rice could be so good and you know what very few if any do it better than wee nam kee wee nam is chicken rice comes in two distinct forms steamed or roasted wee nam is speciality is undoubtedly the roasted chicken rice i prefer dark meat so i usually order the drumstick rice regardless of your order whether the regular chicken rice or drumstick rice you are in for a treat the roasted chicken rice delivers a crunchy skin but yet is soo juicy on the inside the flavours of the chicken just seem to secrete out of the skin these chicken flavours are so good that i do not even bother to use chilli sauce or the sweetish dark sauce that normally accompanies singapore chicken rice dishes the cilantro sprinkled on top is just heavenly i have tried three wee nam kee locations and the one in united square is clearly the best i am not sure if it is the original but it is just that much better service is suspect but then again one does not go to wee nam for the service but rather for the food fair warning any dish outside of chicken rice could take a while to serve the bottom line wee nam delivers a killer roasted chicken rice if you prefer steamed chicken rice tian tian still reigns supreme in my book the united square branch is the crown jewel of the wee nam kee franchise,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,oh my goodness wee nam kee chicken rice restaurant is a solid four stars first let me say this place is always packed a very good sign so get there early or prepare to wait lucky for us we got to the restaurant before the crazy dinner rush and were quickly shown to a table ten minutes later there were no open tables upon seating us in the air conditioned dining room the waitress brought water then started us off with an amazing broth good thing because both of us were starved we slurped it down pretty fast and to our amazement she came over and refilled our bowls very cool since it was just two of us we kept it simple we ordered of course the chicken rice but the baked version it was perfectly prepared moist on the inside crispy skin on top plus a large helping of lightly flavored rice it is easily my top five chicken rice in singapore the other dish was the venison amazing amazing i do not know which chef whipped up this dish but i wish i could hug him brilliant five f ing stars for the venison next time i visit this restaurant my plan is to order an extra venison to go so i can lick the plate when i am done it is that good trust,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,good chicken rice probably my second favorite chicken rice place in singapore it also offers other dishes so you can have more than chicken rice for your meal they accept credit card if your bill exceeds its minimum amount for payments in credit card,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,wee nam kee is the one chicken rice place that when i say it is one of my faves the locals tend to agree with me or at least give a slight nod of approval as opposed to a judge y look and an emphatic how i know you on weekends the queue for this place is crazy but weeknight dinners are manageable some complain it is a bit pricey for chicken rice but in my opinion it is still pretty affordable considering it is air conditioned i have tried both their steamed boiled chicken and their roasted chicken if you have seen me on talk answering questions about chicken rice and local cuisine you will know which one i would almost marry whispers it is the roasted one after a year and a half on the island i am surprised at how i am starting to notice the difference between everyone is recipes i think wee nam kee has the best chicken but i stand by boon tong kee is rice as the more flavorful and fragrant contender i am a bit wary of recommending this place for someone who is never tried chicken rice as i am unsure if they would appreciate or enjoy it as much plus there are no ang mo celebrity chef endorsements here p this is a great location in novena however you can also check out their other outlet in marina square if you cannot venture too far from cbd,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,love the chicken rice here i like the steam one better though the roasted one is also good their hainam rice is always be my fav the taste is rich though if i may suggest they should choose a better type or rice to make it perfect tio miau dunno how to spell it is also one of my favorite their price is like a hawker price with a very nice food a bit noisy though would be good if they can do something to reduce the noise,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,prettt overrated the only reason i will come here and eat is because it is near my house and whenever i am too lazy to travel this is the go to place for chicken rice however highly recommend whoever wants to enjoy a decent plate of chicken rice please go to tian tian at maxwell by far the best in singapore,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,singaporeans are very passionate about their chicken rice it is almost as difficult in trying to get a consensus when asking chicagoans where to find the best deep dish pizza in the city everyone has their favorite chicken rice wee nam kee is one the popular choices for chicken rice in singapore we order half a chicken and the meat is tender the skin over the pieces of chicken is smooth but without the gelatinous layer under the skin like at tian tian at wee nam kee the chicken sits on a layer of sweet savory soy sauce that is very tasty at tian tian a golden glaze is used instead when it comes to choosing a personal favorite establishment for chicken rice it is more than the chicken itself that come into consideration the accompanying rice chilli sauce and ginger sauce are as important and they complete the chicken rice experience the gold standard of rice that is part of the chicken rice experience should be fragrant traditionally uncooked rice is fried with chicken fat before the rice is placed in the rice cooker at wee nam kee the rice is almost reminiscent of brown rice and there is a lack of fragrance though the chilli and ginger sauce are a little better than just good overall the chicken chilli sauce and ginger sauce are pretty good but the rice does not stand out here if you want to have more than chicken rice the kitchen here prepares other itmes such as deep fried stuffed tofu and stir fried venison with ginger and scallions,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,move over tian tian i never liked tian tian despite all the ravings and international recognition and good chicken rice like how i remembered it to be is a hard thing to find these days wnk is how it should be go for the roast chicken it is amazing succulent and juicy with the perfect roasted skin that makes you want to lick the plate so good that we ended up ordering another drumstick rice is fluffy and flavorful and i also liked that their chilli is spicier than the usual places which seems to be toning down the flavor to suit western palate and they still serve it with the best kind of dark soy sauce silky thick not too salty takes forever to pour out of the bottle yeah thanks to the yelp singapore king i saved half of my carb stomach for their  plain noodles it is a simple plate of goodness it may be better in the old days but for now this one still totally hits the spot,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,this is one of the best roasted chicken rice i have ever tasted the meat is always well cooked it does not have the disgusting raw chicken taste that some chicken rice have the skin is well roasted just the way i like it the price is cheap as well the only thing i do not like is the ambiance is always crowded and noisy during lunch time the staff makes half of the noise banging plates and utensils everywhere the other half is made by the customers raising their voices trying to be heard by their friends and colleagues who are just across their table once you get past that then nothing is stopping you from enjoying your delicious chicken rice,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,this is a classic i have never been disappointed one of the better chicken rice joints of singapore that have not only maintained the taste but also the service cost wise basic restaurant prices be prepared to pay about  for  pax a must try place for every tourist,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,although they do chicken rice very well go for the fried chicken i love the food they cook in the kitchen their sambal kangkong is one of the best i also like their teochew style steamed fish and salty vegetable soup i go to singapore every year and i try to come here once,Positive
wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice,pretty nice place for chicken rice but i guess this is due to the competition for chicken rice on that  corner across the novena mrt ordered the hainan rice with roast bbq pork since i do not feel like eating chicken the rice is fragrant and tasty but the pork is not that great too dry i guess i should have stayed with the restaurant name and ordered chicken,Negative
atlas,beautiful absolutely stunning interior go for the beauty and a cocktail skip the afternoon tea the afternoon tea was not bad but was not something we left raving about we do afternoon tea on most of our trips and this was probably our least favorite the food was just ok the cocktails were top notch order the atlas orange gin and tonic,Negative
atlas,bruce wayne approved this gloriously opulent art deco styled bar luxuriously appointed with vaulted mural ceilings is located in the ground floor of a gotham city inspired skyscraper named after the greek titans of endurance bearing the mirror sheened atlas stone in front of the entrance you will be pleasantly surprised as you enter and take in the optics of this stunningly designed wonder the best seating is at the bar where you can banter with the bartenders and be baffled by their bottlework or just stare at the bottles whatever takes your fancy i have had negroni old fashioned and gin tonic here and they are all exceptional executions of classic cocktails warning  there is a  gin tonic on the menu be careful you do not order that unless you really mean to order that warning  the beetroot chips are seriously addictive and whenever you get low they will refill these and you may lose track of just how many you have you have been warned warning  the cocktails are well balanced but boozy meaning you wo not be able to tell they have a whack in them when you stand up you may find yourself wobblier than a busted bike wheel so please do attempt to retain your dignity by walking slowly towards the exit highly recommended for the gin fanatics out there they currently have the world is largest hand curated collection of gin consisting of over   bottles,Positive
atlas,what an awesome art deco bar it is very breathtaking the first time you see it the drinks are well crafted albeit they wo not be cheap   sgd it can be busy during happy hours but the wait should be brief it will be worth the experience one note there is a dress code you cannot enter with shorts sandals,Positive
atlas,i knew from the photos that it was a beautiful bar but i am pleased to announce that the drinks are of equal quality the transatlantic really stood out as one of the most memorable drinks i had in singapore between the fresh apple juice and wasabi oil it was just unlike any drink i have ever had before interesting flavors and perfectly balanced the staff was really friendly and by the way they talked to some of the other guests at the bar i get the sense they have their share of regulars a very memorable experience in the haze of my singapore bar crawl,Positive
atlas,it is on the top  best bars list and once you enter it is easy too see why the facade and decor would not look out of place in an egyptian museum that being said it is wickedly crowded and hard to get a reservation your best bet is to try a weeknight or very late on a weekend we went on a saturday at am and got lucky to get a nice seat drinks are great they have a extensive gin collection to boot and their cocktails are on point definitely worth checking out irrespective of whether you are staying here or just visiting,Positive
atlas,one of the best bars i have ever been to literally really fancy lounges sophisticated decor high ceilings and amazing cocktails if you are ever in singapore definitely plan to grab a drink here and do not forget to dress to impress,Positive
atlas,fricken awesome place this is a must visit place in singapore if you dont drink anywhere else this is the place you have to try the architecture is amazing the staff are all very friendly and customer service driven arrive early for a prime seat,Positive
atlas,step into an art deco fantasy lounge surrounded by a three story high grand lobby catwalk dripping with detail read a cocktail menu written like a story book about the golden age sip some fantastic sgd cocktail blends bathe in chill but upvibe music beats nibble on some apps indulge in good company go home wishing every evening was this fabulous,Positive
atlas,one of sg is most famous bars beautifully decorated with a wide drinks selection had a couple cocktails both the creative take on the classic e g atlas g t atlas martini and the more innovative ones are both good though some err a bit on the sweet sidegood vibes and service would recommend,Positive
atlas,this is a very trendy and interesting bar the decor is quite unique with high ceilings and a very industrial or as one of my coworkers described it ghostbusters vibe to it i am not sure of the official dress code but i saw everything from jeans and t shirts to ballroom gowns and that was the same couple there are quite a few interesting drinks and spirits on the menu and you will pay for them the food menu is a bit limited but everything that we had was quite good they serve their gin drinks in large goblets with lots of ice and they match the tonic with the botanicals in the gin you select which i think is the proper way to do it definitely make a reservation especially if you have a group of more than two people or be willing to wait for however long it takes,Positive
atlas,definitely one of the best bars i have been to period they hold the largest collection of gin in the world and even carry  bottles of champagne that date back to the titanic we my girlfriend and i also had some of the best pasta this bar definitely serves restaurant quality food i would highly recommend the atlas martini and the french  but i am sure that all their other drinks are just as amazing a big shout out to our bartender lee who took us on a private tour of the bar and even took the time to write us a list of bars to try out for the remainder of our trip we will definitely be back the next time we visit singapore,Positive
atlas,wooowwwwwwwwwwwww literally our reaction when we walked into the building and saw the bar this was not a planned stop on our tour our guide just wanted us to walk by but we begged to be allowed one drink you cannot go to a top  bar in the world and not stop right so great intentions only to be told my husband could not enter because his nice shorts were still shorts and that was not allowed not even at pm in  degree weather so fail pay attention to the dress code here and please let me know how amazing it was and how much we missed out,Negative
atlas,if you are looking to relive the roaring  is come here for a drink and you will feel like you are attending a jay gatsby party old sport the space is quite large and absolutely beautiful i also love that they do not cram you in tables right next to one another you will probably have to wait a while if you do not have a reservation but once you are seated you will be able to relax with plenty of elbow space i came here on a weekend in a group of  and waited over an hour to be seated if you like coffee or need a pick me up they have a really interesting cold brew cocktail i recommend all of the drinks were well made and service was friendly plus as an added bonus there is free popcorn,Positive
atlas,amazingly beautiful a high ceiling gorgeous art deco bar with carefully crafted cocktails and great service a place to dress up or visit casually in an amazing building that brings back the golden age of architecture and i understand it was modeled after a s building from new york city i did not try food here although i am sure it is good they do serve caramelized savory popcorn here at the bar which was delicious definitely worth a visit,Positive
atlas,gorgeous spot reminds me of the bar room at the beekman back home except much bigger and a bit more light the drinks were meh tasted like juice but the ambiance and atmosphere were amazing go for a drink or two that is all otherwise you wo not cry if you skip it,Negative
atlas,a good gin bar with a vast selection of gin waitresses were really helpful in recommending gin selection depending on your taste and preference when you are overwhelmed by their selections pretty pricey food but will definitely come back again with friends to try out more gin,Positive
atlas,once you walk in to this place you really feel like you are in a scene of mad men the interior design and staff uniforms really bring a unique feel to this bar the reputation of this place is well deserved food  starsdrinks  starsenvironment service  starsrecommendations louis cartieri came here for dinner the drinks and food here are really pricey but that is expected coming to a venue like this i ordered the cod and the truffle pasta special the food was good and not amazing the portion size is on the small side so you will need to order more than a main to feel full i asked the bartender for a recommendation and ordered the louis cartier this gin based cocktail was really nice and smooth i would definitely order this again,Positive
atlas,if you like art deco and gin you will love this bar they literally have a library of gin that is a beautiful focal point in this gorgeous space the ceilings are super high and there is some seating on the partial second floor on the ground level there are booths comfy chairs loungey chairs and bar seating my friend and i came in the afternoon because who knows what kind of wait they might have for a table at night it was not crowded at all when we went we saw some people having high tea and drinks and just casually catchinwe got drinks and a snack i do not think you can go wrong with their cocktails here as my friend and i both enjoyed ours it did take a while to come out but the waitress was super nice and gave us a free dessert for our patience would highly recommend visiting,Positive
atlas,denying us entry having a strict dress code when there are tons of open tables i am sorry that is beyond stupid and outdated no bar is that cool especially since we knew it would be expensive and we were willing to slap cash down for a gin so thank you for saving us money in the long run it is a beautiful bar that deserves  stars for the design but it is not as cool or unique as level  or the marina bay are to have guests limitations,Positive
atlas,enter atlas one if the world is top bars and if i recall correct world is tallest bar the venue is beautiful reminiscent of an old bank it might have been there are many tables and lounges to sit on in addition to the bar area the cocktail menu is vast and impressive lots of options to choose from by style and spirit the most impressive was the vintage section you could try hundred years old gin but i cant imagine the taste experience my only thing was that it closes early am and last call was at  am being from miami we are used to bars closing past am other than this our visit and experience was truly wonderful,Positive
atlas,i really like the atmosphere of this place and have been coming for a while now the drinks are on the pricey side but the atmosphere is unbeatable best to come with a reservation but if you do not mind waiting for half an hour just pop by the high ceilings and the decor here super love as always what others say the great gatsby feel here is strong they have some complimentary great popcorn but where else can you get some delish madeleines at  midnight drinks here are good and quite strong but for the price you expect them to be the one thing this place lacks is a personal touch even seated at the bar due to the size of this place that is probably why defo bring a date here to impress her,Positive
atlas,favorite bar in singapore love the ambiance and scale feels like stepping into the s wide selection of cocktails menu is like reading a story atlas has gin through the ages food is good as well particularly liked the cheese plate,Positive
atlas,suchhhhhhh a cute bar an absolute must try if you are staying within the area great gatsby vibes with just as magnificent cocktails conjured up to one is liking ingredients are fresh drinks have a bite and ambience is on par if not above and beyond worth a try,Positive
atlas,extremely rude and unaccommodating way overrated so many better places to have a drink eg jw marriott raffles marina bay sands,Positive
atlas,a bar i would been wanting to try for awhile cause fancy gin cocktails are my thing and somehow i ended up in a hotel right across the street at bugis inside the gotham city building the decor inside atlas fits the nickname of the building actually the interiors reminded me of the art deco style of the building that houses yelp in san francisco just gorgeous we came here late on a weeknight and it was packed though we were able to find spots at the bar lots of cozy seating not at the bar too great gin drinks free popcorn nice bartenders the food looked delish too i will come back next time i am in town,Positive
atlas,stellar bar really a good mimic of art deco at its finest certainly one of the best bars in singapore it get a bit crowded with expats after  pm so arrive early the staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the small plates were really tasty see the pics have a g t you will thank me for it the place is certainly no secret you will struggle to get one of their plush seats it is through some locals that i found the place well done,Positive
atlas,the place was within walking distance from the mrt station although it was weekday the place enjoyed a healthy flow of customers for the  of us we were showed to a table with a sofa and  armchairs after looking through the menu we decided on the  course lunch set s  still and sparkling water was chargeable at s  per person for the starters cavolo monachina green cabbage pine nuts raisin anchovies s  savoury cabbage which reminded one of chinese style braised vegetable filling for spring roll with the nuts giving it texture frittata di pasta spaghetti and eggs broccoli rabe sausage s  it was like a pancake made of spaghetti and eggs topped with broccoli and slices of sausage slightly dry but flavourful uova in purgatorio tomato soup and runny egg yolk in the shell s  the dish was served in egg shells which were held upright by salt accompanied with buttery soft toast soldiers underneath the foam was the tomato soup packed with mouthfuls of vegetables plus the egg yolk right below it kind of balance the sour taste of the tomato soup for mains baccala salted cod gaeta olives capsicum neapolitan style s  light battered fish which tasted slightly salty but firm and meaty braised lamb green peas zucchini fresh mint alla scapece s  the lamb was quite tender and sliced easily none of the gamey taste but it was bit too heavily flavoured maine lobster roll artisanal brioche bun marie rose dressing s  topup s  for set the bun looked kind of hard but it was lightly crispy and buttery stuffed with finely chopped pickled vegetables and juicy lobster meat it was quite appetizing lastly the desserts baba infused with frangelico liqueur whipped mascarpone cream s  the baba were cute little buns which were soft and moist could not get enough of them fried is truffoli dough honey and cinnamon parfait s  light crispy puffs paired with ice cream atlas signature madeleines jam and chantilly cream s  it looked simple but i was blown off by the lemony moist texture,Negative
atlas,i absolutely adore this place atlas is an experience the interior itself is one of the most beautiful interiors i have ever seen in a bar or otherwise and it is easily worth whatever price of admission the service is phenomenal the food is phenomenal the drinks are phenomenal everything oozes class and character in a manner which simply cannot be undersold it is breathtaking of course with this experience comes a caveat cost this place is not cheap and the argument could be made that the drinks and food are not as good as the price commands with that said i am inclined to say that the entire package is worth the high price even if the drinks were not the best i have ever had by any stretch the overall atmosphere and experience made them feel like it,Positive
atlas,one of my favorite bars so far very nice cocktails decent and good variety wine list and a very cozy and has a very classic well put together environment i would say it is a intimate and cozy place i was there in the afternoon and had no problem finding a seat however i heard this place gets very crowded at night time vibe is different as well and hard to make a reservation if you are in singapore only for a few days would recommend to go in the afternoon,Positive
atlas,seriously the best bar i have ever been to and my favorite in the entire world exquisite drinks with next level service words cannot describe how awesome this place is my cold brew g t has become my favorite drink and now i make it at home i wish i could have had my going away event here in singapore delicious food coupled with amazing drinks and a vibrant atmosphere make it the go to spot for any occasion they event went out of their way to make me a birthday dessert for lunch unannounced when i mentioned my birthday was a few days ago their lunch special was delicious especially the pork cheek super tender and delicious,Positive
atlas,incredible art deco atmosphere and wonderfully executed food and drinks worth it wanna come back,Positive
atlas,the renewed atlas bar is like a tinder date the idea sounds great you go for the looks and the first impression is amazing but ultimately it is a disappointment this bar looks fantastic the building and interior is really impressive think art deco great gatsby style i was truly wow ed by the atmosphere at first sight but as the night progressed the swinging music changed into a random mix of depressing tracks the menu has quite some cocktails some will set you back  but since i still wanted to eat the remainder of the week my friend and i went for the atlas signature martini not bad plus the glass was very pretty however i prefer a regular dirty martini for my second drink i had a glass of pinot noir which was not bad either but i would have preferred to see more classic cocktails on the menu as i am a classics girl and i also feel it would go well with the theme as for the service i cannot say anything more than that it is a plain disappointment we had to wave down the waitress several times our water was never topped up and they charge  for free flow water and none of the staff made us feel really welcome if i pay almost  a person for two drinks and a cheese plate i do expect good service in short go for the interior snap some pictures but do not expect anything more,Negative
atlas,super bougie spot you have to adhere to ridiculous dress code and ensure you check in with hostess pretty ridiculous when you are visiting and on holiday and willing to spend big bucks but because you are not dress code the bartender will walk you out the door i highly do not recommend if you are on holiday and want to spend money go somewhere else,Negative
atlas,wow the interior of this building and the bar are absolutely stunning this was the first stop on our bar craw of all the locations in singapore that made the world is best bars list the menu has hundreds and hundreds of options but most of them are gin you can order your gin based on the decade it was made from the country of origin or by taste i loved flipping through the menu before settling on the most basic of basic the atlas gin tonic definitely the best g t i have had in my life but then again i have only had a handful worthy of mentioning in the first place however atlas was hands down the most stunning interior i have ever seen my husband and i just sat on the couch with our heads swiveling back and forth taking in the decor in the center of the bar is a giant elevator like shaft with level upon level of bottles and a little dolly for the employees to harness themselves in and wheel up and down i was super disappointed nobody used it while we were there this is absolutely worth a stop while you are in singapore and right next door to the andaz hotel but remember to look sharp there is a dress code we got our drinks around noon and we got to cuddle up on a couch and listen to the music definitely made us feel like we are far fancier than reality world is  best bars  manhattan singapore atlas singapore operation dagger singapore  hongkong street singapore tippling club singapore native singapore,Positive
atlas,came here shortly after they re opened not too bad good selection of spirits especially gin interior space is obviously impressive with high ceilings and the feel of an old world hotel lobby service was prompt and good as well overall seems like a good place for business style meetings hope to check out the food next time,Positive
atlas,atlas offers fantastic ambience with food drinks and service to match we went for lunch the venison tenderloin was super tender and had no gamey taste the salmon was poached cooked to perfection of course the signature martini was excellent at sgd  lunch for  was not inexpensive but the quality of the experience was very worthwhile we recommend atlas for people looking for top quality western food a pretty good value for lunch  or  course fixed price menu,Positive
atlas,update i finally found myself wearing acceptable attire to be allowed admission into the bar staff were super preoccupied but when i caught their attention they were friendly drinks are interesting and well made and the atmosphere inarguably transports you to gatsby the staff offered me a petting aperitif before i left as they were entertaining a large group at the bar it was a nice gesture given their preoccupation with the large clearly more jovial patrons if you find yourself in artdecowear and there is a spot readily available i would say it is worth a stop if you like pretentious bars with mediocre drinks in a fantastic art deco setting this is your place if you love great drinks and good company there are too many other places in singapore do not waste your time here,Positive
atlas,it is been a few months since they were able to work out their opening kinks and i found this bar to be absolutely stunning in every way the impression you get when you walk in is breathtaking where you feel you walk into a totally different era reminds me of a different version of eleven madison park in nyc the classic art deco new york city feel drinks are wonderful i had one that had some cardamom and gin and it was fantastic they have a huge gin tower with the largest selection of gin i have ever seen and some interesting vintage gin that did not taste much different to me i tried the s gin great bartenders and friendly hostesses i have been here  times and found service to be fine at peak and normal hours so maybe they got it down definitely a hot spot that i would highly recommend and make reservations for only downside is that since that area is still full of surrounding construction it is not too easy to call a cab or pin point the uber location since the  north bridge address is the entire building is address with a drop off point in front of the building atlas is in the back make sure you are in dress code if you are there after  pm before  pm they are ok with t shirts shorts and slippers afterwards they are not cool with it,Positive
atlas,this art deco cocktail bar is one of the most beautiful bars i have ever visited they have an impressive collection of hard liquor and i particularly enjoyed my churchill drink which had a lovely smoky flavor this place is definitely worth a visit if you are in singapore for work or pleasure,Positive
atlas,the ambiance is great but with the capacity so small it makes getting a seat difficult even at the bar actually you cannot just go in and grab a bar seat so i would not call this place a bar but rather a lounge we waited for  minutes and decided to leave,Negative
atlas,this place is just completely inspiring the cocktails are absolutely delicious and the space is incredible i have never seen a cocktail menu that is more intriguing than this one got to come back for the bottle of wine from the shipwreck ask about it,Positive
atlas,atlas is a swanky newish bar near bugis which is quite dramatic in a number of ways as you enter the art deco space you feel like you are in nyc and not in singapore and the space is amazing there are liquor bottles stacked on shelves that can be accessed only by ladders there is a champagne room as well where they store their extensive selection menu wise the focus here is on gin and champagne although they have a decent selection of whiskey and other booze as well and personally it is the only place in town with a decent selection of genever most bars would be lucky to have a single bottle but here there are probably over  different bottles the total tally for gin is over   different bottles from around the globe the bartenders are quite good with a few i recognized from other great singapore bars such as anti dote it is a bit more formal here and even for an open bar seat you do need to check in with the host i have always gone early though so getting a seat has not been a problem although i can imagine this place getting packed later in the evening but with the great selection of genever i am already a regular and it is well worth a visit,Positive
atlas,gorgeous bar in the stunning parkview building a huge cocktail menu dress code after  pm,Positive
atlas,great decor with a very large gin selection courteous hostess and bartenders stopped by here to try some navy strength offerings four pillars navy strength jumped off the page at me but i found to be a bit too lemony and reverted back to bombay sapphire not used to queue for bar seating hostess alerted me that i jumped a queue of a party of  waiting for a table and escorted me back from a bar stool to the entrance when it was my turn next i was told which stool to sit in without an option although there were many stools open a little too regimented and full of themselves for my taste,Positive
atlas,the waitress called her manager to confirm if she can let us in the woman came out and gave a look at us from head to toe we both had black dresses and flats and she did a weird facial expression with disgust whispering to the waitress that we cannot go in and the waitress came and told us it is  hour wait although it was half empty inside worst treatment i have ever got unbelievably rude,Negative
atlas,overall i am a fan of a beautiful space with a great cocktail menu this is something that atlas does get points for the service however was as bad as it gets we were told it would be a  minute wait for a table so we decided to take a walk and came back  minutes later once we came back we waited another  minutes to be seated at a standing table the menu looked great so i was totally okay with it however after standing around for  minutes with not one server waiter approaching us i went back to the hostess stand to ask them if we needed to order at the bar in order to get service they told me someone should and would be coming to take our order at the table fifteen minutes later still no server in sight we decided that this kind of service was not only bad but also truly obnoxious and unacceptable my husband and i both walked out of the bar and explained to the hostesses why we were leaving they did not seem to care i have experienced some amazing nights out at some of the finest restaurants and cocktail bars during my  week stay in singapore this was by far the worst experience i have had,Negative
atlas,the star of this place is the interior straight out of the art deco era very cool great cocktails and good service evidently it just got named to best  bars in the world,Positive
atlas,truly one of the most beautiful bars i have visited worldwide especially if you are an art deco fan appears that no expense was spared in construction so the higher than usual singapore prices are not totally offensive we looked forward to a nd visit on our return to singapore this month unfortunately what we witnessed on this visit was shocking totally unacceptable far below even the most basic minimal service standards we arrived about  pm which is  hours after the  am opening hour asked to be seated at the bar that is nearest to the entrance reception stand sitting at this bar also provides the best view of the tower bar at the opposite end of the room a sweeping view over the entire room there were  other guests sitting at the bar when we were seated we quickly noticed they were staring at an employee who was standing on top of the back bar doing what appeared to be some type of bottle inventory the first thought was that this work should be done before or after opening hours instead of during the start of cocktail hour however far worse was the fact that this employee was still wearing her shoes while she moved around the back bar top the same bar top where food is set when it arrives from the kitchen the same space that is used for other bar preparations so totally absolutely unsanitary that we like the other customers we shocked at such a complete lack of professionalism it was so unsuspected that we asked the bartender if a manager was on duty so we could voice a complaint imagine our surprise when the bartender replied she is the manager as he pointed to the clueless young lady standing on the bar top in her dirty shoes we then decided to move to the tower bar avoid the unsanitary performance being conducted in front of us before departing however we voiced our dissatisfaction to the female manager for her complete lack of judgement the fact that her unprofessional behavior was in full view of both fellow employees customers her response a shrug of her shoulders as if to say so what i do this all the time which she probably does at the very least her actions call into question the existence of professional management at atlas if a general manager actually condones such unprofessional actions then it is time for new far more professional quality management,Negative
atlas,easily one of the most beautiful buildings i have been in in singapore and quite possibly one of the most impressive bars looks wise i have ever been in which is saying a lot because i have been in a lot of bars first off gone is the wine fairy or whatever the place was before they redid it and it is now the gatsby esque atlas the building itself is quite impressive although there really is nothing else around it so no bar hopping here it is very classy and very big we started at the bar but when an annoying guy started talking about tonic we went for a table we started with two atlas martinis which were made with gin and orange bitters as well as champagne i believe it was sweet and really nice but at  a pop i should hope so the menu is mainly gin and champagne focused they also have  vintage cocktails for you major ballers or those on a company expense account food wise they have some variety but nothing really made me excited so we started with a cheese plate at  which was excellent after my martini i had a nice glass of chardonnay which was presented well while i realize atlas just opened there are a few tweaks that need major improvement music when we arrived it was nice playing things like remixes of mr sandman and light jazzy  is music which i thought really lent itself to the atmosphere but as the night went on the music got really weird and depressing like the theme from the titanic when they die honestly it made me want to get out of there certainty not somewhere i wanted to hang if i was in the mood to serious drink service needs some major improvement staff is young and not really on point especially for the prices you are paying i realize   a cocktail is getting to be the norm in singapore for a quality made cocktail but i also realize service should be much better for this price point the hostess who perhaps also doubled as a waitress not sure sat at the table next to us with two guys all night chatting while we clearly needed another drink water ect it was more annoying than anything all in all def worth a peek to see the atmosphere ect but perhaps wait until they improve the service and music,Positive
din-tai-fung,this is our favorite city chow we regularly go when we are shopping downtown and also bring out of town visitors the crab dumplings are my favorite but the hubs loves the green beans we always order wonton soup,Positive
din-tai-fung,for those who are used to the din tai fung locations in the u s prepare for a treat having said that if you are used to the din tai fung locations in taiwan or china singapore offers a slightly scaled down version more comparable to those locations in australia star  how were the service and atmosphere this din tai fung location is great tucked away in an underground mall with ample seating to my great shock we were seated immediately on a saturday afternoon and the place was virtually empty star star  how were the portions relative to the cost  sgd for  pieces of classic pork xlb is reasonable for singapore and other menu items were in the same reasonable ballpark refreshing given how expensive things can get here in singapore star stars  and  how was the food everything we ordered was good with particular kudos to the xlb and the pork buns one thing that i missed were the leaf wrapped rice dishes that i am accustomed to in china at din tai fung but what was offered on the menu there were other several sold out items was well executed single star star  would you be excited to go back always star,Positive
din-tai-fung,food was great especially this red dates with glutinous rice my new favorite food it seemed that they should have more people work here it was really busy during lunch time and the service was kind of slow,Positive
din-tai-fung,excellent chicken soup and various buns to try out nice place to eat for lunch or diner,Positive
din-tai-fung,this was my favorite din tai fung dining experience to date i went on a weekend and it was empty what a refreshing surprise same consistency and all dishes were great but without any wait was amazing they did have a chili crab bun which is unique to singapore really enjoyed it reminded me of a crab cake with traditional chili crab flavor notes,Positive
din-tai-fung,if you are in singapore and want great food in a definitely non touristy place this is it,Positive
din-tai-fung,this place is packed and for a good reason craving xiao long bao and this hit the spot ordered the vegetable pork dumpling in chicken broth and that was amazing the servers are not great at communicating in english also they are very strange with refilling water   they would not unless your glass was empty and would only refill one person at a time and left unless you specifically stated to refill everyone is glass also double check if your order is correct on the receipt they misordered one of our dish but luckily i caught it before they sent it out so a new receipt was easily produced,Negative
din-tai-fung,okay so it is a chain but omg they have got food service down to a science and their food chemistry is incredible i am so happy my husband i came here on our trip to singapore he is half asian so he is super picky about asian food and even he said it was the best dim sum he is had in years definitely hoping the one near our home in california is as good as our experience in singapore,Positive
din-tai-fung,food is good they deserve credit for that but the hostess is awful the wait staff are poorly trained waiting in line for   hour is a challenge but you should expect much better service too many other really good dim sum options within this city expect more singapore you do not have to be the city of poor service,Negative
din-tai-fung,wanted to try dtf since i learned that they have a location in los angeles ca never made it there but i had to try it here at least xiao long baos are good thin and bouncy wrapper flavorful filling but comes at the high cost our lunch today was  sgd which is crazy expensive for what it is it was hard to find them the basement of the link mall was super hard to find i wish there were better street signs,Positive
din-tai-fung,the dumplings with truffles are out of this world highly recommended cannot wait to be back in singapore again,Positive
din-tai-fung,what is all the fuss about of all the delicious hawker centers countless restaurants in chinatown why eat in a basement mall quick service meh ambience and just ok dim sum ok tom cruise has been there but i am going back to chinatown next time,Negative
din-tai-fung,excellent food the veg dumplings are awesome one of the best the la lian is very good as well but be prepared to stand in the queue during lunch time it is very crowded,Positive
din-tai-fung,super expensive for what you get but not bad in terms of soup dumplings i have had better though but this is good for a quick bite,Positive
din-tai-fung,my favorite restaurant and food in asia apart from ajisen ramen really love their salads fried rice and of course their very famous dumplings specially xiaolongbao the best and you can watch them making your dumplings so interesting and cool must go must see and must try we also loved their seaweed salad vegetable dumplings steamed veggies and one of my favorites vegetable and tofu salad does not sound that great but tastes amazing,Positive
din-tai-fung,odd to admit this but this din tai fung location was yummier than my local joint here in arcadial what is the difference i want to say it might be the asian meat they use shrug it is just everything is just a slight notch yummier the restaurant itself is so clean service is quick if you are in singapore make sure to swing by i know it is a bit pricier than the other options esp those hawker stands but it is worth your time money enjoy,Positive
din-tai-fung,xian long boa freshly made dumplings from pork to veggie fillings these are definitely must have when you are in singapore you can get either pcs or pcs prices varied from  sd to  sd it really depends on fillings while you are waiting you can even watch and learn the art of the chef is craft just expect a long queue,Positive
din-tai-fung,tasty food good service ambiance is not ideal it is in the basement food court of a mall,Positive
din-tai-fung,this place is so addicting many things have been said about their classic pork dumplings but they really are the best the dough is not too thick or too thin the meat is a perfect flavour and the dumplings are steamed to perfection little balls of heaven i also love their fried rice the egg fried rice is the best i have had yet and tastes perfect i have fruitlessly tried to get good basic fried rice and have found that this place does it best the garlic chili wantons are great as well and come in a very tasty dark chili sauce they also have a small variety of vegetables which are enhanced by some garlic sauce and taste very good i have tried the other varieties of dumplings such as the vegetable ones and the pork and shrimp they are good but in my opinion the classic pork ones are the best the vegetable ones seem a bit dry and the pork shrimp ones have very thick dough the food comes super fast when you are eating in and of course seems to take longer when you are waiting for it as a take away i am super addicted and do not mind the wait because they make everything fresh regarding the setting it is located in marina bay link mall so basically in an underground tunnel which is also a shopping centre with various shops cafes its not the most relaxing ambiance but i very much doubt people seek this place out for the amazing setting the food makes it worth it and the restaurant itself is big enough where you can feel a bit removed if you do not sit right by the window overall great food and consistent quality,Positive
din-tai-fung,having now permanently move to singapore din tai fung is now my to go place for a quick xiao long bao fix it is not the best xia long bao i have ever tasted honestly i think crystal jade is xiao long bao is better but i love their other chinese dishes as well like dumpling in vinegar chili sauce and fried rice cos let is be honest i do not know about you but for me eating xiao long bao alone for a meal will never made me satisfied yeah yeah i know i am a girl with a big appetite and i like varieties i love that though din tai fung is a chain restaurant but they always maintain their standard really well the food taste wise is always consistent service is okay not bad but def could be improved please keep in mind that dtf is always crowded so come at weird hours like   pm or   pm if you want to avoid long queue they take reservation if you have  people or more in your group,Positive
din-tai-fung,lots of great foods i loved the fresh made dumplings the nome made noodles and the vegetable sides lots of healthy choices,Positive
din-tai-fung,very good authentic fresh dumplings the only thing is that it is not very cozy and very loud in this place on the other hand you get really awesome food at a cheap price,Positive
din-tai-fung,on a recent trip to singapore did my pilgrimage to the local dtf partially because you can never get enough of what may be the best xiao long bao dumplings in the world but also as a fan i wanted to compare to the taiwan and l a versions i will say that they are not quite as good as those two mainly because i understand these are franchises rather than direct original family owned like in taiwan and l a also they have opened a mind boggling number of them in singapore we were eating in a dtf that was mere blocks from another branch in an adjacent mall even considering that it is still  stars because even a lesser xlb dumpling from din tai fung by far trumps the best from anywhere else i have ever had there is no comparison i also am an advocate for the thinner lighter skins they use versus the more traditional thicker wrapping it highlights the filling i will say the singapore restaurants and taiwan have somewhat larger variety than the l a branch however the juicy pork and juicy pork and crab are unbeatable so it is gilding the lily actually i personally did not like the truffle dumpling which seems to be only available in asian branches very much i also had the opportunity to eat some other non dumpling dishes since my in laws like the variety and i have to say that dtf also excelled in those as well of course while well executed these dishes are not the revelation that their xlb are i will shamelessly quote another reviewer mel p because they said it perfectly din tai fung should be some kind of universal translations for best dumpling ever,Positive
din-tai-fung,came here twice in the six weeks i have been here the soup dumplings are tasty but i feel like the place has become overrated and souper pricey haha other items are good small in portion the only thing that was unique was the steamed chili crab and pork buns those were pretty spectacular,Positive
din-tai-fung,i have been the din tai fung in arcadia california which is really good but man in this one in singapore the steam dumplings are amazing pork veg and the truffle one is excellent so had the steam dumplings and some of the side dishes like sliced duck in crispy spring onion pastry oriental salad in special vinegar dressing stir fried dou miao with garlic and lots of dumplings did not have any of their fresh juice drinks or the desserts but they looked really good but it is also really cool to watch them make the dumplings it is like watching ninja is make my dumplings in their white outfits,Positive
din-tai-fung,dumplings for god sakes get the dumplings just incredible this is my second visit to singapore and on the flight over all i could think about was these dumplings,Positive
din-tai-fung,dtf at singapore is really good wow what a big different in between dtf at so cal and dtf singapore the quality the taste the texture of the food and the presentation wow i cannot stop saying wow the restaurant is crowded but the service is excellent pork dumpling in the spicy sauce head down for this one if i ever mentioned the pork dumpling in spicy sauce is good at so cal i probably never had any better until this one shows up the flour dough is thin and smooth meat is juicy tender fresh and tasty and the sauce that goes with it is lightly seasoned but it was not bland you can taste every single ingredients in the bowl mr q and i ordered  times from the same dish that is how good it is truffle xiao long bao normally i am not very fascinated about truffles however this time the truffle did work together with the pork bun the pork bun has a nice aroma of the truffle and also the freshness and the tenderness of the meat filling mouth watering when i try to remember how i bite the xiao long bao open and have a sneak peek inside trying to not drop the xiao long bao while admire it a excellent must try dish xiao long bao the flour dough is thin the soup broth is the bun is tasty and the temperature of the soup is just nice it did not burn my tongue the pork filling is juicy tender and fresh duck roll smoked duckling meat in a crispy layer of the spring roll the duck meat is lightly smoked chewy in a good way and salty but the green onion and the crispy spring roll balanced the tasty salty duck meat an excellent dish oriental salad in special vinegar dressing crisps greens and soggy rice vermicelli the sauce was not overpowering the salad however there was not anything special about this dish crab meat xiao long bao it tasted similar to the xiao long bao however the crab meat texture is a little bit dry and the broth in the bun is a bit lukewarm steamed red bean bao the flour dough looks puffy the bun was fluffy and the filling were lightly sweetened the aroma of red bean and yam is strong and the filling were moist it was not chunky at all lemongrass juice was exotic and interesting it definitely gives you the coolness in the super hot city the only cons that i can think of this place is dear manager please get rid of the christmas decorations from last year i highly recommend this dtf for all my yelpers if you have the chance to visit singapore it is a must go,Positive
din-tai-fung,ok white guy alert here i loved the place but i am not a connoisseur of dim sum though now i think i know what i need to know to at least write a review the net of my experience there was that they are fast and fresh i do not know if that is a good thing in a traditional dim sum eatery but for us it was great they had a few entrees that were from a traditional kitchen think of teriyaki chicken in a sushi restaurant the food came in shifts like sushi can and it was all good not great to me but it was good i would go back and i would wait in line to eat there,Positive
din-tai-fung,this is a great stop for lunch yes it is a chain and we do not normally frequent chains much but it was recommended by a colleague and was well worth of the recommendation great lunch and some of the best dim sum i have had in singapore,Positive
din-tai-fung,it is true din tai fung really does taste better in asia i could eat heaps of xiao long bao soup dumplings for days perfectly made these little soup dumplings are seriously a happy medley in my mouth depending on which location you go to some may have an hour long wait ahem orchard road however this location seemed a bit more remote it is in the basement of a corporate building so we had no issues with the wait time they were really on top of their service too attentive but not overbearing we ordered and in no time our food was out already great experience must eat at a din tai fung while in singapore any din tai fung will do,Positive
din-tai-fung,a lot of friends recommended this place and now i understand why the food was very good and the service good willing to help and very fast we had pork and vegetable dumplings and noodles all of them very tasty and big size i would love to come back,Positive
din-tai-fung,super dumplings along with noodle dishes and others quite good for a chain of fast food places and i could visit several times a week,Positive
din-tai-fung,good quality dumplings a bit pricey but that is expected the noodles were good as well gets very busy at dinner time,Positive
din-tai-fung,poor service bland and tasteless food limited choices pricey never to return again,Negative
din-tai-fung,huge fan of din tai fung have been to dtf in hk la seoul shanghai kuala lumpur bangkok and singapore the dishes at this location was rather bland ordered crab and pork xlb pork chop and chili crab bun pork bun all bland not sure if will come back to this specific location,Negative
din-tai-fung,woohoo first sg review what to say except that the dimsums were fabulous my friend and i ordered quite a lot of food actually maybe too much but it felt so right as we were eating these dumplings we tried steamed dumplings with vegetables pork shrimp and crab also we tasted the dates filled with rice and the chili wanton soup my absolute favorites the shrimp and then the veggies then we gave a shot to the sweet dumplings and were absolutely amazed by the coconut peanut ones as for the red beans they were not too sweet but the peanut was particularly flavorful also we tried the almond and sesame pudding quite odd to say but the almond tasted a bit artificial while the sesame is bitterness was just perfect overall excellent dishes for about  only complaint the service i do not know if it is considered normal in sg but the waiters exclusively spoke mandarin and the bill was also in mandarin my friend who lives here was also shocked so i guess there could be room for improvement i guess i will go back for sure just for the shrimp and the peanut except if i find another dimsum place that has even more outstanding flavors,Positive
din-tai-fung,absolutely solid buns great selection made fresh on site good variety and low key atmosphere value for money make this chain a go to in singapore,Positive
din-tai-fung,decent place i read rave reviews and it is a solid place but nothing special in my opinon,Negative
din-tai-fung,what more needs to be said about din tai fung the chain leaves crystal jade in the dust honestly why do people in singapore still go to crystal jade that is the kind of crazy they do not even have medication for i for one am not a fan of the truffle xiao long bao this may be controversial i am an xlb purist i do not even need vinegar or ginger and believe the truffle flavour overpowers the awesome minced pork fat flavour din tai fung makes a good solid dependable basic xlb and you should order like  as soon as you sit down per person apart from the xlb i like the pork chop fried rice the drunken chicken and this prawn pancake thing they have i forget the name of the dish on the menu why people still order dan dan mien here is totally beyond me also it tastes like nothing but peanuts people check out the braised beef soup also it is a gem this particular dtf is an excellent venue for dinner because there is like never a queue imagine walking straight into a dtf without taking a ticket or having to stand uncomfortably propped up against a mall fixture in a sea of people waiting for your number to pop up a magical utopian wonderland you say no it is marina bay link mall where nobody goes in the evening lunch however is a different story,Negative
din-tai-fung,fantastic food amazing dumplings usually a bit of a wait but they move fast and are efficient so you wont be waiting too long,Positive
din-tai-fung,yay i love din tai fung i come here to get my share of pork xia long bao is and probably pork xia long bao is only or mainly we get three stacks to share between the two and order few extra side dishes we feel like eating that day though is it wrong to say that i actually like new york is joe shanghai xia long bao is a bit more it is a bit thicker and more soup y than the ones here it is a perfect place to pig out after a visit to the marina bay casinos for expats wait seems to depend on when you go at our last visit on a weekend the line was out the door,Positive
din-tai-fung,i am take to this franchise and am attracted to dtf whenever i am overseas and come across its iconic red sign with han letters i am also always quite surprised how so many americans like the food here it is interesting to see different form of their xlb chicken instead of pork in the indon one i was always fascinated with the xlb that had assorted colors it almost makes the meal look like it is something to play with pink green yellow etc other then the delicious pork xlb they actually do not place the ginger in the soy sauce and eat them in shanghai itself i usually go for the lamian noodles or fried rice when i am at dtf alone or not with a large group of friends the lamian is pretty plain but it is springly and soaks up the broth and tastes so good in your mouth just plain noodles and broth the soup is clear and slightly dark with a thin layer of oil at the top scoop up a while eating the noodles to quench your thirst or if the chilli is too hot i am generally a happy man when i get fragrant fried rice with succulent prawns add some chilli for a kick this outlet is pretty good but the people in the raffles city one seem to one you to hurry up and finish your meal so they can prepare the table for the next guests they charge for water too i think,Positive
din-tai-fung,i was there on a saturday evening without reservation after  mins i was seated the quality of the food is amazing and the dumplings were the best i have ever had it was a good mix of locals and tourists,Positive
din-tai-fung,i had a great dim sum the pork buns were tasty and the shrimp and pork dumplings were my favorite i am generally not a big fan of the shrimp and pork buns but the ones i had here were ok i also had the shrimp fried rice which i enjoyed the bill was not cheap for dim sum but you get what you pay for i would go back for sure,Negative
din-tai-fung,wow i cannot believe that i found a din tai fung here in the middle of marina bay link mall i came on a saturday and surprise surprise the place was relatively empty we got a seat immediately at pm contrast this to tampines mall or wisma where you have to wait at least a good  minutes before being ushered during dinner peak hours that already bumped my rating for this place up a little and i realised they have fancy schmancy stuff here that perhaps cannot be found in other din tai fung outlets for one the truffle xiao long bao it is really pricey at   per bao but i suppose it will probably have a great aftertaste the price put me off a little so did not try but i would certainly recommend anyone to give it a go i had the duck crepe thingy here and its really good the duck aroma immediately fills your mouth the moment you pop each piece in and it goes down really well when paired with fried rice service is a bit slow but staff are really helpful and courteous so this place gets a five star from me,Positive
din-tai-fung,in the event you don tknow this is actually a international chain store unforunately this chain store is only located in the west coast cali come to ny please i love the soup dumplings yes i know there are soup dumplings in nyc but this takes it to the next level this place is good and you know you want more,Positive
din-tai-fung,met up with a friend to catch lunch here the oriental wantons and dumplings were some of the best i have ever had will definitely go back to check out the rest of their menu,Positive
din-tai-fung,i am a big fan of din tai fung but for some reason this one in mbs is not at par with the ones in paragon and raffles the food came cold and not as delicious i tolerate the rude service and the fact that none of the servers can understand english because of the quality of the food is really good but the one in mbs did not overcome these nuances so i will stick to the ones in paragon and raffles,Negative
din-tai-fung,expensive for the portions not the best food i have ever had and far from it still a good taste of chinese cuisine atmosphere was not great very noisy and the service was subpar food made up for it by being pretty decent but again expensive for the portions,Positive
din-tai-fung,it is really expensive but the soup dumplings are excellent and the truffle ones are mind blowingly good easily the best soup dumplings i have ever had the skin is nearly translucent and you can see how much broth is in each xlb they are rich in flavor and the meat is quite tender and not overcooked in essence they are the perfect bitei have been to the din tai fung in la seattle and bellevue and this one blows them out of the water,Positive
din-tai-fung,din tai fung should be some kind of universal translation for best dumplings ever i cannot think of any chain restaurant in the world this consistently good and cannot resist a visit whenever i see one to date i have ticked sydney bangkok singapore and kl off the list each with slight variations in the menu but always awesome,Positive
din-tai-fung,ate here several times during family vacation in singapore fast service even though always busy best dumplings anywhere,Positive
din-tai-fung,you simply cannot go wrong with din tai fung i have not ordered anything i did not like with my favorites being the xiao long bao all and fried rice with shrimps and eggs i also love the ambiance of this place so high class yet affordable,Positive
din-tai-fung,went there for lunch in singapore we got there early so a table was availaible however when we left people were in line excellent food dim sum braised beef noodles were delicious i would highly recommend good value and service,Positive
din-tai-fung,omg dtf this chain goes from strength to strength sure it is pricey  for three of us but not really for the delicious dumplings noodles and so on the system is a little confusing for those who like to line up plus this dtf is in a vegas style mall so you can shop as well,Positive
din-tai-fung,there may be other cheaper places to get dumplings in singapore but i particularly appreciate the vegetarian options on the dtf menu vegetarian does not mean mushrooms or gooey tofu here not that there is a ton of variety but they do the few vegetarian items that they do very well the steamed vegetable dumplings are light and tasty i love the plain noodle bowls with sauce over them i believe the dan dan noodles and the noodles with peanut sauce or house sauce or something are vegetarian at minimum they are visibly meat less admittedly it is tough to get the staff to stick around your table long enough to answer detailed questions about the menu or ingredients because the place is constantly busy language has also been a slight barrier for me at times in cases where i want to know exactly what is in a dish there are plenty of plates of lightly sauteed greens on the menu yawn but the surprising favorite in the starters category are cucumbers dressed in some combo of vinegar and soy sauce plus lots of minced garlic ridiculous to order simple cucumbers in a restaurant but i cannot always resist plus i prefer the dressing as a dumpling dip far more than the soy sauce vinegar ginger combo i can mix for myself at the table,Positive
din-tai-fung,i have been to dtf in four five maybe six different cities throughout the world this is one of the best of course the original in taipei brings back great memories but this one takes the prize for one of the best in the world at the time we visited they were serving chili crab dumplings that was one of the best dumplings that i have ever had i will be posting a more in depth posting on xlb when i end up rating dim sum garden in philly as well as red farm in west village nyc if you can make the trip to singapore this is a must go,Positive
din-tai-fung,not all the din tai fung outlets serve truffle xiao long bao but this one does once you have eaten that you cannot really go back to their regular ones another bonus is that it is not very crowded so it is easier to get a table on weekends,Negative
the-sushi-bar,the service at sushi bar was great with an extremely polite and conscientious staff decor of the location was very intimate but also great for larger groups came here on my birthday and ordered tuna sashimi comes with three large pieces of raw fish crab stick roll and the salmon aburi all of the sushi tasted fresh and was of high quality for a fair price they even put a little candle on the sushi so i kinda had to give it  stars would definitely recommend,Positive
the-sushi-bar,oh this was a great choice to come here it is not easy to find as it is inside the mall and the numbering of stores is hard to figure out but looking for it is worth it i had the california roll very nice the salmon aburi wow and the spicy tuna another wow everything tasted so good and i enjoyed my time here a lot the cold sake was also a good choice,Positive
the-sushi-bar,i came here whilst on a business trip circa  i happened upon this establishment one night i ordered two rolls and a coke no sugar formerly known as coke zero the rolls were quite delicious my bill was  for just myself which is sort of a rip off but singapore is kind of a rip off itself since i put this meal on my expense report and was reimbursed in full i did not not ding them a star for the high price should i visit singapore again and stay at the not so grand hyatt i may return here for some sushi,Negative
the-sushi-bar,sometimes the hard to find the out of the way the small places are the very best i am an aficionado of sushi sashimi and i was very pleased with my order here at sushi bar this is the first time i found blue fin tuna in a sushi restaurant yes it is pricey but wow what a difference excellent i also ordered the kodai sushi and it was excellent,Positive
the-sushi-bar,good prices but fish not really that fresh think the taka outlet is way better which is strange as they should use the same supplier good and friendly service though,Negative
the-sushi-bar,omg yelp let me down big time i do not know how this place can be rated    stars i am pretty sure you can get much better sushi at costco and better cuts of fish at any isetan japanese market i was pretty excited to dine here since it was located at the far east plaza right next to the hotel so it was pretty effortless to get here after work the sushi bar is located on the th floor of this less than glam shopping plaza where merchants stand outside their shops preying on walker bys it kinda reminds me of an indoor flea market with roll up doors where they sell lots of shimmering cheap stretch pants and battery operated clapping toys i was convinced that the sushi bar was just a gem located inside this  is time warped mall i sat down and ordered some green tea the  kind sashimi and the hamachi kama which they warn you takes  min to prepare my first disappointment was the tea bag i expect it from a mr sushi or a sushi food truck but this place was a    star establishment man my dish of  pcs of sashimi quickly showed up the first bite of the swordfish was like biting into a cold tough piece of goodyear tire there was no way my incisors could completely penetrate that nearly inch thick piece of white radial i quickly moved to the other fish and none were impressive at all either the octopus was not appealing either with the big suckers staring at me the grilled hamachi cheek was the only thing that somewhat saved this place from being a  star it was good but still not great another thing i noticed was the lack of hygene in the handling of the soy sauce dishes the guy stuck his thumb right on the top surface of where people pour their soy sauce some people may not care or pay attention to details like this but this germaphobe wo not be returning here they set the sushi bar way too low to be enjoyed by this foodie,Negative
the-sushi-bar,this place is hidden on the th floor if you are in the mood for sushi this place is perfect no wait yesterday at  pm the sushi is delicious service impeccable,Positive
the-sushi-bar,ebi fry salmon aburizal    starsnot very flavourful just decent the sushi at aburi sushi heishirou at westgate was better and cheaper although it is kind of out of the way the place is also rather crowded so it is not great for a nice quiet dinner,Positive
the-sushi-bar,heard that this was the best sushi joint in singapore so we had to try the restaurant was extremely hard to find no one knew where it was and we were misdirected  times before we finally found it on the th floor once we got in we were quickly seated and the servers promptly gave us tea and took our orders they were very friendly and helpful giving us suggestions on what to order and portion control we ordered a small sashimi sampler  rolls from the chefs recommendation menu and wagyu aburi sushi best idea ever the sashimi was super thick and delicious but i have to say my fav was the wagyu melt on your tongue aburi sushi and the scallop roll made the trip well worth if you have a couple if hours to kill and an urge to go on an adventure give this place a try itll for sure satisfy your starving stomach after the treacherous journey to get here,Positive
the-sushi-bar,fresh fish generous portions fast professional service a reasonable price what more can you ask for my husband and i went here based on a yelp suggestion that popped up on my screen and it was a block away from my hotel so how could i say no it was a little bit challenging to find it because it is all the way in the back of the mall and the mall directory needs to be updated with its listing but after we found it and waited in line it was so worth it i had the normal churasi don plate which was a nice selection of fish including salmon smoked salmon tuna scallop egg salmon roe and another one i cannot remember all are top quality and generously sized pieces husband had the smoked salmon roll some salmon sushi and two hand rolls the hand rolls were like deconstructed cut rolls with a twist if you want to go exotic and get premium sashimi you can do this here too check out the premium and seasonal donburi selections very impressive for such a low key place,Positive
the-sushi-bar,yes i also get the raving reviews now we decided to pop in on a saturday night after the gym protein and were lucky to find only a few people queuing so we got a table in no time and ordered scallop carpaccio agedashi tofu sashimi and a seasonal chirashi don the fish was amazing the tofu bowl the broth especially was very tasty and the scallop carpaccio divine i found my favourite beer suntory premium and the service was very friendly and fast the interior is modern but more on the functional side anyhow you do not come here for the furnishings you come here for sushi i would not take a first date or celebrate my anniversary here but i will certainly be back for their delectable sushi and good service at a price tag that does not involve cringing when you see the bill,Positive
the-sushi-bar,ars you looking for value for money sushi in a restaurant that takes restaurants looking for a decently priced pint of beer to cool off the sushi bar is your place for all three of the above reasons love that you can sms them to make a reservation queues can get long so definitely make a reservation if you know you will be headed there the chirashi bowl is my go to item on the menu with a nice cold asahi or sapporo of course,Positive
the-sushi-bar,i was taken here for dinner on a monday night and we got here before pm so there was not a queue there is a promotion where you get  rolls for the price of  and my companion by some oversight ordered the prawn soft shell crab and salmon rolls which all happened to be aburi ed i loved the rolls but three aburi ed rolls which sort of taste the same after a while for  people are a bit much and hence we struggled to finish the rolls which resulted in a fair bit of waste we also got the normal chirashi a portion of salmon sashimi a pitan tofu the chirashi was topped with thickly sliced fish of various varieties and the rice was sufficiently vinegared yum my favorite was the pitan tofu tofu is actually a misnomer as they use egg custard as the tofu and then top it with century eggs flying fish roe spring onions and shredded surimi i really liked this prices here are very reasonable for what they are i guess this is the singapore version of hole in the wall sushi tucked in a corner of orchard road they should probably have a sake shot promo just to value add,Positive
the-sushi-bar,i did not know about this place until a yelper recommended it the word sushi was an immediately yes when she suggested having our dinner there no regrets at all hidden on the th floor of far east plaza a mall that needs some upgrading to compete with its rivals my first impression of the place is this must be a low cost type japanese restaurant as its interior and menu matches to my impression but the cost of the food is at a different level i ordered the normal chirashi set a bowl of rice with a mixture of assorted meat that cost  to try out since i was told how good the food is when my meal was served my eyes popped out when i saw the portion of the meat it is probably the most generous portion i come across in singapore so far my first bite of it has made me craved for more while engaging a conversation with my friend i cannot help but to enjoy every bite of it multi tasking at the same time eating  and listening  it was that enjoyable i had the chawamushi steamed egg and that is pretty decent so for the  i paid for the meal it is certainly worth the enjoyment like they say sometimes it is good to spend more for good food this is one example,Positive
the-sushi-bar,i am never a big fan of aburi as i have yet to taste one which made me sit up and go wow until now the aburi salmon sushi is fabulous you can taste the smokiness of the seared salmon and it is not too overpowering the sushi has a good balance of fish and rice the presentation is good the premium chirashi is equally satisfying lots of fresh seafood and too little rice though the amount is just right to fill you up the premium chirashi has seasonal items uni prawn and maybe others which are not included in the regular chirashi and so is the price mine was   which i felt was reasonable given the  pieces of uni and sheer quantity of fish i loved the aburi salmon and salmon belly in it it is crowded during lunch time so you will need to wait to get a table they lost our reservation though so we took the counter seats until a table was free for a small place there are  people in the tiny kitchen slicing and dicing and cleaning it is a decent no frills sushi bar focusing on fresh and good food i will go back again oh you can also request for fresh wasabi which is  extra it is definitely better than the usual wasabi which is made from powder paste,Positive
the-sushi-bar,nice place for quality sushi business is good so it is advisable to make a reservation one of the speciality is the soft shell crab with salmon roll the salmon is torched so this dish is suitable for diners who are not into raw food the ingredients go well together the unagi avocado roll was a rip off in my opinion i understand that unagi is not cheap but not a lot of it was given and  pieces of sushi at   before tax were not worth it the other sushi rolls had more portions and value for money only cash or nets is accepted,Negative
the-sushi-bar,oh the sushi bar you had me at hello the sushi here is among the most mouthwatering and freshest you will find on the red dot furthermore it wo not break the bank either with the normal chirashi coming in at c sgd i am a rice and sashimi kind of guy hence my lifetime obsession with chirashi sashimi on a bed of rice the chirashi comes with an eclectic assortment of fish including salmon aburi salmon my personal fav tuna yellowtail swordfish scallop fish roe and tomago the fish portions are thick so you wo not feel short changed after finishing the dish my only complaint if any was the small layer of rice underneath the sashimi i am a huge sushi rice eater so this could be a personal complaint fortunately this was easily remedied by ordering an extra order of rice i am a huge fan of the sushi bar almost to the point of obsession the lines are long but it is worth the wait trust me,Positive
the-sushi-bar,stars for above average food at a price that is hard to beat the normal chiraishi comes with salmon aburi salmon tuna swordfish yellowtail and scallops they are really generous with the ingredients you get  thick slices of each quality wise i thought that it was on par with more expensive places like sushi tei or itacho sushi everyone orders the aburi salmon rolls and with good reason these were fantastic the salmon was perfectly seared and came in thick slices and the mentaiko mayo on the top of the rolls complemented the rest of the ingredients well for both dishes the fish rice ratio was   which was impressive considering that it is usually the reverse in similarly priced places wasabi was better than the usual but lacked the clears your nose immediately spiciness of the freshest kinds i should know because i put a teaspoon of it into my mouth and did not die i was here at pm on a weekday and it was empty none of the crazy queue that everyone is been talking about i do not usually do things like these it was part of a bet,Negative
the-sushi-bar,hole in the wall shop that is a hidden gem in fep came here to celebrate my friend is birthday and the food far exceeded my expectations there is a long line outside and all parties must be present to be seated but it is quite worth the wait they just opened a new outlet on level  of the same building but offers only  of the menu we opted to wait for a table and it only took min on a sat night at pm the salmon and salmon belly sashimi are generously sliced and rather fresh the famed salmon aburi roll did not disappoint while the sirloin steak was tender juicy fragrant and perfectly grilled it reminds me of the steak at new ubin seafood which i absolutely love we also had the upgraded miso soup some salmon fish head soup which was very sweet enjoyed my dinner very much and definitely looking forward to coming back again,Positive
the-sushi-bar,i would like to give   stars we had daikon salad fish miso soup udon seasonal chirashi and premium chirashi we loved all of the dishes except daikon salad chirashi was really good for this quality i think it is reasonable i just wish they would take credit card,Positive
the-sushi-bar,ok i get it now i understand why the queues here are out of control i have heard so much about this fabled no frills sushi place in the most random location inside far east plaza my husband and i are not the types to want to queue for food we would rather go to a place that is less crowded and costs more than to wait for cheap but satisfying bites luckily we had some time to kill on a saturday so we decided to give it a shot i ordered the aburi salmon roll and normal chirashi while miguel got the premium chirashi on the menu it mentions that the chirashis will be a  minute wait we get the aburi salmon roll first and mm mm mmm it was delicious melt in your mouth amazeballs however when the chirashis were delivered they immediately stole the show i felt like i was attending the funeral of all the fish from the sea aquarium look at how many dead beautifully cut up fresh fishes are in there i must admit that we came in medium hungry so we actually had trouble finishing our food no worries we eventually did as we knew it would be horrible to waste amazing fish like that but i am pretty sure if i came in hangry i would be fully satisfied after a chirashi aburi salmon roll i still would not wait more than  minutes in the queue for this place but i will no longer judge those who are willing to do so also one of us is the impatient type i wo not say who for dem basic bitches they also have a basic chirashi apparently the fish will be cubed instead of sliced,Negative
the-sushi-bar,this place was way more expensive than any of the dishes deserved we spent  cad between  people and we were not full,Negative
the-sushi-bar,randomly found this hidden sushi bar while walking around far east fish is really fresh love the salmon roll and seafood rice the store is now located on th floor instead of rd floor will return s soon for sure,Positive
the-sushi-bar,take away for this place is nice and fresh seafood a little pricey for what i have ordered fortunately overall taste was rather good ambience is what you would expect at sakei sushi watch the q so come early with all parties intact think you are better off ordering the individual bowls as that would limit the pocket hole from getting too big again fresh and thickly cut sashimi that saved the day,Positive
the-sushi-bar,patronise the far east plaza is outlet get ready to queue but ingredients are fresh and packs a punch it is rare to find quality and yummy food at a reasonable price at town but this is it lah they have a new outlet more upscale in ngee ann city,Positive
the-sushi-bar,i have been in search of a delicious yet decently priced sushi spot since our move to singapore thanks to yelp i think i have found it i just pulled up my yelp app typed sushi in the search bar and this spot popped up as a bonus it is only a couple of blocks away from our home my husband and i decided to meet for lunch so we decided to try the sushi bar we walked in a little after   and were seated immediately the service was very prompt and attentive we both ordered the miso soup it is the best miso soup i have had since moving to singapore we decided to split some rolls we ordered the spicy tuna maki soft shell crab and due to the yelp tips the salmon alburi roll the spicy tuna maki is a very simple roll but absolutely delicious it was probably my favorite roll out of the three the soft shell crab roll was wonderful as well it was also presented beautifully the salmon alburi was probably my least favorite of the three i did not love the texture but it was still tasty we left the sushi bar feeling full and satisfied the best part we only paid  sgd for  soft drinks  miso soups and  rolls we will certainly be back thanks for the suggestion fellow yelpers,Positive
the-sushi-bar,just go takes a bit of finding but well worth it best sushi i have had in a long time sashimi was great especially the tuna sushi was outstanding we got some basic rolls and loved them all this is not a fancy place but a great place for great food,Positive
the-sushi-bar,omg this has to be the best find for sushi in all of singapore you would not think much by the mall in which it is located but after a plate of the special nigiri two amazing salmon and scallop rolls and a bottle of wonderful sake you would think you had gone to heaven not to be missed if you are in singapore and need a serious sushi fix,Positive
the-sushi-bar,when the normal chirashi bowl was served to me i suffered a moment of amusement i could totally relate to how the fish felt packed slightly glistening and a fishy aroma surrounding me no one comes here for the ambience that is for sure the chirashi does offer a nice selection of fish a much nicer selection than some other places in fact but for some reason my go to chirashi place still remains mohamed sultan rd,Positive
the-sushi-bar,the sushi bar is tucked into a little corner of orchard road at far east plaza and if you do not already know about it you might just walk past it wondering why is the queue so long i came here for dinner ordering the famous salmon aburi sushi wagyu skewers salmon kabuto miso pot and the scallop carpaccio the ambience is definitely mediocre but the taste of the food is able to make up for it the prices are pretty reasonable unless you move up the scale and go for premium stuff that can set you back about   per person otherwise you can get away with about  per person they do not stinge on the portions and the food is worth the wait after you have ordered the crowd here tends to be young s to s and somehow you do not really see a matured crowd,Negative
the-sushi-bar,great food quick service not the cheapest eatery in singapore but the sushi was fresh and high quality per my husband and the cooked salmon was not overcooked always a concern and flavorful,Positive
the-sushi-bar,this is seriously one of my favourite places now i love aburi and reasonable pricing so yay haha they only take cash though maybe nets too cannot remember anyway big tip you can now do sms whatsapp reservations awesome there is always a long line when i go and then i am very thankful for having made a reservation lesson learnt from the first time we tried to walk in this gem is hidden in an obscure part of far east plaza i can never remember how to get there and end up wandering around the rd floor but just follow your nose p or else come up the escalators which are nearer to goodwood park as opposed to the escalators nearer to grand hyatt and i think it should be on that side aburi salmon roll   aburi scallop roll   scallop mentaiyaki   all the flame grilled goodness you could ask for and mayo although thankfully there is not an overabundance of it i think koh grill and sushi goes heavier on the mayo chirashi   is usually a gd deal too comes with a fair amount of fish and seafood  kind sashimi   pretty gd deal too fish slices are fairly large oh top up your own tea water service i mean no extra tax and gst you gotta serve yourself man,Positive
the-sushi-bar,delicious sushi with a great price range fresh fish quick service and a good price range nice atmosphere inside,Positive
the-sushi-bar,been back  weeks and i have read much about this place attempted twice to eat there but failed today finally had the chance to try the most talked about salmon aburi it was delicous but it didnt wow me i much prefer the yellowtail sashimi i ordered next time i would like to try the chirashi  service was fast and i am glad i went there before pm i sat pretty close to the other tables and i mostly heard praises from the others,Negative
the-sushi-bar,worth the long queue the crispiness of the soft shell crab really pumps up the flavors of the salmon aburi and moreover they fire grilled the salmon making extra flavors on top but still raw and fresh on the bottom,Positive
the-sushi-bar,queued for about  mins when i arrived there at pm aburi salmon roll creamy and melt in your mouth with a dollop of mentaiki sauce on top yummycalifornia maki roll good but nothing specialscallop mentaiki this was the best dish for me scallops were thinly sliced mentaiko sauce contrasted nicely with its richness salmon ikura rice bowl my boyfriend had this and thought this very average probably would not order again tofu cheesecake not as good as sun with moon is but decent a little too soft and runny total along with  beer was  for  pax,Positive
the-sushi-bar,fresh sashimi and rolls at very reasonable prices the aburi salmon rolls lived up to the hype attentive service and new modern space on the th floor will make me return again ignore having to walk through the mall to get to this tiny gem would like to return to try the spaghetti with roe and seared scallop carpaccio,Negative
the-sushi-bar,the aburi rolls here are spectacular the balance of ingredients and flavors and temperature is always just right even as takeout their aburi rolls still taste awesome if only they did not close so early and the wait was not so crazy,Positive
the-sushi-bar,yes the salmon aburi roll lives up to the hype it is delicious i have not tried the soft shell crab version though but i imagine that would be really good as well i love the sirloin steak always tender and tasty the sashimi is fresh and i like the thick cuts prices are definitely reasonable for the quality of food just be prepared to queue if you do not have a reservation this is definitely not fine dining so be prepared to squeeze i am impressed by the young chef behind the sushi bar and his team of young and enthusiastic staff cannot be too harsh on them given that it is really a small restaurant and it is always packed so i can understand when things like water tea does not get filled up with good japanese food at prices that wo not burn a hole in your wallet i am not complaining,Positive
the-sushi-bar,cosy awesome food and friendly chef what more can you ask from a sushi bar highly recommend the tuna yuke soft shell crab aburi sushi roll and sirloin price are affordable and portion fits just nice for me make sure to make bookings during weekend as they get really busy,Positive
saveur,in singapore for a little business and asked the concierge at the royalpark hotel on beach street for a lunch suggestion within walking distance without hesitation he asked if i like french me oui he recommended the set lunch which is also know back in the states as pre fixe out the door i went and it was about a  min walk super easy to find i got there around   on a tuesday and the place was about half full and i was immediately seated the set lunch is an amazing deal with  courses appetizer main desert for s  i ordered the escargot the duck confit and chocolate ice cream also on the set lunch menu you can add a glass of house pour wine red or white for an additional s  there were  escargot smothered in yummy garlic butter parsley sauce it was piping hot and so delicious served with some french bread slices to soak up all that leftover butter sauce wow the suck was everything i hoped for super crispy skin that actually cracked when you cut into it and fall aparty succulent duck it was served on a bed of oh so smooth mashed potatoes with mushrooms and a pan sauce on the side like i said before yummy the ice cream was a so rich just  scoop is all you need to satisfy your sweet tooth especially for lunch this place was legit french cuisine and the set price lunch is a steal of a bargain especially in singapore swing in by for lunch you can thank me later,Positive
saveur,i always make it a habit to seek out a french restaurant whenever i travel to another country ever since i had my first meal at cafe des artistes in manhattan at the age of  i have had a love for french cuisine while searching on yelp saveur came up on top after reading a few reviews what jumped out at me was when i read one reviewer say that you will not get an amazing prix fixe of  per person anywhere else in singapore other items are offered if you want to go off the prix fixe menu the place has stark white walls high ceilings and nice pop music playing in the background sing along if you want i did the place offers a nice acoustic the prix fixe menu offers a choice of an app entree and dessert my party of three got to sample each other is dishes here are a few of the dishes that really stood out escargot app foie gras app beef cheeks entree beef en croute entree creme brle dessert pistachio baileys panna cotta dessert here are my only two complaints the staff are the only people in singapore that we have encountered that were not as chatty they did not smile and were very robotic a bit surprising since everybody in sg seem overly friendly i read a review back in  and he said the same thing i guess the same staff has been working here for a long time my chicken dish was very dry the sauce had a bitter taste to it and did not go well with the chicken huge disappointment all in all if you are looking for french cuisine i highly recommend this place just do not expect the staff to smile at you,Positive
saveur,went here for a team event we had around  people the atmosphere is nothing fancy but tastefully designed and comfortable they have got some white walls and exposed white brick in certain areas overall nice aesthetics the menu has a great selection of various deliciousness ranging from lobster to foie gras for those less adventurous they have some pasta dishes with french fries whatever your taste you should not have any issues finding something delightfully tasty at this restaurant i had the lamb shank it was one of the most delicious meals i have ever had it was also a photogenic dish see below i have been with large groups dining at a restaurant and have seen the presentation suffer as a result of having to make multiple of the same dish that was not the case here the kitchen staff evidently takes pride in every dish that exits those kitchen doors great job the only thing i would approve is offering a more eclectic beer selection perhaps a craft beer or two with such a diverse and fanciful menu they should put more range on their drink selection great job,Positive
saveur,organised a group lunch restaurant decor is pretty and clean is not noisy staff passable service maybe a little slow but still polite food was good my frds had the duck confit they liked it i had the truffle mushroom soup i like it food delivery time from kitchen to us was ok too given it was not packed during lunch hour will go back again,Negative
saveur,food is so so price is quite affordable service staffs are not as friendly actually not impressive,Positive
saveur,saveur serves excellent french food at a very fair price   for a  course set meal over lunch or   for dinner i found the mushroom soup duck main course and pistachio dessert to be particularly excellent i also tried the pasta sea bass and creme brle sharing with a friend those were good too but not as exceptional no wait if you go right when they open at pm for lunch and pm for dinner would absolutely return here for another meal,Positive
saveur,as much as i like the idea of french cuisine becoming more accessible this did not really do it for me i know it is singapore but i found the service a bit absent and when the woman brought over my beer she did a terrible pour into a glass all head spilling way over onto the table she put down the beer bottle and walked off while i watched as it foamed everywhere no one grabbed a cloth for the table or glass no one apologised and i just waited in vain for it to settle food was a bit bland duck rillette was fine though accompanying bread was over oily main of fish was a reasonable size but again bland and felt unbalanced small fish steak too many potatoes not enough veges food did come fast though like i said wanted to like but walked away feeling unsatisfied maybe you need that extra level of care to make french food shine,Negative
saveur,we have since come back to this bistro many times for lunches and dinners over the years visiting singapore and we have enjoyable experience every time we just cannot get enough of its scrumptious duck confit among others especially with a glass of its house cab the food quality remains high service is adequate the price is slightly higher now but still of great value read on if interested peter apr this charming bistro is a gem it is conveniently located on purvis nearby the library and not far from the intercontinental hotel and the raffles hotel locals love it and try to keep it a secret tourists must go there and enjoy with its great food at value prices be prepared for a long wait but totally worth it go early its signiture duck confit is a must try this restaurant has an eye pleasing and comfortable caf style decor it offers a nice selection of tasty dishes at low prices s   beer and wine are expensive in singapore in general we found that its house cabinet sauvignon by the glass  goes well with the duck confit our local friends told us about this nice place last thur evening my wife and i got there well before pm the place was already almost full most of the diners were young folks we were lucky to get a table we had its famous duck confit seabass duck salad home fried potato cubes and a very small bottle of beer the duck confit was absolutely delicious however the seabass was way too bland and the fish was not firm the salad and potatos were tasty the service was not great but adequate when we left around pm the place was packed and there was a long waiting line outside we will definitely go back there and try other items on their menu before leaving singapore legend has it that the original saveur was a hawker in food court type of establishment after it was moved to the current location and became a nice french bistro its owner still keeps the prices and his profit low how nice of him its young chef has reportedly worked in top french restaurants wow i envy singapore people and especially their young yelpers peterskis jan,Positive
saveur,first impressions are so so anticipation had deflated as was so looking forward to eating at this establishment since it is been highly recommended by friends food was generally delish had the set dinner at   is quite reasonable started with the foie gras for appetizer followed by beef bourguignon as mains and chocolate with hazelnut sauce for dessert my friend ordered the angel hair pasta for  way sharing and loved it the foie gras lentils combination was a pleasant start lightly salted to balance the palate the beef was extremely tender an easy bite the stew was not too thick which i liked dessert was lovely though would liked more hazelnut sauce perhaps i was expecting too much though the food did not disappoint the service was barely there perhaps it was just a very casual dining place where service was kept at a minimal perhaps perhaps,Negative
saveur,the good the price of food and wine is extremely low although there is much better french food to be had in singapore it is very good given the low cost the tenderloin and boeuf bourguignon are pretty good the pork belly less so for the money the pasta appetizer and the potatos au gratin are very good the rillette not so much the bad no ambiance to speak of my first impression was that of a loud canteen i found it disconcerting to order using a paper form like you would see at a dim sum restaurant it is really loud it is hard to have a conversation or speak with the server even when the restaurant is only at half capacity let alone when it is near full the service is ok i think the service shortcomings are more because the restaurant is under staffed rather than rude or neglectful the wine list is shockingly brief two whites two reds the cabernet sauvignon was good for what it cost  we tried three different desserts the panna cotta the lava cake and the milk cookies unlike the appetizers and mains i think the desserts were quite poor with the milk cookies perhaps mediocre saveur has clearly identified its target market it is pretty well packed at dinner that said i do not think i would go back personally i would rather pay more and have a nicer quieter setting with better food,Negative
saveur,very nice food for the price will be one of my favs i think mushroom soup was probably my least favorite but loved the duck confit pasta etcthe venue is definitely loud but i think he wants it to be a casual place with it plastic seats and loud music it is still charming though,Positive
saveur,my friend brought me to this french restaurant and was disappointed to find out that the standard had dropped business did not seem good and we soon figured out why the french onion soup was not available which had happened during my friend is previous visit too our mains sea bass and duck confit came across as being cooked way in advance and just heated up when a customer places an order hope the place buck up and revive its glory,Negative
saveur,i really wanted to like this place s   for a  course meal great value in sg for sure however the food was mediocre and left no lasting impression the place is packed and loud it was almost as if i walked into a french version of caf de coral,Negative
saveur,best meal ever under  get here at pm or be prepared to wait in line the wife and i ate here twice  glasses of wine  duck salads  main dishes and a desert for  sgd the pork belly is done very well crispy skin moist meat tons of flavor everything was so good all the tables around us got the duck confit so it must be good wine was very good for  a glass a little small the chocolate hazelnut mouse was one of the best things i have ever eaten dense cold great flavor covered in frozen raspberries and rice crispy is for texture must order,Positive
saveur,i was in charge of picking a place for dinner so my favorite thing to do of course is find a place on yelp this place was only  blocks from our hotel we got here around  and there were lots of people waiting outside the hostess said it would be a   minute wait so we waited she would of called us when our table was ready but we did not have a phone we looked over the menu so we could order when we sat down wow the prices are amazing we ordered  foie gras since we cannot get it in ca we also ordered the pasta dish i got the duck confit and my husband got the beef tenderloin omg the foie gras was really good it melts in your mouth i preferred the one over lentils instead of the ones over apples the pasta dish was simple but had tons of flavor i liked how it had little bright pink dried shrimps on top of the pasta my duck confit arrived and we started eating that wow it was really good the duck was perfectly seasoned my husbands entree arrived and we tired his and it was good too we asked for medium but should have asked for medium rare it came out medium well but it was still good we finished our meals and decided to try the tofu cheesecake for dessert wow that was good too this is a great place for date night and good on the pocket too,Positive
saveur,i wo not say this is the perfect place to sample french food given the chop chop fast manner they serve the food and the lengthy queues you have to endure to get a seat the french way of dining is to relax enjoy and not to get your blood pressure up we headed over to the place at around  pm as the place opens at pm and they do not take reservations to our surprise there was already a queue of around  people and counting we joined the queue and was amused as there were more and more people commenting how surprised they were to see such a long queue when the place has not even opened yet finally at pm sharp the doors opened i felt like i was queuing to buy hello kitty or jay chou tickets we were seated promptly and in an orderly fashion hence our queuing neighbours in front and behind us got seated on our right and left respectively there was a mad rush to be the first one to place your order and i can already see the chefs hard at work preparing some of the more popular dishes i waved for the waitress to come over to take our order and she promptly did so the waitress frantically took our order much to the chagrin of the lady at the next table as she expected that it was common sense that the waitress turned around to take her order too anyway our order came pretty fast and we were generally satisfied with the meal which was affordable as well verdict forgive me as i forgot the name of the dish saveur is pasta apparently this is one of the more famous appetizers that people will order we ordered the main portion size and boy was it good beef cheeks with baked potatoes and musclun salad the  beef cubes though not as huge as i hoped for was so tender it literally melted in my mouth every bite was heaven the baked potatoes had all the comfort y goodness you can ask for though i must say that the dish itself is very fattening onion soup cannot compare to what we had in paris but i found the broth a tad too sweet for my liking overall plenty of onion bits to chew on dessert i cannot remember the name of the dessert but the waitress encouraged us to order this dish which she claimed to be have ry popular and takes  mins to make you should order this as once it is sold out there is no more see my picture for clarity very very nice dessert apologies again for the lack of a name tip expect to queue for at least  mins if you want to dine here do not expect to be served immediately or for the waitress to read your mind to head over to take your order common restaurant rules still apply expect to eat in a chop chop fast manner aka like order eat pay thank you mam style,Positive
saveur,affordable done right cannot complain the prices are all very reasonable for the area and i really appreciate the restaurant is efforts at giving customers a affordable way to taste great food quite a big fan of most of the starters soups and mains mushroom soup was delicious compared to the heavy cream based nonsense you usually tend to get elsewhere the duck confit was also pretty delicious and from what it seems is a crowd pleaser i personally loved the ebi shrimp and spaghetti starter as well super flavourful value for money for sure looking to enjoy some good quality food without breaking the bank this is the place,Positive
saveur,ok it is ok la tried the usual crowd favorites and they are decent but nothing mindblowing i can see this as a place among the youngsters for their date nights haha i find the servings really small that is how they keep their pricing low i supposed the foie gras came in hardly more than two bite size ok it is less than  but if you size it up the normal restaurant size it is not that much cheaper than the other places two of us ended up eating two appetizers two main course and two desserts it did not end up being a very cheap affair ultimately good effort by local young people who graduated from our own shatec though i wish them the best,Negative
saveur,guess how i found out about this place ding ding time is up here is the answer i got attracted by the long queue while crossing the road to bugis no seriously that was precisely how i found out about saveur i was like what the hell is with that queue and i dragged my poor boyfriend over to the crowd french food pfft that does not explain the queue then i saw the menu and everything became crystal clear duck confit for  are my eyes deceiving me i googled nope it is true it is actually affordable affordable french food somehow does not click but saveur made sure it did after a few unsuccessful attempts at trying to get in and eventually resigning to a certain golden arch fast food nearby for a meal the boyfriend and i did the unimaginable we went to saveur half an hour before opening hours to ensure we get in and we finally did so was the food worth the hype here was what we ordered the foie gras now do not go thinkin animal cruelty and all that it is not everyday i am getting foie gras at less than  with lentils was salty yes that was it salty but at less than  i am not complaining i will only be pissed if it was going for  what you pay for is what you will get after that my duck confit came ok granted it was on the smallish side but like what i mentioned before the price the taste of it for someone like me who hates the taste of duck i polished it off right down to the bone so i will say it is swell then the dessert of blood orange jelly came again it was on the small side one bite into it i swear if it was not indecent i would have orgasm on the spot what on earth the taste to me it was orgasmic a definite must try all in all was the food worth the hype the taste i will say it is average but the price yes it is definitely worth the hype if you are looking to go on a budget just remember though what you pay for is what you will get so do not be expecting too much from this place,Negative
saveur,i am a fan for such amazing taste french food with affordable price looking at the logo of the restaurant a duck i assume the duck is their specialty so i ordered the confit duck with orange the portion is just nice completed by the orange sweetness mushroom and mashed potato the duck dish is perfect highly recommended i tried the sea bass too and it is very delicious as well the place is quite big they even have spare room just next to it if more people come or for special reservations i came there with my parents to celebrate my mom is birthday so when i booked online i wrote my special request to have a birthday cake served for her at the end of our dinner the staff is very nice and they really make it happen the birthday cake turn out to be a chocolate mousse cake withe a written chocolate happy birthday on the plate wow very kind of them and they gave it as complimentary not to mention that the chocolate mousse taste very good too it is one of their desserts yumm for the dish yumm for the dessert i am satisfied and blessed,Positive
saveur,french food has always been one of my favourite cuisines and having read many reviews i decided to patronize this small restaurant tucked in a lane of shophouses along purvis street the french food here exceeded my expectations immensely for what it is worth not only is the food really cheap considering that the fact that french cuisine in singapore typically costs quite some bit of money it tastes really really good as well i ordered saveur is very own special pasta which was indeed a wise choice for an appetizer there is not much ingredients in this pasta but yet this pasta captures so much flavour i also ordered the duck confit for my main course which was splendid as well the duck was cooked to perfection and the sweetness from the fruit served with the duck complemented it is taste all in all i spent approximately  per person i am so glad that i managed to chance upon this quaint little place however it is indeed difficult to get a seat here if you are not early so my advice is that you go to the shop once it is open this place is more of a chill out place so it is great to bring your friends and join in the buzz in the shop,Positive
saveur,they are worth   instead during the middle ages the french diets and cooking techniques hardly changed unlike the current when more and more refined ones are notably seen in most restaurants a changed in the dietary norm shaping most palate of our era often haute cuisine has been highly thought of as highway robbery fair value estimated for its meticulous preparation and luxurious presentation some truth in it yes hardly less exorbitant anywhere except at saveur where prices are friendly less convincing it may be as we are taught to believe that lower expenditure equates inferior food quality and mediocre taste to prove otherwise saveur could be one that is worth experimenting simple casual but not missing out the con tempo the dining area was decked in a non flashy modish outfit with mascot distinctive wall paintings that backdrop the area nothing too fanciful as well the menu was kept to a minimal with  entree starters  plat principal mains with  extra side dishes  desserts plus  occasional special you could begin with a nice bread roll that comes with a butter spread barely  for as little as   i received a signature saveur is pasta for a decent portion approximately a size of half the mains amazing student elderly concession fare i have to agree that this pasta dish is a steal without compromising on its taste i feel good to be poked at when the chili oil smeared my lips while chewing the sakura ebi that capped the surface of that angel hair cooked al dente yelp com sg bizphotos s the foie gras on the other hand fared slightly inferior without any bit of crisp i could not read the contrast between its exterior and middle segment i have expected the searing to be slightly obvious on its upper cap but the whole duck liver turned out having a uniform smooth surface strips and diced apples were infused with port wine and vanilla pod to pair up the soft and melty organ good effort but will do more justice if the liver was richer in taste instead the least expected duck salad captured the most votes less interesting but the boring greens were made alive when you nibbled at those duck confit shreds the salty elements milder than a traditional duck confit mingled with a hint of tang from the lemon vinaigrette coupled with some zesty orange wedge cherry tomatoes and a few teeny quail eggs the composition was made to shine on the whole i would ditch the delicate foie gras and pick the fresh salad when i revisit barely   in exchanged for a   yelp com sg bizphotos s duck confit a salt cured piece of duck leg poached in its own fats for up to hours is one of the classic french dish saveur served a good portion of it without excessive greasiness tender but slightly dry in the meat well crisped skin without any flabbiness the magnificent crunch was accompanied by less fibrous shred of duck meat each time not overly rich or briny be ready for the aromatic compound emitted from the limb and get ready for the heap of homemade mashed potato which has been dribbled with orange infuse natural jus in circular fashion together with some saut shiitake mushroom orange segment as an accompaniment although less than stellar version it is still a respectable fried item for the price you pay   yelp com sg bizphotos s the pork belly scored a few points lower visible fats can be seen on its  sided walls with a golden blistered skin capping on top layers of fats were lined between each lean section giving its glossy appearance quite on par with the pork belly the sea bass was presented in its deep seared exterior waiting to shine in the crowd like a home cooked this fish reminds me of my mum is favourite dish in the kitchen  notches lower i rated the beef short rib critically braised in red wine the meat was faced with resistance when forked through and chewy in the mouth it did not seem that it has been undercooked and far less overcooked but i failed to recognise the rewarding fork tenderness short rib meat kind enough the beef jus was less greasy balanced and rich in taste lethal moment took place in the sweet intoxication outbreak the pistachio panna cotta outshone its peer sheer sweet but not cloying the green curd was made both creamier and nutty the chocolate hazelnut reminds me of the one i had at covelli italian bistro wine bar but a beet version a creamy and far from sticky mousse less intense chocolate flavour and dominated by its candied taste made using milk chocolate the piece is then met with a handful of sourish freeze dried raspberry bits to average out the overly sweet nature together with the crushed hazelnuts for some bite,Positive
saveur,cheap for a french food i finally went here after like a yr hearing about great reviews i would say yes food is okay but i would not queue for it i would say its good for the price if you want more authentic french food w a better quality of meat you have to go to diff places,Negative
saveur,as compared to the far east counterpart this place tend to turn around the tables faster so shorter waiting time the decor here is much plain and can get very noisy during meal hours definitely not recommended if u are bringing children other than that the food is decent and the price is reasonable if you do not get your food within min be sure to ask else u might not get it at all service standard is not great but understandable due to the large crowd and the fact that most waiter waitress are part timers recommend the duck confit foie gras and lava cake which i remember is only served at this joint enjoy,Positive
saveur,saveur must have been the best thing to happen on the french food dining scene in a long time there are long queues snaking outside the restaurant each time we walk or drive past during dining hours and when we finally got round to trying the food we were not at all surprised the price point undoubtedly is a huge draw quality french food at affordable prices we constantly scratch our heads and wonder how do they do it pan fried foie gras with lentils goes for   and confit of salmon goes for   both were highly commendable the duck confit was a bit on the dry side but for   we are not really complaining friends are big fans of the angel hair pasta with tiger prawns and lumpfish caviar but not so much of the beef bourgignon which does not come in a stew like we were expecting but as a steak like dish the desserts are pretty amazing we love the textures of citrus and chocolate mousse with hazelnuts yum go early to queue as they do not take reservations,Positive
saveur,overall the food did taste good had the foie gras for starters which was great for the mains my friend had the steak and i went with the roasted chicken both were good had the chocolate hazelnut for desert again very good the prices really are affordable thought the serving sizes do suffer somewhat went with the chicken cause from what i have seen of the food served on tables beside us if i went with anything else i an average sized man would leave the place hungry the place is in a good location that is convenient and accessible poor service though ordering using a paper sheet had to ask for a couple of waters server brought them over by grabbing them wholesale by the top asked for other ones that were not touched that way the server shot me a look that basically said how else am i supposed to carry them the persistent non usage of trays by servers in singapore continues to baffle me no fresh cutlery between courses used the single napkin that the cutlery usually sits upon when the table is set provided to put in my lap when clearing the first course the server put the dirty cutlery out of my plate and directly onto the table in all fairness the food did come quickly though they were out of about  of their wines by the glass on the evening we were there the ones they did have were reasonably good though mixed bag this place is,Positive
saveur,a rather large crowd even on a weekday evening people started streaming from  pm onwards and both units were filled to the brim by pm they did not allow reservations but did have a waiting list for you to put your name and number down they also had a policy of only seating groups with more than  of the headcount present the most popular dishes seemed to be the confit of duck with orange segments and saut shittake and angel hair pasta with sherry minced pork and sakura ebi so we ordered those we also added an order of crispy pork belly with poached egg and diced vegetables the angel hair pasta arrived relatively quickly first impression it was such a tiny serving but i guess its reasonable at   my friend commented that the sakura ebi was just a nice name for what we singaporeans would usually refer to as hay bee though haha the wait for the other two dishes was much longer but i was appeased when the duck confit arrived looking was absolutely delicious i was a huge fan of entire dish from the duck to the sauted mushrooms the skin was crispy while the meat remained tender a must order for me the crispy pork belly was a disappointment though the skin seemed to be a little over cooked prices were certainly affordable for a restaurant of this standard the staff were also helpful and our glasses were constantly refilled overall a good place for affordable food,Negative
saveur,i visited this quaint little french bistro after hearing friends rave about it for a few weeks french food for less than  i am on a word of advice though be prepared to queue for up to  minutes during peak hours my friend and i ordered the angel hair pasta with tiger prawn and lumpfish caviar and mesclun salad with lemon vinaigrette and crispy duck as starters the pasta was delicious and we gobbled it up pretty quickly but the duck salad was not so appetizing the meat was dry and the salad was really oily for mains she ordered the confit of duck with orange segment and saut shittake while i ordered the beef bourgeon with root vegetable and mixed green she enjoyed her dish but i did not particularly enjoy mine as the chunks of beef were very fatty when i was expecting something more tender we both shared the pistachio panna cotta which was the perfect finish to our meal definitely order this if you are a fan of nuts the dishes at saveur are a hit or a miss but at these prices there is not much to complain the long queue is a turn off though so i would probably only return to this place when its hype dies down,Positive
saveur,headed out for a friday night dinner with a couple of good friends and was impressed by both the food and the price had a delicious sea bass with truffle mash on the side and it was tasty the salted caramel lava cake was pretty delicious too main and dessert for  people plus a bottle of wine came to s  so fairly decently priced too i will definitely be going back it was pretty busy so make sure you make a reservation and do show up on time we were told they would only hold the table for  mins past our reservation otherwise they would give it away to one of the groups lines up outside waiting to get in,Positive
saveur,appetizer  mains value overall  god has blessed this merry little place indeed we had a party of  for a tues night it was completely full up by pm they were extremely accomodating despite a friend being over  min late appetizer saveur is art pasta it tasted average neither good nor bad like some well seasoned maggi mee the bits of mushroom elevated it slightly not highly recommended but for  get this primi secondi the entire table got the duck confit so i sampled some for  it is a steal seriously it was  as good as the  stars serve in paris tu te rends compte instead i got the beef bourguignon and it did not disappoint one bit perfectly cooked well balanced wine broth with those caloric rich french grilled potatoes side just wow could not ask for more,Positive
saveur,french food with hawker centre prices and attitude to match ordered the confit de canard duck confit the skate special foie gras with apple infused port wine and vanilla bean and creme brulee great food at an awesome price the duck was suitably crisp the skate stingray well marinated and creme brulee well executed at this price point it explains the queue snaking out the door and extremely long wait time you cannot expect too much of the ingredient quality and i noticed a couple of ingredient substitutions along the way minus one star for the bee gees greatest hits on repeat and for the surly attitude otherwise a worthy contender and a place i would try again perhaps on a weekday evening,Positive
saveur,good food for good price we got a course meal and the both taste and price were good the food was a bit too salty so that you do not really taste the ingredients as opposed to higher end restaurants where you really taste the good quality ingredients but that is given considering their price point overall it was good and i would go back overall verdict taste amount price atmosphere,Positive
saveur,this place is really awesome best food i have had in a long time last time was probably quince in the sf which is in a price level dishes at   is probably one of the best value quality food you can get in singapore and singapore has lots of great food only complaints is we did not make a reservation and had to wait for  minutes for a table no creme brulee and wine was not that good,Positive
saveur,from a humble stall in joochiat to its hip new joint at purvis street across big boys like gunther is and garibaldi saveur has certainly come a long way the long queues are proof of the quality of the food serving up french fare made with local produce that tastes divine i have to say that almost everything on the menu should be sampled and even though it is packed nightly wait time for the food is pretty decent matter of fact if you want to dine at saveur you best be there early or you might not have a table i have had to leave twice because they were simply too full reservations are a no no so get there early,Negative
saveur,recommendation from a friend i have recently moved to singapore very casual and shorts go all the way here smal menu and in my view takes away the fuss from ordering they have a set menu also went with ala carte had the pork belly truffle mash with a pretty good cabernet sauvignon from france not expensive either  sgd for  dishes and  glasses of wine one person pretty good will be back soon with friends and family,Positive
saveur,update went back for a third time and i have confirmed that this is one of the best bang for buck places in singapore  courses plus drinks for under  bucks not to mention the vast majority of the dishes are c est bon on top of that the service is attentive and despite this being a busy place they actually do a good job of getting people in and out therefore it has been bumped up from a  to a  star rating,Positive
saveur,i am not one to follow the herd in my day job and general life choices but i have to say saveur is a crowd pleaser spartan but decent cervenza list super bock unobtrusive dressing and well tossed salad check and check and i am still reeling from the shock of finding a restaurant that knows how to pick out wilted leaves and not slobber dressing my roast pork belly was not bad but not mind blowing like at hellenika or my atit is awesome babi guleng i liked the sweet lentils and poached eggs as accompaniments smells like there is some schooled chefs in the kitchen dude had the duck and his comments were similar to mine best part we are talking quality food at prices that allow you to not share my wallet chimed in how crazy is that in singapore the waitresses were attentive the check was fast when we asked for it and there is a semblance of a wait list system this is one place where the line outside the door makes absolute complete sense and it is not because of hello kitty folks,Positive
saveur,french food on the budget is always good been going back there so often over the last  weeks first off i really enjoy the pastas each time i was there i always ordered a serving of each of the two pastas for once pasta minced pork paste coats the pasta nicely and the saltiness of the dried shrimp gives it that extra edge the other pasta came with bits of tiger prawns and lumpfish caviar i always remove the caviar first so that i can ration it as i go along too good to be mixed into the pasta of course the signature main dish is the duck confit crispy skin lovely mash happy days i also ordered the beef bourguignon and it was very well cooked the meat was tender and flavourful and i enjoyed it very much,Positive
saveur,five stars for proving good and affordable french food in singapore the central location is also another big plus the duck confit and the chocolate mousse were both really good and definitely worth the price we asked the service staff to suggest which wine we should get and although the staff did not know a single thing about the wines they were serving she went to get a taster for us without us even asking for it this totally impressed me she may not actually know the wine a big boo boo if this is an expensive place but quite acceptable for a casual eatery in singapore but the way she went that extra mile for us was absolutely great so another big plus for the service a must try,Positive
saveur,one of the best i have been to in singapore the menu is simple but the food just tastes great the duck confit is a must try,Positive
saveur,affordable tasty french food mon dieu what a find i have been going to saveur to eat since their humble beginnings in a roadside coffeeshop in joo chiat they had a limited menu and even more limited seating space but they are food is great and affordable and so they have done so well they have expanded and moved to purvis street i went to saveur to see if their standards had been maintained and was pleasantly surprised to see that their menu has also expanded with them to include more dishes i really liked the ambience and interior at the new saveur it is well lit and well spaced so diners do not feel too cramped together the service is alright but i did not really care about that i needed to know if the food was still incredible and affordable i ordered the angel hair pasta with tiger prawn and lumpfish caviar which was flavoursome but light and satisfying as an appetizer however they did stinge on the prawns and it came with tiny bits of prawn which left me a little disgruntled i also had a small fois gras here you can have the option of a large portion of  grams or a smaller one at  grams and found it a little overcooked and dry so that was disappointing and for my main i had the signature duck confit with orange and mushrooms that did not disappoint one bit it was tasty and tender with the complementary oranges and sauce on a bed of potato mash the duck skin was very crispy but not oily and the meat was not gamey at all all up the meal cost me about  which is very cheap will be back to try their other dishes my food came quite quickly despite it being full house that day make sure you come early as the queues during peak hour get quite ridiculous so be prepared to wait for a table and then for your food,Positive
saveur,got here late and there was no queue around   sunday had beef b and  choclate hazelnut dessert great great food and nice atmospheare staff friendly but quite disorganized and unattentive will come back for sure,Positive
saveur,how i wish i had the duck confit despite trawling through all the reviews that recommend the duck i decided to have the fish saveur offers french food to the masses at reasonable prices the small but filling meals highlight the simplicity of french food with complex flavours only negative is the wine list out of the  listed only  were available and they were not french wines either shock horror my fellow dining partner is a bit of a wine connoisseur and politely enquired about the average at best wine after returning  glasses that he deemed undrinkable after a lot of genuine apologies by the waiter and the owner they look both glasses off the total bill being courteous he declined but thought it was very kind of them despite the lack of wine the food is amazing if only this place was byo it would solve the wine issue tip book before the lines can be crazy and do not be put off having to wait   minutes for a table because its well worth it,Negative
saveur,granted we came before they were about to close most of the dishes were not available or sold out also we had found a hair in one of the dishes not cool the food itself was not too bad however the portions are small which reflects the pricing yes affordable however you really do pay for what you get paying for bread and butter just add an extra  into the main dishes and provide the bread and butter please it felt a bit like ordering off a menu from a budget airline to be honest most likely will not be back sorry,Negative
saveur,incredible duck confit crispy on the outside moist and juicy on the inside but the mashed potatoes that the duck was sitting on was so good it almost stole the show away from the duck itself if that is not filling enough for you pair this with the angel hair pasta at only     good food tastes better when it is value for money no,Negative
saveur,this place is seriously understaffed it is my first visit here and yes there is always a crowd but having charged for ice water you had to asked for it to be topped up that is is if you can get the attention of a server wines too they never come round to ask if you would like another round desserts etc it is like just eat up and go kind of place zero ambience and noisy too of course the only saving grace is that it is very affordable french food the duck confit i though was too dry maybe it is not a good day for the chef beef bourguignon was good enough though did not try the desserts as we decided to go somewhere else portions a little small both for food and wine good place for an introduction to french cuisine just temper your expectations and put the money saved in your piggy bank for your next meal at les amis,Positive
saveur,for full reviews and more pictures visit my blog saveur is known as the decent and highly affordable french food for the masses in singapore since their humble beginnings at the ali baba eating house i am serious in katong the young chefs have gone a long way and have even made a mark for themselves at purvis street my friend said that they have expanded from their original store front the next store in order to meet the demands of the customers for starters we had the signature saveur pasta tossed with chili oil fine chopped japanese konbu and sakura ebi with minced pork sauce   this is the italian version of our local minced pork noodles the texture of the angel hair pasta makes it more delicate than its fat mee pok cousin kind of reminded me of iggy is signature cappellini of course every cents count towards the quality but this is not too shady from the special menu the seafood pasta with tiger prawn and lumpfish caviar   is also a crowd pleaser perfectly al dente noodles which is well flavored by the natural seafood sweetness the taste is lighter than the signature pasta and the spring onions gives each mouthful a refreshing burst when you bite into them prawns are a wee small though but it is only   if you want something smaller perhaps pick from the  different pan seared foie gras one served with creamy lentils and pickled pearl onion   and the other with apples infused with port wine and vanilla bean   i was not too much of a fan of their foie gras as it was on the grainy and powdery side la petite is another cheap french place at serene centre and thomson tasted better in my memory duck confit   is their hot favorite the flatted and pan fried duck leg was served atop homemade mashed potato with saute shiitake mushroms orange segments and orange infused natural juice i like that the meat was not too salty or dry and the creamy thick mash helped to give it a little moisture it may look small but i was very satisfied even after giving s a few bites of my dish the pan seared sea bass with diced saute potato,Positive
saveur,went there for lunch on a friday with great expectations cos there were so many good reviews about this place today is experience was kind of disappointing for me i have to agree that for the price to pay the serving portion and variety of food is truly not too bad this is especially so for the foie gras love it likewise for the angel hair pasta however i have definitely had better duck confit what made today is experience negative was the whole confusion of order we ordered  appetizers to share and an entree of duck confit each after waiting for sometime the  entrees arrived and there were no appetizers served that left us confused and upon asking the servers checked and then served up the angel hair pasta promptly   through the meal they then served our other appetizer but instead of the foie gras that we ordered they served us a salad after checking again we were about   through our entree when the foie gras finally arrived the quality of the food commensurates to the price payable but since we are also paying service charge i would expect the service to be slightly better since long queues are such a problem and the servers and kitchen get flustered with all the overload of orders the restaurant operations may want to rethink on this issue to manage the flow of customers vs quality of service i would not mind going back again cos it is value for money but perhaps only after the craze and fad slows down so at least the service will match up to their quality of food,Negative
saveur,as this was a visit last year in september the menu is likely to have changed slightly now but still worth it to spread the good word with everyone as fish lovers our main courses were of course fish the pan fried monk fish is quite a rare sight in french cuisine but this was executed well with interesting combination of cabbage leek fondue and monk fish jus it was chewy or slightly rubbery but it was the slabs of golden brown potato which left me with a deep impression till today the barramundi with crab potato and french beans did not shine as much as the monkfish the salted crust did not conceal the dry flesh and it was a relatively small portion but one wonders why the cubed potatoes are called crab potatoes we could not miss this sakura ebi angel hair pasta   as it was one of their signature dishes the verdict was that it tasted quite average as the pasta was not fully al dente i guessed it was the aroma of the sakura ebi and minced pork that rescued the dish perhaps the strength of saveur lies in their desserts than mains this chocolate and hazelnut is a must order for chocolate fans we had it at   but seems like the price has gone up other desserts include pistachio pudding and their special dessert of the day which consists of apple risotto cinnamon puff pastry caramel biscuits soil cheese yoghurt foam toffee jelly celery and apple ice so long right haha the ambitious plating style that resembled fine dining desserts was commendable but too many stuff on one plate confuses the diners,Negative
saveur,saveur is a french restaurant that probably serves the most affordable french cuisine i have ever seen the menu is simple and not exactly extensive but the chef is good at what he does and prepares each dish with special care upon stepping into the restaurant i peeked at the other tables and saw the duck confit dish on almost every table so i told myself i had to order one too this top seller is indeed amazing the exterior was crispy and the meat inside was juicy and succulent the mashed potato heap that the duck was lying on top of was creamy and buttery as well complementing the flavors of the duck not only that there were sauted mushrooms and orange segments on the side too all for only   i must say that happiness here sure comes cheap for dessert i ordered the pistachio panna cotta that was light yet creamy at the same time definitely fulfilling the service was a tad slow but the good food made up for it,Positive
saveur,i had assumed the quality would commensurate with the price but to my surprise every dish was amazingly executed three of us shared an appetiser had a main each and shared  desserts all yummy and authentic french cooking for  appaluse,Positive
saveur,this place is pretty solid if you really like french fare but you hate the long pretentious dinner style and you do not mind a loud ambience noise environment this place is all about the food and they do it gloriously the entrees are all cheap for french food my friend got the famous duck confit and it was really well done crispy skin moist and tender meat on top of a pillow of bouchon worthy mashed potatoes   potato butter i had the angel hair pasta but i am not sure if it was the intention but it kinda tasted like asian ta mee the flavor was great do not get me wrong but there is something about a tiny prawn infused oil sauce that screams asian it was still tasty just not what i was expecting the foie gras for  bucks was very decent like i said a place with value for money grub better to go in twos than fours i only spent  min waiting on a thursday night,Negative
saveur,i decided to try something a little different during my trip to singapore french cuisine at hawker prices in a cool clean setting sure sounds great when it was absolutely sweltering hot outside started with the saveur pasta i thought this was delicious perfectly al dente and i liked the addition of chili flakes gave the dish some heat like many reviews have stated the duck confit is a must the chicken roulade was ok i was not crazy about my dish and regretted not ordering the duck confit myself service was quick and by the time i left around pm the place was filled with working locals in the area for the quality and value of the food this place is definitely  stars,Positive
saveur,delicious and cheap mushroom soup came in this little cup and looked entirely like a cappuccino foam and all duck salad   nice citrusy dressingsaveur pasta   aglio olio with gd al dente and savoury touch with the little shrimps hae bi main courses looked a bit small but were tasty too duck confit   and chicken w risotto   desserts yum i think the pistachio panna cotta was the star   very creamy and pistachio tasting textures of citrus   was nice and light very refreshing for a hot day chocolate hazelnut   was okay fairly rich and creamy as compared to the other two i liked the chocolate tuile that came with it,Positive
saveur,i was told that saveur is an affordable french restaurant wait what affordable and french do not go together the general opinion seems to be divided half the people love it half think it is overrated so i went with my friends and our verdict not bad at all we tried the foie gras   if i remember correctly and it was really good but do not laugh at me i am not really a big fan of foie gras and maybe it is an acquired taste all i can say is that for such a price the foie gras was really quite decent i also tried the much raved about duck okay this one really impressed me because i am also not a big fan of duck but wow the meat was tender and flavorful but what really made me fall in love with the dish was the mashed potatoes and the mushrooms love and all for a steal at   my friend had the chicken at   but when it came she was shocked because it is so small there were maybe   slices of chicken on a bed of rice she finished it so quickly and i could tell she was quite dissatisfied that is why i gave saveur  stars the portions are too small if i bring my boyfriend here he has a huge appetite a main would not fill his tummy at all but i guess we get what we pay for and we will still return cos the angel hair pasta appetizer that almost every other table had looks yummy my other friends also had the duck so i would say avoid the chicken unless you are seriously on a budget or a diet also we went at pm so there was no line but after awhile the place was packed and the line was never ending so go early if you do not wanna wait too long idk if saveur takes reservations please check out my blog on my profile for photos,Negative
saveur,good french food at very affordable prices however you will need to que the place opens at  but you would need to start queing at   to get the first seating on a weekend i usually order the froe gras as a starter you can choose the  gram portion or the  gram portion for the mains is either have the duck confit or the crispy pork belly with  degree egg both are very well executed and taste fantastic however the one item which i find that cannot be passed is the pistachio panna cotta other pistachio desserts have this strange almond medicinal taste to it however here that smell is very light very pleasant the crushed pistachio and sea salt on top adds a salty crunch crunch to the dessert a good contrast to the smooth sweet custard underneath very very good,Positive
saveur,one of the best bets for the price get there early or you are wait an hour plus for a seat service is slow i had to start stacking water glasses into a tower in order to get someone is attention only to have them take them away and still not take our order duck confit was excellent only drawback is the slow service,Positive
saveur,this place is fantastic casual affordable fusion cuisine with a very hip young crowd we tried the saveur pasta lobster pasta duck confit and barramundi and they were all delicious portions are on the small side but sized perfectly so you are just full enough at the end of your meal service is friendly but as with any restaurant can get spotty during peak times do not let the long lines deter you saveur is a fun fresh place to experience a unique aspect of the singapore dining scene and should not be missed,Positive
saveur,affordable french store sa veur has up and moved from joo chiat to purvis street early this year and are offering a wider menu range to tickle your tastebuds and while the queues have gotten longer and wait times are now crazy its still not enough to deter me from having my dinner there my favourite is the angel hair pasta with tiger prawn and lumpfish caviar if you plan to eat it as a main you would probably have to order  portions of it the other must haves is the duck confit with orange segment and saut shitake and chicken chicken roulade with foie gras stuffing and basmati rice the desserts are pretty awesome as well we ordered to wonder of berries that came with caramel sauce chocolate mousse and ice cream with berries which was big enough for two to share but too sweet for my liking unfortunately bookings are unavailable and the restaurant entertains walk in customers only i would advise everyone to be there early as by  pm all tables will be booked up for the rest of the night,Positive
saveur,food is all right price is all right two bucks for two tiny rolls is too much there are better place where you could get much better food for just a bit more buck,Negative
saveur,really good for the price i had the foie gras duck confit and braised short rib everything was pretty good i am not going to pretend it was life changing but everything was solid the service was pretty good for singapore i have had a ton of mediocre meals for way more money the food was satisfying french fare,Positive
saveur,not too bad the seabass lacks some flavor but tasted fresh the garden salad was very good atmosphere was a breath of fresh air from all the hawker stands and busy mom pop restaurants,Positive
saveur,loved the duck confit and pistachio panna cotta as well as the angel hair appetizer with dried shrimp this place does get busy but soo worth the wait at such an affordable price,Positive
saveur,my partner and i had the foie gras and saveur pasta for starters as well as duck confit and the fish sea bass for mains the food was above average and value for money however chances are you will have to wait for your table and to be served as they seem pretty popular the only thing that ticked me off was waiting more than half an hour for dessert which i ultimately cancelled in the end,Positive
saveur,this restaurant proves that pretty much all other singaporean restaurants charge too much it was delicious and cheap it reminded me of chartier in paris which is very impressive i will come back probably often,Positive
saveur,great prices and great food it is a really nice little restaurant tucked away on purvis st some might call this place cute i call it convenient it is great for dates although i have never been on a date here because the food is extremely well priced but you still get the nice ambiance my favorite dish here would have to be the duck confit tip expect a long wait unless you are a table for  you might be waiting for up to  minutes or just go early,Positive
saveur,at two steps from the national library this place looks completely unremarkable from the outside only the queue that starts building about minutes before opening time can give you a inkling that there is something special and yes there is this place has a short menu  starters   main courses two types of wine by the glass that is largely french italian inspired but that also shows some bright local inspirations i had angel hair sort of alio olio but with a twist i still do not know what the twist was but it was good sakura ebi paste followed by pork belly perfect melting in the mouth with a poached egg and on a bed of lentils my colleagues had boeuf bourguignon which looked a bit predictable the prices are unbeatable and come to about  sgd per person no reservations but you really have to make sure you are there in time for the queue one negative note for some reason this place is very popular with young women nothing negative about that and that makes the noise level go up a few notches,Negative
saveur,amazingly reasonable prices for good french fare menu a little limited and we had to wait a while for a table since it does not take reservations but worth it the beef bourguignon was tender and flavourful and the duck confit was just the right level of salty,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,fresh bagels made everyday worth it for its price a bagel and coffee works perfectly on a sunny weekday,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,my fav bagel place in singapore at this location i like the spam bagel i recommend adding a hash brown usually i do that for my husband cos he loves hash browns but it is good enough on its own i also like the avocado one sofrito and add a slice of bacon if you feel like it otherwise i go for the blueberry bagel with fruits my go to breakfast place in my hood,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,been to their other branch thought try this one since its focus is smoked tried the primal and ribs and both were wonderful though the ribs was a little too spicy coffees were wonderful as usual only issue was the order payment was slow otherwise q as usual even before the store opens,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,i have to say i was skeptical coming from nyc we know good bagels and this place really delivered excellent bagels got a cheddar bagel with scallion cream cheese and my husband got the whammer on a garlic bagel and both were great definitely recommend,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,eighteen days into a three week swing through asia i was done with hotel breakfast buffets i wanted a breakfast that had not been under a warming light or in a steam tray fortunately when i checked into the delightful courtyard by marriott novena the young lady at the bell desk on the ground floor told me i had to try this place given that it was about  steps from the front door this was a no brainer this was just what i needed and more the bagel at  am was still warm from the oven and the schmears were cool and tasty the menu told me that i was coming back and tomorrow i am buying for the office two men bagel house has redefined the quick breakfast in singapore as long as they are here i am staying nearby,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,it is my first time in singapore so i do not really know a lot of places to eat thankfully i have yelp to help me out i ordered the kuzu bagel and it was very delicious i also like their unique maneki neko,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,waited  minutes for them to open and it was definitely worth the wait got a breakfast bagel that was phenomenal very friendly staff too,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,this place is great before you ever order your food drink you are greeted by a happy friendly helpful staff the bagels are fresh and delicious they make them fresh each morning there are all sorts of choices to make a sandwich or just have a topping or two the coffee is delicious as well my only regret is not having eaten here sooner we ate breakfast here before heading to the airport if i am ever back in singapore i will make a point to come back here,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,when coffee meets bagels coffee we have plenty in sg bagels well they are indeed rare and hard to find good coffee yesgood bagels probably the best in sg and for coffee to meet bagels here in novena automatic  stars when they first popped up in tanjong pagar many yelpers were lavishing mouthwatering praise our previous cm michelle even got them to tie up with the new black for a yelp event and all who attended were sold on how good they are and craved for more that culminated in us holding a subsequent uye brunch at their tp location not so long after cold retarded no not you the dough handrolled boiled in honey water flavoured and then tanned in the oven on site for a freshness that cannot escape the bite need something extra toasted and schmeared for extra taste and texture still looking for that something extra the legends and the breakfast club configurations will take that to the next level be it savoury or sweet meaty or plant loving there is something fishy too nicely stacked halved and wrapped maximum enjoyment minimum messiness a favourite with the expats and millenials non airconditioned but who needs it with the recent cold spells in sg the staff will definitely warm you up with their cool attitude and infectious friendliness my only wish is for the onion and garlic flavours to make it is way here from enggor st and the coffee meets bagel experience will be complete,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,a rather refreshing take to bagels never thought bagels could be so savoury and so wholesome love the bagel with spam tastes amazing with all the luncheon meat goodness thumbs up also to their in house roasted meats the birdie chicken bagel was incredible fragrantly roasted and well seasoned the meat platter had very generous portions and all of it together formed a very heavy lunch that filled us to the brink just wished that we did not have to go back to work with such a full stomach after that the mango smoothie deserves a special mention for it is refreshing taste with just the right amount of sweet and chill to balance the meaty tastes all set in a casual alfresco dining experience for cosy chit chat with friends enjoyable,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,amazing bagels i have never actually had any other bagels in singapore so i feel pretty comfortable saying that these must be the best that the island has to offer i normally always spring for the lox bagel but the menu is so inventive and interesting that i decided to try something a little different the hawaiian bagel spam chutney egg sriracha aioli greens no cheese for me because i really do not like it all on an onion bagel it was easily was of the messiest bagels i have ever eaten but also one of the best comparable to the one i have had in new york just everything was perfect the onion bagel was crispy and just the perfect amount of onion the spam chutney etc combination was really great and tasty everything tasted fresh which is weird to say about spam but you know everything else tasted fresh i was kind of sad my bagel was over i know i mentioned their menu was interesting but i definitely feel it warrants another mention i have not gone to a bagel place with such a wide offering it is usually pretty boring typical stuff but two men bagel house offers so much more i mean corn chowder soup bagel like what even give me some of that and who the hell does not want to eat something called hot mess i legit wish i had more time to stick around and try something else i almost forgot to say though you order up front and then grab a seat the staff at the counter were hilarious as well cracking jokes with us really great service and made for a good atmosphere,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,highly recommend not a big fan of bagels but this little place changed that no doubt it was made just a few minutes earlier it was so fresh just wish i would have discovered them when i first got here instead of on my last day here coffee beans were fresh and very flavourful they use a local roaster and the roast date for your coffee is shown mine was within the last  days so just about perfect to top it off every staff member was super nice and accommodating a rarity it seems breakfast lunch or dinner would be great here,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,what caught my eye about this place was the honey and ricotta spread i love honey and i love ricotta but i have never thought to put them together on a bagel the taste was absolutely mouthwatering and the ice peppermint tea i will be back for,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,still the best bagels in singapore this one alongside their other location in my old stomping grounds in tanjong pagar serve the only bagels in singapore that i consistently come back to highly recommend you come here for any bagel craving you have as you really wo not find any better on the island the location is pretty cool all outdoor or bar like seating they do not take credit cards so be wary of that only cash and nets,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,had the primal and lamb bagel for someone that is not hugely into bagels my verdict is well i loved it they were huge and cut in half so my wife and i were able to try both coffee was good had a long black they have cold pressed juice and everything was ready in a little over  minutes people working there were nice and friendly,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,awesome bagels thank you we love coming to this shop especially the bagel and lox or the bbq,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,went there yesterday and this place is legit although i am a goy so take this with a grain of salt speaking of salt the lox was not salted but was piled deliciously high on your choice of bagel along with tomato onions cucumbers cream cheese and capers seating is outside only covered coffee was good but not great right next to the courtyard entrance,Positive
two-men-bagel-house,i had the primal bagel and it was delicious the bagel was soft the staff were friendly and explained to me in details since it was my first time eating there,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,bunch here is supposedly legendary so i went and had the chicken and waffles and was not disappointed i prefer the dinner selection though regardless of meal time get their house made burrata you will only be able to say wow after he first bite trust me it is a very casual hipster atmosphere with a short wine list sit outside on a nice night or inside if you have a group the bar tables inside are not comfortable however,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,it just was not as good as i remembered most of the dishes were not memorable bag of turkish bread    starsthe bread tasted great but there were only about  small pieces per bag so we needed maybe    bags per person which adds up also makes me wonder why we have to keep ordering bread hummus iraqi spiced mushrooms    starsone of the better dishes spinach labneh fried onions sugar plum   starshonestly nothing special tasted like creamed spinach but not a very flavourful version either crab toast chicken crackling trout roe   starsthis was disappointing two tiny macaron sized pieces with a filling that tasted too much like salmon spread from a tin fried cauliflower mango amba pine nuts red cabbage    starsone of the best dishes of the night the cauliflower was deliciously salted and breaded and the dressing was tasty cuttlefish shawarma chicken fat dressing lime    starsthe texture of the cuttlefish was excellent not too rubbery and grilled just right but how is a chicken fat dressing anything less than flavourful green harissa prawns split cream charred onions    starsthis came with four large prawns cooked right and a delicious spicy harissa that was wonderful for dipping bread into malabi ruby peach pudding bergamot ice white chocolate    starsthe flavours just did not go well together the white chocolate on top seemed gimmicky and the bergamot was too sour i enjoyed the pudding but it was par for the course date pudding smoked milk cashew caramel coffee jelly   starsthe date pudding was delicious and so was the crunchy cashew caramel on top i enjoyed the coffee jelly yes but it seemed a little out of place we tried to make a reservation for a saturday night but they were fully booked so we walked in at  pm and managed to get a table i called multiple times and wish their automated voice system online system would show that they were fully booked i was not sure if it was not taking same day reservations or if it was fully booked,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,went for dinner on a weekday great vibe and great music most importantly great food everything we had was delicious so i will simply list everything we had and all dishes are best to be shared for mezze we had babaganoush paired with the pita bread rich but yummy had some cured swordfish and fresh figs with goat cheese which were both really refreshing would suggest ordering mezze to start they are small dishes for   people for sides we had the feta burrata broccoli salad and the green beans and beet could pass on these but it is nice to have veggies since all the other dishes are so rich for mains we had the duck tacos which was messy to eat but yummy and filling the hot skillet prawns are a must the lamb shoulder dish was rich and yummy but filling and definitely for sharing we got hot tea which actually worked so well with our meal because it helped cut the rich flavors between dishes i definitely recommend this place and would go again and maybe try their weekend brunch do not forget to make reservations,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,really really good mediterranean inspired food at this cozy and rustic restaurant the main entrance is directly opposite fortune center the yellow and white building along middle road and you have to walk in to a courtyard before you can see reservation counter of the restaurant the courtyard is beautiful with a lot of plants and a couple of tables if you fancy an al fresco dining experience and enough blood to donate to the mosquito community if you are coming from the side door it is just next to torte caf the brownie is to die for at the end of waterloo street i have dined at artichoke a couple of times both on weekend brunch and dinner and always had the best time here for brunch you need to come for their mezza platter perfect for  which consist of  mezze usually babaganoush hummus beetroot and smoked salmon and a few slices of toasted bread i suspect they rub the toasted bread with garlic hence making it really delicious and addictive one portion is never enough all the time for dinner last night we had the usual mezze plates of hummus babaganoush and beetroot while getting a roasted lemon chicken burrata and deep fried cauliflower to share all the mains were delicious and i wished we ordered second or third of the burrata i can eat burrata everyday the deep fried cauliflower was amazing too the best i have tried in singapore after pony dining in eagle strret pier brisbane flavors were spot on accompanied by chick peas and pomegranate for that extra texture heaven the grilled lemon chicken is moist and tender what makes it so special is the garlic puree no kissing after eating this so you have been forewarned that elevates the flavor of the chicken with a squeeze of lemon juice on it do check out the blackboard for weekly specials if you are into trying something new i have heard people complaint about the price being not wallet friendly here well i think it all depends on what you order and how you order they have their best seller the lambgasm a  kg bone in lamb shoulder slow roasted with assorted condiments selling at  so of course if you order this coupled with a few mains plus cocktails the bill will definitely come up to   the four of us ordered  mezze plates  mains with no drinks and we paid a total of   each last night considering the food we ate the price was relatively cheap and reasonable and we walked out from the restaurant feeling just nice not extremely full or bloated and very satisfied with dinner it can get very pack during weekend brunch and dinner so call in and make reservation to avoid any disappointment,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,beautiful beautiful food beautiful presentation beautiful ambiance this take on middle eastern joint is a wonderful vegetable forward place to take all the visiting yuppies in your life they replaced my cauliflower sabbich with brussel sprouts which i did not mind in the least bit it comes with this delightfully soft cooked egg that has an oozing yolk when you pierce it my cousin visiting from ny got the lamb shakshouka and his gf got the salmon pancake all of it looked and tasted amazing one star off because we dined outside where the only relief from the heat was a fan and some shade by the end of the meal the three of us americans had wilted oh and p s it was a  minute wait at pm on sunday,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,visited at pm on a sunday reservations recommended saw a long line for tables on the way in food was great a nice change from the typical cafe fare my only gripe was the cold service we tried cauliflower sabbich  i personally enjoyed this though would have preferred the pita to have been toasted grilled and the cauliflower crunchier to provide better texture this had a slightly soggy feel to it the israeli salad provided some tang which i liked and the smoked egg had a glorious flowy yolk would have preferred the egg warm rather than cold though overall a tasty dish haloumi mushrooms  the best dish of the  in my opinion the toast was thick and fluffy with generous portions of haloumi and mushrooms the best part was the smashed avocado spread on the toast it was salted nicely and went beautifully when you get a piece of toast with avocado haloumi and mushroom all in one bite artichoke fried chicken   pieces of chicken on a bed of crumbled hashed browns which went nicely with the garlic whip slightly too greasy for me and the chicken had a hint of honey did not enjoy the coleslaw but the chicken was flavorful we did not finish this good quality and novel food would return to try their intriguing dinner menu,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,had fantastic late dinner snacks here last night best babaganoush i have ever had in my life cozy casual setting and nice staff,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,easily one of the best middle eastern mediterranean restaurants on the red dot i would describe the decor as rustic chic if that makes any sense complemented by a full array of old school pop songs to set the vibe in layman is terms a cool place to eat and hangout in a communal setting the food itself is just tremendous my wife and i started off with the pita and hummus it was spot on next up was the slow roasted lamb shoulder wow simply wow the meat just fell off the bone after the first cut which is a testament to how tender it was mixed in with some amazing spices and herbs this dish easily was the star of the meal the other main dish we ordered was the charcoal grilled pork belly dish it was very good but surprisingly sweet i probably would not order both the lamb shoulder and the pork belly dish together as the flavours seemed to clash nevertheless these dishes on their own are just fantastic we topped the dinner off with artichoke is neh neh pops i went for the mango sticky pudding rice given my penchant for anything mango after the first bite it was no surprise to me that this was the best seller common how can you beat coconut rice mixed with blocks of frozen mango great food great vibe great company will definitely be back to try the other dishes but of course order that lamb shoulder again,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,loved this place we were able to make a reservation right before leaving the house we walked and found this restaurant tucked away with cobblestone like area leading up to it is entrance you are immediately greeted by the dessert case and then are seated in either patio or inside space the ambiance is overall chic hip the lighting in the evening is soft and romantic the food is phenomenal and the service is very good as well this is one of my favorite tapas joints in singapore we started with the red sangria pitcher and then ordered the roasted cauliflower which had pomegranate it was so tasty and different we also got the whole market fish  roasted pumpkin and humus they brought out pita but we were good paleo kids and did not touch it we saved our cheat for the dark chocolate and almond baklava delicious we will definitely be back,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,one of very few places i will truly miss when i leave singapore i have only been to artichoke for brunch so review does not cover dinner walk ins can be quite a wait but i have been lucky twice so far and was seated right away the cauliflower sabbich is to die for it is really perfect for singapore is hot weather as it has rich flavors and yet refreshing and if you are like me always on the lookout for fried roasted cauliflower it is absolutely amazing the artichoke fried chicken is spot on delicious crispy and juicy and the lamb shakshouka is super tender if you are a fan great coffee too planning to go back to try everything on their brunch menu,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,what can i fault with this place absolutely nothing great food great ambience and great service the only thing i can pick on would be their coffee as it tasted a little sour perhaps not the kind of coffee bean we like i wish we could have done the lambgasm but will probably end up full with just one dish,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,decent brunch but on the pricey side i have heard great things about the maple bacon chop but it was not as mindblowing as i thought it would be it was decent if a little greasy but not amazing lamb and fried chicken are decent unfortunately they do not split cards which means there are better places to go to for brunch with friends,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,we showed up at   and were turned away by unfriendly staff if the kitchen is going to close at   you should change the hours,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,reminds me of home my partner told me about the shop service was informed tasty dishes good on the wallet,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,excellent ambience just what i was in the mood for this evening open air small and well thought out menu and most definitely not in a mall the food was excellent the highlights of the evening being the pumpkin mezze and the babycorn mezze the feta buratta was light and perfectly fluffy the lamb was well cooked but a tad bit bitter imho but complimented by the burrata skipped dessert but will defiently return p s there were mice running around understandable in a tropical outdoor setting but nevertheless unnerving,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,we made reservations for brunch and were seated quickly though the place had several empty tables at the time our food came out quickly and everything was delicious lots of happy food noises were made i got the bacon and crab toast my spouse got the cauliflower sabbich the down side was service it was difficult to catch our waiter is eye he failed to bring out coffee in a timely manner so we cancelled it because we were almost done with our meal when we are back in singapore we will visit again,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,everyone around me knows my stinginess for giving  stars but not only do i give this jewel a  star but also would go as far as saying if i were to recommend just one restaurant to have a unique tantalizing food experience in singapore other than the local options like chicken rice chili crab that everyone must check off their list it would have be artichoke but with that being said i have heard the same thing being said about burnt ends which i will definitely try soon enough artichoke offers creative dishes while staying true to the root of its cuisine yes regardless of how delicious their food is some restaurants just puzzle me with what cuisine they are serving to me how delicately they pull this off amazing here goes the breakdown hummus    no frill good hummus not the watered down version that makes you question how much of chickpeas is in it a bit of a bummer that it does not come with any pita bread i know i can just eat spoonful s of hummus by itself but come one not even one pita bread    served hot pita bread served here is on the thicker side not too chewy but i can tell it is good quality actually understand why this is a separate item to be ordered rather than served on the side although i complained above on not coming with my hummus order this is a must order as many of the dishes at artichoke has sauces that deserves to be wiped to the bottom with this pita bread fresh fig goat cheese   i admit that even from just reading this menu i knew that i was to fall in love fig goat cheese simply cannot go wrong but then again how artichoke artfully put together fresh fig on a spread of creamy goat cheese was just orgasmic feta burrata   really fresh unique twist to the regular burrata dishes i would say this is the prime example of what i meant by creative while staying true to the root some may argue that burrata is italian but adding the feta kick to it absolutely justified its presence on the mediterranean menu innovative just plain delicious hot skillet prawn   jesus my friend and i almost licked the skillet  huge prawns that was better than lobster sauce was not to be wasted i remember this dish being rather salty last time but this time they were perfect have this just have it slow roasted lamb shoulder   so succulent full of flavor another dish that requires pita bread to wash the plate lamb was so well roasted the texture of the meat was soft while not mushy the smell of the lamb was very well controlled i know for some people the strong smell particular to lamb meat is of problem babaganoush    do not get me wrong just because i raved about other dishes so much does not mean that babaganoush was bad it was just different from my expectation of creamy dark colored paste artichoke is babaganoush made it very obvious that it was made of eggplant the texture and taste is maintained unlike other babaganoush i have tried it was good but i prefer my creamy dark colored version neh neh pops it shows that you do not have to go crazy complicated to come up with a strongly branded item neh neh pop is simple yet alluring presentation along with its hand packed looking packaging crafts a sense of craft no pun intended which draws people making them ignore the little voice in their head saying it is just magnum with bunch of stuffs put all over they seem to be actively experimenting with the flavors such as neh espresso cheesecake etc looking forward to all the fun flavors baklava flavor   i am a huge fan of balkava how its crispness is preserved while keeping all the mouth watering sweetness in between its layers but really not impressed by this flavor on nehneh pops ice cream was not rich either actually tasted a bit of icy ness which is what i taste when ice cream melts then re freezes i would not go for it a bit too sweet as baklava is sugary sweetness and ice cream chocolate is deeper sweetness strikes your tastebuds separately creating a not so pleasant overdose of sweetness strawberry pokey   contrary to my initial standing that it would be rather boring its back to basic approach was done very well i do not think the cover was white chocolate which really works for me i look for a lot of things when visiting a restaurant but here food speaks for the brand the ambiance entirety of experience is not bad but not impression leaving food is just so well done it is not only delicious un pretentious but also fun this is combination of using good ingredients adding succulent flavors playing with mix of tastes while not losing touch in presentation,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,expensive but worth every single dollar spent there is an instant vibe as soon as you walk in the atmosphere was upbeat modern and i almost felt back home in california each bite from every dish i tried made my eyes roll back in my head as i uttered an unconscious mmmmmmmm if you are going to eat here forget about the price and enjoy the food if you are on a tight budget go somewhere else,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,every time i am in singapore i make sure to come to artichoke i have been maybe  or  times over the past few years after having eaten all over the world artichoke stands out as being unique and almost extreme and yet is always masterfully balanced and oddly familiar you could eat here everyday it is consistently some of the best food i have ever eaten no it is not a gourmet michelin star restaurant but it is not meant to be just like the evolution of singaporean dishes that have been influenced by malay chinese and indian food bjorn shen does his voodoo using middle eastern cuisine as the foundation instead what he calls funky middle eastern omg it is magic the eclectic mix of hip hop reggae and rap music ensure the atmosphere is not stuffy and the staff who have been constant over the years are friendly and definitely know there stuff i rarely write reviews because i am too lazy or apathetic about my experience so do not take my review lightly and know that i am super serious when i say i wish more chefs were as wildly creative and open minded it would lead to some seriously awesome food and i need more of that in my life what i have tried muhammara more please cauliflower sabbich awesome flavors artichoke fried chicken chicken was super tender always amazed by restaurants that can cook chicken just enough so it does not taste undercooked but not dry it out especially with the thicker cuts yum lamb shakshouka what could be better for breakfast than lamb salmon pancake one of my favorites sadly not on the menu anymore hot skillet prawns i could eat it every day no really i want some right now maple glazed bacon chop be warned its big meaty and delicious,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,poorly managed place we came at pm for a quick brunch and they had plenty of empty tables   but refused to give one because they were reserved for pm we told them we would be gone by pm as we wanted a quick breakfast but apparently they cannot make breakfast in an hour it is better to keep the tables empty,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,the good nice al fresco seating option well aired so it doesnt get too hot even in the singapore heat central location overall great ambience their maple glazed thick cut bacon is really just one inch slab of pork belly i like my crispy thin bacon too but i cant complain with this good selection of not so typical brunch options if you are feeling more adventurous but they also have eggs dishes for the traditional brunch to balance it out the bad my scrambled eggs was too salty for me eggs should not be that salty,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,food awesome ambience awesome location cool prices pretty darn high what did you expect hahaha pretty awesome place and i really wish that i could afford to return every week great for all occasions and usually packed from what i remember i simply love the fact that they do not do the typical japanese fusion but rather chose middle eastern fusion instead it is rare it is delicious and under appreciated artichoke is a place for a real food lover their fried chicken is pretty sick too,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,some of my friends said i should try this place so here i am after work and starving i can sit outside and enjoy my freshly ordered watermelon weizen it is in the cider section of the menu if you want to give it a try too as a starter some pita with hummus the pita bread is still warm when i start dipping it into the hummus the hummus is good but could take a little more garlic for my taste main dish mutton as the waiter suggested very delicious and tender really loved the seasoning and taste no way to finish the dish though better next time bring some people to share before i left i had a look inside nice modern arrangement with little funny bits here and there one can even order beer for the chefs not sure if you want to do that though to summarize i will definitely come back and try something else but better not alone so i have some help finishing my order,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,a little something special artichoke is very special in my opinion in terms of everything from the food to the location and atmosphere thanks to my beautiful friend who arrived first i did not have to queue to get a table for a saturday brunch the entrance to this restaurant is a short alley amongst empty houses it almost became a quaint place hidden in the middle of busy streets we were seated outdoor in a lovely garden menu was quite interesting it is probably because i am not experienced with middle eastern food we had  dishes to share and my apology for not having the exact name but they are  a big pile of burrata on top of buttery bread i am biased from having osteria mozza the night before so this can not match up but i would say it is not too bad  salmon pancake which i thought was quite delicious a good combination of sweetness from the pancakes and saltiness from the smoked salmon artichoke seemed to be very generous with its portion and the two of us were so stuffed after those  dishes we had a look at the overdough bakery and everything looked so delicious i will definitely come back to try some baked goods,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,personally i think their menu is not like the basic brunch menu they offers a quite healthy and unique brunch menu that others cafe mightnot have must try,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,there are always some restaurants that make you wanna keep going back every month and this place has been a staple for me since i first discovered it the bestseller on the menu lambgasm has never disappointed other must have on my order list are the seasoned cauliflower and assorted finger licking good hummus thumbs up on the pomegranates hummus the seasonal beef special reminds me of the specialty back in my hometown taiwan the famous beef noodles will definitely recommend the resto to anyone who is into al fresco dining they have indoor space as well good for a friday night out or sunday brunch advance reservations recommended for peak hours splitting to two bills maximum,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,since we moved to singapore less than two months ago we have eaten here three times already once for brunch twice for dinner the dcor of this place is quite rustic and it reminds me of some of the places we used to frequent in new york city where the chef cares very much about the food and nothing else as for our first experience we came late for brunch to avoid the crowd unfortunately half of the dishes on the brunch menu were sold out by the time we got seated around pm although i was dying for some fried chicken the second best thing available on the menu mushroom scrabbled egg was just equally delicious they do accept ressy for brunch so make sure you call to get a table personally i enjoyed our dinner even more so than brunch the menu is bigger about  mezzes and  entrees plus some side dishes the must haves pumpkin and eggplant from the mezze burrata and prawns from the entre it is not a late night place as their last kitchen call comes before,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,taste is excellent price is outrageous i know small plates are fashionable but some of their starters were micro sized staff clearly has no clue about service or the food manager walks about really doing nothing this restaurant has so much potencial if they could only get the basics right besides being overly pretentious,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,it is a real chic cafe bar dining place creative menus that are fresh but balanced in taste especially enjoyed cauliflower sabbich fried chicken was quite good too,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,one of those places that we go to again and again due to good food nice atmosphere and great service the food is tapas style middle eastern ish note that the food is not authentic as is intended at brunch we have enjoyed the califlower sandwich eggs and a big slab of well prepared pork belly which is huge and very well prepared and smoked salmon at dinner we have enjoyed the traditional mezzes hummus halloumi cheese baba ganoush sardines etc and lamb shank the food is quite filling so try not to over order the wine prices for value are also good for the money for singapore being the caveat i note that the chef is good with textures meaning that most dishes have a crunch or a texture even if traditionally smooth dishes the only thing that i would not recommend are the deserts other than the traditional plain baklava we have had a few and they are mostly a hot mess with too many components jellies crumbles etc that do not just go together i view the deserts as theweak point great restaurant and ranks in our top  of most visited due to all of the above,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,okay at best maybe even not that this is one of those places that makes me think its reviews are all fake all of the raves of this place must be fake or by people who have no idea what food should taste like the food here is not all that its really not the reality is that this place has bland food that looks and sounds good first we ordered the hummus they say they make it on site i call bs on that if they are making it they are doing it wrong it tastes and looks store bought well not even that good all they do is put sprinkle some paprika and smoked salt on top of cheap hummus with cheap oil thats it its bland tasteless and just boring next we had the fried cauliflower again boring and nothing special it looks great but has no flavor after that the fried chicken and beef ribs they both sounded great on the menu with all the fancy spices but none of the flavors came through with the chicken all you can taste is the old cheap oil they use to fry it the breading and some sugar they use in the funky garlic sauce the ribs were just sweet and tender none of the flavors came out it was just soggy tender overly sweet meat finally we had the famous sticky date pudding this was just taking the piss its just watered down peanut butter with grass jelly topped with ground up chinese peanut cakes and sugar no dates nothing sticky and no flavor other than sugar and cheap peanut cakes a great example of up selling they use really cheap ingredients make it look fancy and sell it for a ton of money this last dish made me feel like i was a rube getting fleeced i bet their food costs are  i wish the food in singapore was as good as the food in seoul or tokyo but its just not restaurants like these confirm my opinion the only good food in singapore is at hawker centers if you go to places like this its just for atmosphere and not for good food its a total waste of money,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,heard many many great things about artichoke and finally visited last weekend for a friend is farewell brunch had to try before leaving not sure if we were too last minute as we were told no reservations taken and to try walking in at  pm on sunday so for a change we arrived  pm sharp and was told it is a  minute wait place did look busy with most of the outdoor seats table and on a sunday noon in may it was hot and steamy just as the tropics should be we decided to retreat to the fortune center across the street for a cup of coffee  mins easily killed and by the time we returned we were promptly shown to our table thank god we were seated indoors with ac i mean the outdoor area looks charming but not at  pm in the afternoon dinner should be fine though i was quite surprised by how big the space is inside i have passed by several times when i visited objectifs next door and the restaurant space always looks a bit crammed so i assume it was mostly outdoors we were seated in an indoor patio area which has been converted into part of the indoor dining space with natural lighting seeping through the glass ceiling perfect setting for sunday brunch i was delighted to find out that it is a middle eastern themed menu definitely a welcoming change from the typical steak eggs benedict aplenty across the island it also reminds me of one of my favorite restaurants ottolenghi in london the first thing that caught my eye on the brunch menu was the cauliflower sabbich essentially a pita bread open sandwich topped with grilled deep fried cauliflower hummus labneh and served with a smoked egg that resembles funnily enough a chinese tea leaves smoked egg it is flavorful without being over seasoned healthy but filling we also had the lamb shashouka which is basically your normal shashouka with shreds of lamb in it again wo not be complete without scooping chunks of it up with pieces of pita bread the lemonade was a bit too sweet but otherwise a refreshing cooler in the heat of the singapore afternoon cannot wait to check out their dinner options and if you are visiting the afternoon do drop by at the objectifs next door they always have interesting exhibitions and will be a good place to stroll around and burn off some of that food,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,first off this place does not feel like singapore i absolutely love that it is in a small hidden area and both a colonial yet modern vibe food toast jam and butter the bread was good almost like a popover but the jam and fois butter were a little bit of a let down also the butter came out with sprinkles on it which was an unnecessary addition in my opinion artichoke chicken so crispy a little bit on the sweet side but some of the best chicken i have had in singapore also really enjoyed the slaw and pickles lamb shashouka flavorful and hearty meat was tender and seasoned wellmaple bacon chop tasted more like a ham than bacon wish there was more of a crispy element to it but it was a good serving size had a great brunch here and i am eager to go back and try their dinner menu,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,found this place with the help of yelp and am very glad i did it is in a very nice location on waterloo road not far from the mrt you walk in off the street and right away you get the sense that this place is a little bit different an outdoor patio covered thank goodness as well as seating indoors i was there just before opening but the staff were very pleasant giving me a menu to look at while they busied themselves getting ready once inside and seated at the bar i was by myself so that seemed the best option also i did not have a reservation and they were clearly going to be busy that night i met the manager ronnie and was immediately charmed the beer was frosty and cold  c according to the fridge and the music was excellent very edgy but not off putting or too loud i ordered the chef is menu and was blown away everything was excellent from the starters to the main courses to the dessert presentation was artful but not fussy loved the range of flavours the wood smoked beef was a particular hit they have a wood fire oven in the kitchen it is definitely on my list of places to return to,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,it is welcome and pls book  days in advance if you want to sit inside,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,the good atmosphere and staff reign supreme here in a very close second is the food i lucked out by ordering the sampler brunch plate and was rewarded with a middle eastern smrgsbord of tasty treats everyone else at the table had their forks on my plate which come to think of it was rude the bad as with any popular place especially for brunch the spot gets bustling so reservations are not only recommended but pretty much a necessity oh brunch reservations you are such a double edged sword as it is almost impossible to get people to commit to an early morning anything during the weekends but without you i am left waiting in line slowly but surely people here are getting used to the bliss that is brunch so i have to take the good with the bad the ugly i do not really care for middle eastern cuisine i just do not and i have physically been over there to eat it artichoke however i care for very much everything was hitting it is stride from the playlist to the patrons from the hospitality to the hummus from the coffee to the yeah you get the picture on our way out the host gave us a going away goodie bag filled with a few gummy candies take away the fact that i love gummy candy more than any other candy on earth it was still a nice gesture will return for dinner open mind in hand,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,great place for a brunch in sg according to the time we had to queue on a saturday morning i am surely not the only one thinking that as it is written on the wall it ai not no american brunch do not look for pancakes they mainly serve eggs but offer a various range of dishes they all look good sit on the counter and you will have the opportunity to chitchat with the owner he knows about european soccer and can name a few players at least a few belgian players nice area to visit afterward,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,i love artichoke really i do i would love it more if it was not so taxing on my wallet though i get the idea of sharing platters though i do not really like to share plus my friends are greedy we usually pop in at very strange hours like pm and zoom in to the dessert menu so far we have had all three desserts cookie pie sticky date pudding and that milk pudding with rose and strawberry thing that tastes just like bandung my favorite so far has got to be the sticky date coffee wise the iced mocha is waaaaay too sweet and why are they charging cents more just for it to be iced like i said do not get me wrong i really enjoy my artichoke visits and i love the snarky website and how the chairs are so thoughtfully placed three white one black three white one black then three black one white and the little baggies of sour gums on the way out it is a fun albeit expensive place to hang out at,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,recommend for brunch do not recommend for dinner so a ok in my book brunch lamb shakshouka was amazing not at all a healthy choice but very very good and it would not be a stretch to say all my friends had serious food envy as soon as the dish arrived mezza platter looked good your standard mezza platter scrambled eggs looked pretty good as well but with all the bacon pork belly on the side the plate was very very greasy oily and it was rather off putting for me though i am sure for some the generous portion of bacon would be a plus our appetizers of haloumi and hummus did not come until after all of our entrees but aside from the poor timing they were enjoyable friend had the banana muffin from the dessert window and thoroughly enjoyed it when we arrived without a reservation at am on sunday i was told it would be a  hour wait and that reservations are usually full for brunch by the wednesday before the weekend luckily we were seated after waiting only about  minutes but i would recommend making a rez if you can plan that far in advance dinner after a delicious brunch at artichoke my friends and i were excited to come back for dinner and to try the desserts unfortunately we were rather underwhelmed by the dinner options the dinner menu consisted of a number of dished which i would refer to as dips or sides but not actual dinners granted there are a couple full dinner options maybe  mostly hearty sounding meat dishes but there was a serious lack of selection in my opinion what about my vegetarian friends hummus for dinner there was not even a salad on the menu my friend and i ordered hummus the red pepper dip and the grilled cauliflower the latter it appears was forgotten about as it never came the two dips a few drinks and dessert were enough to fill us up hummus was good we ordered it again after enjoying it at brunch red pepper dip was weird it was topped with pomegranate seeds which were not listed on the menu as part of the dish and they were really overpowering made the dip too sweet in my opinion i had sticky date pudding for dessert not what i was expecting the pudding was topped with what i can only describe as date flavored jello i scraped these off and focused on the cake y part of the dish and the vanilla sauce this was good but the jello like topping was weird and i did not enjoy it we arrived around   on friday evening and were told despite the more than half empty status of the restaurant that they were fully booked luckily the nice folks at artichoke were willing to serve my friend and i drinks at one of the side tables meant to be just for waiting but not technically part of the restaurant and then they were able to give us a table for dinner after about   minutes note not sure about the reservation system as when i walked in the wait times i was quoted ended up being rather exaggerated if you can make a reservation i would suggest it but if you forgot i would say try your luck walking in dips do not come with bread you have to pay extra to have something to dip in your hummus etc service is slow but always very nice and friendly you get a tiny packet of gummy candies as a goodbye when you leave so sweet and yum,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,i love artichoke i lived in the middle east for a little bit and i have always found all the middle eastern cuisine in singapore to be really godawful nobody was trying to emphasize the freshness of the ingredients and unique dishes from that part of the world chef bjorn shen has a magical touch his interpretation of moorish food is spot on artichoke does all that and more in its beautiful restaurant in the lovely sculpture square building it is such a happy place to be in it is now my favourite place to go to for brunch the scrambled eggs are amazing here so is the lamb shakshouka i have heard a lot about the dinner and cannot wait to come back again to try the pork belly,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,had brunch here a week ago with a couple of girl friends and for my first impression i would say that it is decent the food on offer while not really my favourites are an interesting take on the standard brunch dishes we ordered something different so that we could try and i must say we are pleased that what we ordered gave us a good taste of what artichoke can offer service is decent and prices are pretty affordable too definitely a spot to go to if you are sick of standard brunches,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,artichoke was a fantastic experience for me i loved it is convenient location in the city and near the bras basah mrt yet it is somehow quietly tucked away in a corner complete with a lovely cobblestoned courtyard bamboo plants and dim lighting the service there is excellent the staff are attentive and a chatty manager checked in on my table to see if you are enjoying the food he was also helpful in recommending dishes and wines or drinks that go with the food this is one of the best restaurants in singapore for moorish food the dinners here are more social as we all ordered dishes to share rather than a main each expect very different flavours from what you are used to the lamb here is incredibly tender and does not have a strong gamey smell or taste even people who do not usually eat lamb found it very good here my favourite exotic dish was the forgotten grain salad finally something healthy that is not all green and tastes great the slow roasted pork belly had incredibly crispy crackling and the meat melted in my mouth we also ordered the organic mushrooms that had been grown on a local farm artichoke currently has a project to grow their own herbs and vegetables which i think is just incredible the desserts there are made by them as well and i have to say they really take the cake the salted caramel sticky date pudding was my absolute favourite it came in a generous portion as well we also had the basil cheescake with fresh watermelon balls and the flavours were divine i could not believe how great the combination was we really enjoyed all the amazing dishes and i am looking forward to trying their brunch menu soon their menu does change fairly often so drop in and try those delectable dishes before they are off the menu,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,wife and i had dinner there last night first time walked in to try our luck w out reservation luckily waited less than  mins and were shown to a table outside ordered pita with hummus and taramasalata followed by skillet prawns for drinks wife had soursop juice and i had a glass of sauvignon blanc all food was up to our high expectations created by reading others reviews only niggle we had was that the skillet prawns were presented with too much oily cream delicious though it was we were tempted to smother bites of the large tiger prawns in it and paid the price soon after we felt full gelak in local speak such that we could not order more to eat for the prawn dish it is better to go in a group of  so each will only have  large prawn and then you can sample more of their other food offerings soursop juice was good and served in a generous glass wine was ok service was good and food served up speedily even with the crowd and the manager was especially helpful noisy ambience with loud music and although music choice was not exactly off putting sound quality was loud music played thru small cheap speakers system detracts from the atmosphere it was meant to create not to mention enjoyment of quality cooked food and it makes relaxed conversation difficult perhaps this might even be deliberate so that patrons do not linger and they get the tables turned over twice conclusion good enough to revisit before long especially to try other interesting menu items not least because pricing was fair for what you get will need another couple to come with us though,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,what better way to spend a public holiday in the middle of the week than a long brunch and what better way to recover from a hangover than sangria at am it was with this thought in mind that i made my way to artichoke cafe bar on a tuesday for some breakfast and good company with no reservation we were forced to sit outside although we were lucky that it was a relatively cool day in singapore tucked away in the courtyard behind two buildings we were suddenly transported away from present day singapore to colonial singapore the wicker chairs the red painted outer wall of the cafe the white paneled windows and doors the place had its charms no doubt but would it live up to its potential artichoke is brunch menu is relatively simple although i could see the ingredients were high quality and a lot of thought had been put into piecing together the items on the menu the quality menu was lost on its servers though who were clueless as to what the menu contained what the ingredients were and what they themselves were doing there needless to say service was slow and confusing but it was hard to be mad at the servers who were so utterly clueless it would be like scolding newborns i started off with a sangria to put me in the mood for a slow day instead i was jolted awake by how absolutely awful the sangria tasted it seemed like their idea of sangria was citrus soda with white wine a place like this could not afford to cut up some real fruits for a sangria sangria is such a straight forward drink how could they screw that up i was not feeling the love what they gave me was barely drinkable so i let it sit and watched the condensation slide down the glass as we waited for our food i opted for the scrambled eggs and bacon chop which turned out to be a good decision the maple glazed bacon chop was thick and meaty with just enough fat to be tender and fragrant the scrambled eggs were on the runny side purposefully so i also tried my friend is hash browns which were crisp and delicious and oily as hash browns go originally i asked for ketchup to go with the eggs and hash browns but they said the kitchen did not have any a brunch place that does not have any ketchup just as i was working myself into a huff i asked if they had maple syrup and lo and behold they did the tension was quickly diffused as i embraced my canadianism and poured a generous portion of maple syrup over everything on my plate while the food turned out to be good the service was in a constant state of hopeless confusion and the sangria was an unmistakable failure i would probably not return unless a friend of mine decided to host a meal here and even then it would only be for the ambiance,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,been here a few times always had great food and service the lamb is fantastic highly recommend this place,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,i know i should have written one right from the start when yelp became an sg phenomenon i held back because i know the menu i had relished is not quite the same and reviewing it before i went back for its main stays right now would be a waste of time to read well since i have been teased aptly on this day for being the first rotd due to technical glitches previously that rigged this honour for me here is my review of artichoke that comes highly recommended i am a middle eastern somewhere in my gut belly and artichoke has always satisfied and put me into a medi mood for weeks after i dine there they did it again with their awesome mezzes on the menu for just  dish  dishes i have my turkish haunts when i have that itch for endless eggplants but talking about true comfort meeting epicurean try this middle eatery modern eastern establishment great food prep principles and ethical food business and practices i very proudly would pay to dine simply they deserve it so back to mezzes i personally am head over heels over the babaganoush and the tarama bjorn owner chef nailed the eggplant is savouriness with the smoky tender silky mouthfeel all in the babaganoush the tarama ish dip is not some caviar but its pale creaminess that gives that slight fishy or as i would like to perceive as the goodness of the sea is from smoked oyster honestly balancing all those big flavours with the right mouthfeel nailed it i shamelessly used my finger and wiped the plate as i was speaking to some people i have just met for the first time of my life soooooooooo i guess artichoke won,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,artichoke cafe is one of my favorite restaurants in singapore because of its consistently good food the food here is fresh and full of garlicky olive oil goodness when we asked the waiter about the type of cuisine here he stated that it consists of syrian lebanese greek influences basically it is a mediterranean medley and it is common for your table to share a few dishes appetizers the mezzo fresh hummus red pepper dip pickled octopus anchovies are all fresh and very tasty here entrees i have only eaten here for dinner and have also taken part in lambgasm a   kg feast of lamb with sides while the lamb and beef are cooked well i really like the vegetarian options here as well the cauliflower and broccoli dishes are both caramelized to perfection and topped with some type of garlic anchovy sauce it is salty tangy and completely delicious dessert mmm sticky date pudding i have not had any of the underdoughs desserts but the baklava and tarts at least look great the inability to split bills is a little odd as was a call to alter a reservation once it took  minutes for the waitress to understand i had an existing reservation and just wanted to move the time but the small packet of gummy worms at the end of every meal put me in a better mood,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,had dinner here one thursday and was surprised at how quiet it was given it is a firm favourite of one of our foodie friends however the food was good i would not go so far as great with plenty of choices and attentive service a cafe cum restaurant with a tapas mediterranean meze fusion style menu i think artichoke is having a bit of an identity crisis as i am not sure what sort of brand it is going for if it is going for one at all i would suggest coming here with a group of friends we ordered everything from salads to breads to meats to poultry to dessert i especially the flat breads and the quinoa rice salad the mushies were also delish apparently the menu changes regularly and the owner chef travels abroad once a year to get inspiration as well as contribute to the local community of wherever they are visiting along with   drinks each we spent approx  pp i do not remember any music playing while we were there so i would recommend some background sounds to add some ambience the small paper bag of candy given to us on the way out was a nice treat i would be interested to see how brunch is there is alfresco dining in the courtyard which is appealing but in the meantime a good spot for evening imbibing with friends,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,love artichoke cafe we first stumbled upon artichoke after seeking out the best breakfast in singapore we were blown away the menu is fresh eclectic and most importantly delicious we then decided to bring a group of friends along to try out their dinner menu there were  of us which allowed us to sample a large portion of their menu literally everything was incredible we returned a few weeks later and were initially disappointed to see that some of our favorite dishes were no longer on the menu our fears were quickly relieved as each of the new entrees were also incredible i have celiac disease and cannot eat gluten the manager has come to the table each time we have dined with them and pointed out all of the dishes that would be suitable for me as well as which entrees can be modified for my consumption this type of service is hard to come by in singapore the atmosphere is casual with a mix of table and chair styles and a large chalk board directing you to the restroom this is one of my absolute favorite restaurants in singapore they essentially require you to have a reservation before dining with them so definitely call ahead to reserve your space,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,this is one of the few places in singapore that serve a great coffee food is mediterranean style we ordered a platter of anti pasto to share taste was ok the setting and atmosphere is perfect for a brunch with friends or a casual date,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,loved the food at artichoke there was a harmonious mesh of flavours and a refined symmetry in everything for sure artichoke is going down as one of  is bests eats psa for first timers to artichoke it is at the junction of waterloo street and middle road the little restaurant is tucked away in a nook behind this bright yellow heritage chalet looking building opposite fortune centre and next to the singapore council of women is organisations scwo along waterloo street park along waterloo street or fortune centre we had  slow roasted lamb shoulder  sumptuous and hearty and rich but balanced with meat so soft it practically fell off the bone one of the very best lamb i have ever had in my life  smoked chicken  succulent and perfumed with a heady char greenland halibut fish fingers  loved the pairing with velvety squid ink tartare sauce duck adana kebab tacos  per pair may not have received the same amount of love as the preceding dishes but i liked it well enough it was texturally meaty and its intense potency was countered by crisp apple strips shaved radish a drizzling of lively garlic chive oil and creamy avocado hummus  charred broccoli  strewn with a piquant hodgepodge of miso vinaigrette crumbed feta pickled garlic pickled shimeiji and mint so good we ordered seconds,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,unfortunately very disappointing for me although others in my group enjoyed it in summary no fried cauliflower with pomegranate no lemon chicken no fried chicken no dark chocolate and almond baklava instead consistently salty meat dishes and few healthy vegetables expensive i wo not be back,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,my favourite brunch place we moved to singapore only a few months ago we are so happy to find this place around our home must try cauliflower sabbich fried chicken,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,artichoke was probably my fave new restaurant of this trip to singapore very creative ambience old church set in the energetic and colorful bugis area delicious food and very attentive service from both the owner and the friendly and attentive servers i cannot say enough about the service since my experience in other restaurants was absolutely disappointing the owner was so on top of things spotted my parents with us and knew exactly how to approach the challenge made awesome recommendations and came back over and over again to check on us the waitstaff was smart and friendly very well trained servers the food was delicious from the meze platter to the lamb shiska sp and my sis is haloumi cheese salad the date pudding was delicious too prices are very reasonable brunch is only served on the weekends we will be back to check out dinner service be sure to make reservationshighly highly recommend,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,slow disorganized but most of all every single thing ordered was just dripping in grease i could not even eat it gross,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,love love this place this reminds me of the courtyards of milan the menu selection is limited but there is a good reason for that the dishes are carefully crafted and superbly delicious cant wait to be back,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,consistently good both dinner and brunch on weekends sitting outside courtyard is better than inside recommendation brunch beetroot and salmon with pomegranate seeds dinner octopus with sizzling egg,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,since i missed out on the last yelp elite event held at overdough jac s suggested that the gals head out to artichoke for our dinner with the gals so that we can try the awesome desserts from overdough and also savour the mediterranean dishes available at artichoke i have to say that the food here is not too bad though it is slightly on the pricey side the portion was huge and we actually shared  main dishes among  girlies we ordered the duck and the chicken though the duck was more moist in texture the flavour was not as great as the chicken the chicken would have also been more enjoyable if it wasnt as dry overall good taste but a slight mis match in terms of the texture the atmosphere of the restaurant is nice and generally a nice place to hang out may not be a top of mind place to head to but still worth going back again someday,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,very poor handling of customers i called the restaurant to make a reservation at  am the guy told me they were not taking reservations any more but they have tables available and we can walk in with the condition that we return the table by pm we reached in  mins and we are told that the waiting time for tables is minimum  mins,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,my order of scrambled eggs with rocket tomatoes za atar bread and thick cut maple glazed bacon chop  was delish the scrambled eggs at artichoke are one of the best i have had anywhere with a creamy smooth yet fluffy texture and seasoned to perfection they go immensely well with the roasted corn and cherry tomatoes and complemented the sweet yet savoury maple glazed bacon chop which is a popular order given that unlike normal paper thin bacon the one served at artichoke is about  cm thick and incredibly sinful good za atar bread however was overly hard and difficult to enjoy as good as the scrambled eggs were the lamb shakshouka  stole the show consisting of eggs in a skillet w tomato sauce roast lamb shoulder kashkaval cheese pistachio dukka za atar bread the mediterranean brunch item is a refreshing change from the usual eggs and bacon and i am utterly sold by the savoury mildly spicy dish of course the lamb was cooked till it breaks easily and the sauce was appetizing though the huge portion meant it was difficult to finish unless you have friends to help you along which i am sure they would gladly do like i did for pictures and the full review visit voraciousappetite wordpr,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,oh wow this was a cool little spot this was possibly the best place i ate at in singapore over a  week trip i got the slow cooked lamb with the date coffee bbq sauce and it was a pleasant experience to say the least everything was on point from the simple slaw to the pita good vibe and the owner seems to be a nice guy,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,this is one of the best places for brunch in fact it might be my top recommended place for it because of how unique it is instead of your usual indie cafe that sells poached eggs drenched in hollandaise sauce and some salads for  bucks artichoke has more of an egyptian or middle eastern influences to their cuisine it shows in their brunch sets too with the use of feta cheese and hummus etc my favorite is actually a very simple dish the scrambled eggs with rocket feta cheese and organic mushrooms those mushrooms if this is what organic tastes like i wo not mind having all my food be organic it is really delicious for the more carnivorous humans they also have the same combi expect with mushrooms replaced with a bacon chop when they say bacon chop do not think of thin strips but a slab of three layered pork very intimidating looking but also delicious and satisfying do remember to check the opening times for the place it fills up really fast so be sure to make an reservation at least  days in advance,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,was looking forward to eating here as i had a great experience a year ago turns out the host who seated us was very rude almost as if he was uninterested in our patronage he was not interested in looking for a table for us and we know how bad service can completely sour the taste of food maybe that is why when i started on my haloumi and mushrooms it tasted bland a mere shadow of what it used to be probably not coming back,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,great food i love the lamp steak it is one of the best in singapore island highly recommended,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,go for the brunch there was a long wait at the tables but we snagged the last two seats at the bar it is a little pricy but that may have just been my skewed impression after spending the last few days in thailand and malaysia the house made lemonade had a nice kick and freshness to it i wish i could have the lamb shakshouka again super tender lamb that fell apart easily surrounded by a rich tomato sauce if you want some savory brunch dishes no pancakes or french toast here this is the place to go,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,one of my fave brunch plc in singapore,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,so good wonderful setting great staff and an amazing mezze platter that makes sunday brunch a delight small menu focused on doing a few things really well which they do,Positive
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,while the food here is undeniably amazing everything we ordered other than the beets were out of this world good the prices are too high the portions are too small and the service is terrible our waiter waited a good  minutes after seating us to take our drink orders we finally ordered the lamb and chicken entrees as well as the broccoli brussel sprouts hummus egg plant and beets appetizers to share with three orders of pita bread they completed botched our order three of the dishes were wrong and when we asked for the correct dishes it took an additional  minutes to get the proper dishes delivered by that point everything was cold and the serving sizes were tiny definitely not enough to share so we ended up having to order more the staff was totally unapologetic about the incorrect order and had the audacity to ask us to hurry up eating after they were the reason it took so long because they wanted our table for later reservations regardless of how good the food is we will not be coming back and would not recommend it to anyone,Negative
artichoke-cafe-and-bar,visiting for the second time made me a little disappointed the food was not great it was not bad but not outstanding i still like their yard and the fact that you can hang out on a saturday morning outside,Negative
din-tai-fung,th time here busy busydim sum was on point no surprise there right hot and sour soup was the bomb,Negative
din-tai-fung,always nice to eat at one of my favorite restaurants that serve soup dumpling if you are craving good chinese food come here,Positive
din-tai-fung,i cannot recommend the truffle dumpling enough they are delicious and amazingly decadent i wish there were smaller portions for some items so singles can get some variety but everything i tasted was wonderful,Positive
din-tai-fung,outstanding food and even better service if you want one of the best meals in singapore go here you will not regret it side note extremely friendly and helpful with small children our daughter had a blast here,Positive
din-tai-fung,overrated if you order  or  orders of dumplings then you might be able to distinguish the taste but we ordered more than  orders all different ones so i felt that it all tasted the same after my nd dumpling the oriental salad was delicious and my favorite the fried rice was incredibly tasty too the duck wrap i ordered was good but i would not order it again i was not a fan of their bbq pork buns all dough and barely any meat filling service was subpar we were ignored for a short while i would pick the dim sum at the hawker centers instead,Negative
din-tai-fung,i finally got to try the din tai fung is famous steamed pork dumplings there is a location in the raffles city shopping center the verdict pretty tasty how do they make these how do they get the soup to stay inside the meat and the dumpling itself was delicious but i would not say it was mind blowing maybe i had high expectations because it was so hyped up i also tried the steamed chicken soup because the menu said it was another thing they were famous for i did not like this as much i thought the broth was kind of bland and most of the chicken was white meat so slightly dry they give you a pen and you have to mark down how many of each item you want for the dumplings you have the option of getting six pieces or ten pieces and it comes out in one of those bamboo steamer baskets overall tasty dumplings but nothing to go out of your way for,Negative
din-tai-fung,i have been here twice now i waited to write a review because i wanted to make sure my first trip was not an anomalyi do not understand why everyone is so crazy about this place one just opened near san francisco and the wait time can be three hours i figured i would try it in se asia the second time there i waited for a single table almost one hour the service is lousy a runner just dumps the dish on the table and leaves without checking if it is correct or you need anything else but the worst part was the xiao long bao both times was dried out like it had been sitting on a warming shelf for a while this is supposed to be the reason people come here my order was wrong one of the times but i was too annoyed at waiting an hour so i did not complain the sides were okay i will never come back,Negative
din-tai-fung,if you ever find yourself in singapore do your self a favor avoid the super snooty overpriced restaurants find this little gem which truthfully is not so little at all and come hungry they have an incredibly wide assortment of dim sum as week as their speciality soup dumplings nom nomyou will certainly not be disappointed though this location wo not win any rewards in ambience and decor it is clean decorum coupled with an efficiency in both acquiring a table and being served or food with  minutes of being seated is an award all to itself whilst waiting to be seated you are given both a menu on a clipboard and a picture book of all the succulent options some options come in multiples of    or  so make sure to carefully discern quantity when making your selections you are also assigned a queue number which is conveniently illuminated at the entrance just above your head thus no mystery as to when you will be seated once your number your number is called the hostess takes your menu reviews your order with you before seating at your table which is being cleaned quickly during that time once you are seated you receive the first of your items usually within  minutes efficiency ladies and gents is the name of the game when going to most places in singapore,Positive
din-tai-fung,came to dtf with friends for brunch this was my first time here and the friends said they offered more on the singapore menu than the one back at home we tried the pork and veggie dumplings yum shrimp and pork shumai yum fried pork and shrimp wontons yum pork rib soup yum soup dumplings yum stir fried bok choy yum shrimp and pork wontons in soup yum crab and pork dumplings good very crabby aaaaand crispy shrimp pancake bomb overall my first experience at dtf was so worth it,Positive
din-tai-fung,this was our first stop for food on the first morning of our most recent visit to singapore dumplings i love the consistency every restaurant churns out the same great food and hopefully decent service this place gives you a basket for your purse and a napkin to cover it that way no dumpling juice or soy splashes it we shared the pork and tofu noodles pork xlb shrimp and pork xlb duck skin cigars and red bean sticky rice all solid choices and i enjoyed everything we ate,Positive
din-tai-fung,wow i am not a chinese food expert but this was good stuff chicken soup was indescribably delicious and made my tummy feel good the steamed pork dumplings were amazing,Positive
din-tai-fung,the food is always consistent at any din tai fung i have been too i loooove the oriental salad and all the yummy dimsum,Positive
din-tai-fung,i would say this place is overrated stopped by for dinner last night and ordered the soup dumpling with a vermicelli soup the vermicelli soup with fried tofu was pretty good the broth was really flavorful but the soup dumpling is lacking in flavor big time true the skin is thin has the right consistency and there juice inside however the flavor of the filling is also a big part of the soup dumpling and i found the meat filling was rather bland,Negative
din-tai-fung,i realise i have falled into a predictable pattern of late whenever i want dim sum i go to dtf few restaurants have inspired such loyalty from me and that is simply owing to their reliable dim sum with consistent quality not to say there are not any cons the waiting time can range from   minutes on the weekends although they are kind enough to let you pick your food while you wait and make your order just as you are whisked to a table the menu is a bit limited in my opinion no char siew pau or chee cheong fun two staples on the dim sum menu it is also not particularly adventurous if you are into that sort of thing having said that whatever they do serve is very good promptly dished the pork and chilli crab steamed bun is delicious as is their soup dumplings i am also a sucker for their mango pudding which i never have space for because i have just gorged on  prawn and pork dumplings if you want some otherworldly dim sum you wo not get it here if you just want a straightforward good dumpling this place will not fail you,Positive
din-tai-fung,decent quality and consistent food i like the egg fried rice sometimes i get it with shrimp and the wonton soup good stuff can count on it being the same every time i go of course the xiao long baos are decent too,Positive
din-tai-fung,really good huge menu i tasted many of them good prices even for singapore free refill tea is great what can i say i loved it,Positive
din-tai-fung,yes i am a fan of this place i was a bit worried that it wo not be as good as the original place in taiwan but they are quite good when i worked near city hall i used to come here once a week and yes that is how satisfying it was try their red bean dessert dumplings,Positive
din-tai-fung,on a personal note this is the last restaurant review i will write from my recent time living in singapore i truly loved the island and took immense joy in exploring its varied culinary landscape it is special place populated by such amazing people locals and expats from the depth of my heart i hope i am able to return someday this is a review of dinner with two friends at din tai fung in raffles city shopping centre tinyurl com lvncbthis din tai fung is located in the basement level of raffles city it is pretty far into the level and can be a little difficult to locate also unless you arrive early for dinner you should expect a wait i think we arrived around   or so we had a  to  minute wait for our table but i think those arriving when we were being seated were probably having a little longer wait the ambiance is a notch above basic but still trends towards the functional i would not place it at the level of fine dining it lacks the attention to detail that a fine dining room displays tinyurl com kldxxdthe staff is very effective i would not necessarily use the word friendly though they are certainly not rude everyone just seems too busy and focused on their tasks to take a moment for overt politeness also the experience seems to be based on speed get folks seated get their order get them their food asap and get them on their way rinse and repeat the food ranged from good to extremely good tinyurl com lfurlwmcrispy prawn pancake this was my least favourite dish there was not anything particularly wrong with it but it lacked layers of flavours that would have brought it up a notch tinyurl com mdrrdpchicken with wine sauce this was such a enjoyable chicken dish it is another example of a dish that allowed the basic ingredient to shine through the wine sauce complimented the chicken without overwhelming it plus the chicken was very tender tinyurl com lyzsbgprawn fried rice i love rice but i tend to prefer steamed rices however if i keep running into fried rices as good as this i may become a convert it was light the prawns were sweet the eggs provided a rich earthy note at some level it was difficult to believe this was a fried dish tinyurl com kcpztlbcold pork i enjoyed the flavours of this dish the lightness of the pork the freshness of the onions the nice touch of the sesame seeds all that being said i would prefer this dish with the pork served hot tinyurl com mchnjprawn dumplings i love prawn dumplings these were very good fresh hot sweet etc tinyurl com lpqrnxia long bao soup dumplings this is the dish that brings a lot of folks to din tai fung they did not disappoint dipped into the vinegar and ginger and then popped into your mouth for a flavour explosion just make sure not to burn yourself tinyurl com mefulri do not know the cost my friends were kind enough to treat me to dinner overall din tai fung is about the food and they delivered for the overall experience i would say this was more   star than  the food definitely warranted  stars the service could be a little more personable and little less rushed but i guess if they did not hurry we would all have to wait a little longer to get our delicious xia long bao,Positive
din-tai-fung,came here during my  week visit to singapore about  times loved their seaweed vegetable salad app the pork dumplings spicy cucumber and the shrimp fried rice there was typically a wait if you came at normal eating hours and even off peak there were always plenty of tables filled up i do like the numbering system and how they call out the tables easier to hear than names being called and lets you not stand in a line like other places in the mall service was typically quick although items came out as they were ready and not necessarily in the order that you would expect them this did not bother me as i was eating alone but might be weird if you are in a group and ordering separately although this is a chain i felt that this location was a nice option for dinner for almost any occasion from date night to casual eating alone i think you have to visit one location of this restaurant if you are visiting singapore,Negative
din-tai-fung,before traveling to singapore for work i checked out some yelp reviews to see what the restaurants close to my hotel offered i am glad i read reviews of din tai fung because i made the effort to find it and ended up going three times during a two week trip my hotel the swissotel was connected to the raffles city mall so that made it very convenient but i still would have made the effort to go back there was usually a line but it cleared quickly and the hostesses provided order sheets and menus so you could decide on your meal before you sat down one of my favorite parts of the experience was the crib they provide for ladies bags and that once you put your bag inside they cover it with a napkin as if the bags are being tucked in for a nap but my most favorite thing were the dumplings these soup dumplings might be the most delightful thing i have ever eaten the sensation of putting one in your mouth and the warm soup bursting out yeah yeah phrasing boom just brings a smile to your face the texture of the dumplings is firm but soft and the soup has great flavor i tried several varieties with the traditional pork being my favorite the shrimp and the chicken were also good but i did not care for the crab very much i also tried the shrimp fried rice and an eggplant side dish and both were great i have seriously been telling everyone about these dumplings since i went on this trip if you are in singapore din tai fung is a must,Positive
din-tai-fung,i dream of din tai fung when i am in the states this place is super consistent and gets it right every time the pork chop and fried rice is a must and obviously if you leave without trying the variety of soup dumplings if not all the soup dumplings you must be from another planet you seriously cannot go wrong here,Positive
din-tai-fung,we were there on the last saturday of the year so it seemed like it was a bit of a mad rush at the centre thankfully there was not the usual long queue at dtf as it was a late lunch we pre ordered at the queue to cut wait time but there was still a wait at the table luckily the beers did not take too long my companions were vegetarians so we only opted for vegetarian dishes and were very pleased with our choices the stir fried dou miao with garlic was outstanding as were the steamed red bean paste buns service was so so staff were not rude but not that friendly either one of our dumpling dishes was forgotten so we had to ask for it and there was a bit of a delay though it was not too long it was a pleasant experience and the flavour of the food is consistent with dtf in hong kong malaysia and sydney,Negative
din-tai-fung,other than the edge breakfast i enjoyed every morning this was my favorite meal in singapore i am now absolutely addicted to dumpling and buns it is almost impossible to find soup dumplings in the us so my friend was on the hunt for some enter din tai fung the soup dumplings were absolutely delicious and i cannot complain about anything else we ate i loved watching them make all of the food while we waited their kitchen is glassed in and you can see them moving all of the trays around in the steam definitely worth the wait,Positive
din-tai-fung,stars for din tai fung the xao long bao soup dumplings were super good they had a chili crab special one that i really enjoyed we also ordered a veggie dish that was just okay and dan dan noodles which were pretty good i recommend sticking to their dumplings service was good atmosphere was good all in all i would recommend trying din tai fung although not sure if it is worth the potentially long lines,Positive
din-tai-fung,taipei singapore and seattle always count on din tai fung to bring their a game especially xlb,Positive
din-tai-fung,i have eaten at the dtf location in arcadia ca in the states plenty of times and i am a big fan for only their trademark pork xlb is and nothing else naturally once i found out that there was a location minutes away from my hotel in singapore i just had to check it out for comparison purposes prices are definitely higher which is no shocking surprise in the us it is around   for a  pc of the juicy pork dumplings in singapore it is closer to   the group of us were not that hungry so we only ordered  total for  people not only do they tack on  per person for tea without even asking but they also automatically added a service charge so it ended up being close to  us dollars not a good value by any means and the xlb is where just about the same compared to the arcadia location if there was a slight difference the skin was slightly thicker and chewier in singapore which i did not mind at all worth a try but not again if i am ever in singapore again,Negative
din-tai-fung,they do not take american express so beware i come here for the dumplings only which are really good so flavorful and juicy after you bite into them i once got the dan dan noodles and did not like at all very little flavor and feel a bit more fast food like one day i came here and the hostess was a little rude and sat couples who came after me and when it was my turn she told me that there was a  min wait even though there were two empty tables in the back i was a party of one that day but still,Positive
din-tai-fung,din tai fung is a great place to take first time visitors to singapore especially when you are on a moderate budget they have great soup dumplings portions are good and it is air conditioned which is so key for foreigners whenever my husband and i are stuck in choosing options for hosting people din tai fung is always our go to choice,Positive
din-tai-fung,the heavy weight champion of soup dumplings while they could have stopped there they did not spectacular noodles amazing starters duck filled spring rolls incredible fried rice get it w pork chop why this place does not have a michelin star is a mystery,Negative
din-tai-fung,i was back in singapore visiting family and attending my brother is wedding and had to get a xiao long bao fix had to we were in the area because there was a little anime festival going on at funan mall and this was the closest thing that served xiao long bao we were seated promptly and politely it was rather cramped you can tell they are trying to maximize space and when there is only  people in your party well but really we are not big so we did not mind rubbing elbows a little wound up chatting a bit to a couple of frenchmen that were dining next to us actually frenchmen you never get frenchmen in phoenix i sometimes forget how urbane singapore is the food we ordered was pretty standard i waffled about getting the truffle xiao long bao but decided against it going instead for the regular order of that plus the signature jiao zi my girlfriend got the dan dan mien i got the zha jiang mien we also shared the pickled shredded vegetables everything was pretty good the skin on the bao thin the broth hot my zha jiang mien was delicious and definitely better than what i could replicate at home mostly it was just a good fix of chinese food and the coveted xiao long bao i do not get a chance to have food like this back in phoenix   stars out of  for sure did not round up as  it is a chain restaurant and  really nothing out of this world good solid fare in a nice air conditioned environment win for me,Positive
din-tai-fung,small location in the basement of the mall the soup dumplings were good but not as good as some of their other locations within singapore,Positive
din-tai-fung,this was the th or th dtf i would eaten at on my current traveling spree and it was very similar to the other dtfs i have had in my life with the exception of branches in shanghai and taipei you know what the deal is here delicious xiaolongbao with different kinds if you are looking for some variety it is not exactly cheap but the quality is pretty good i personally think it is worth it there are also a few other dishes but i did not get to order them this time around we just ordered a lot of different kinds of xlb hahaha,Positive
din-tai-fung,it speaks volume of a chain restaurant that i can return to again and again and again and look the shizz here is foh real and is definitely good so let is not waste words on waxing lyrical i like this branch in general service is almost always good the lines move fast and i have never had a bad experience here food appears promptly and they are a polished operation which cannot be said of every din tai fung i have tried in singapore this is the joshua list of what you must try at din tai fung okay maybe not must try it is my list after all but trust me these are some of the best things on the menu xiao long bao the normal kind with pork xiao long bao with black truffle now i know they are expensive at about  a pop but hot diggidy damn they are good they are worth that  trust you me the dumplings in chili oil and vinegar these are so tasty it is ridonkulous eat them dumplings up and keep a little of the oil and vinegar mix so you can dump it in the double boiled chicken soup with noodles this is the one where the noodles and the soup come separate the noodles are dry in a bowl with spring onion and salt and you are supposed to pour in some soup but wait we have that awesome vinegar chili oil mix still left over pour that in spoon in   spoons of soup and savour also definitely worth trying is the shanghai drunken chicken packed with flavour this is my favourite cold starter item on the menu also generally well liked is the prawn pancake which is crisp seafoody goodness omg i need some xlb right now,Positive
din-tai-fung,hello soupy dumpling you are so amazing and i cannot believe i ate almost two orders on my own why i love you so much the perfect bite size and not hint of greasiness in the broth or skin the thin chewy skin and the super tender meat were amazing the also like the chinese broccoli with garlic and sauce,Positive
din-tai-fung,if you like dim sum do not miss this one have tried this and a second location for this chain ordered a wide variety of their menu offerings and all were great do not miss the soup filled dumplings the noodle dishes etc,Negative
din-tai-fung,breezed right in on a friday afternoon around pm service was a bit slow but i was too excited for my dumplings to care dui mui greens came out first and were not completely pipping hot remaining dumplings followed shortly the truffle xiao long bao was a bit over the top but i would probably order it again since we do not have it in the states chili crab bun was interesting but i am here for the xiao long baos,Negative
din-tai-fung,din tai fung is one of my favourite places to go to for xiao long baos although they lack the novelty of the creative multi flavoured xiao long baos at paradise dynasty they do the normal xiao long baos really well and have their own varieties like chilli crab dumplings pork and crab dumplings red bean paste dumplings etc the dumpling skin is just right in thickness and the broth is delicious the chicken soup is also really tasty as is the beef soup we also really like the fried rice which is one of the best we have had the dou miao is also really commendable and is sold out pretty often by dinner time the prawn beancurd skin rolls are a tad oily and i am not that big a fan of the pork chop but their noodles are quite decent overall a great place for a meal,Positive
din-tai-fung,this place has amazing dumplings i had the veggie dumplings and bun and it was amazing my boyfriend had pork dumplings which he loved as well they also serve complementary hot jasmine green tea with the food the service is fast the kitchen is very hygienic they wear masks and serious hairnets and i totally recommend it if you are looking for a place for a quick bite,Positive
din-tai-fung,world famous dtf there is nothing i can write in this review that someone else has not already written suffice to say the xiaolanpo is one of the best and the pork fat cures any hangover ills expect to wait during peak hours,Negative
din-tai-fung,this is the very first din tai fung we ever ate at and wow we were missing out on one of the world is best foods the xiao long baos here are the best taste just like every other din tai fung even the original ones in taipei we eat only the pork xlb and this places gives you a lot compared to other countries we tried the royal truffle bao and it was ok the pork fried rice is also good and try the tapioca based desserts,Positive
din-tai-fung,dim sum is something that is hard to come by in the states i guess the recipes and ingredients are hard to recreate here but din tai fung is a restaurant i look forward to every time i travel to singapore best soup dumplings ever and almost any other dim sum on their menu is bound to be good do not even think about visiting singapore without stopping by one of their locations i think there is like   locations across the island,Negative
din-tai-fung,din tai fung is a chinese restaurant that is associated with its famous signature xiao long baos steamed pork dumplings but it offers so much more than that dining amidst this brightly lit modern setting will surely give you an enjoyable dining experience their taiwan shrimp and pork oriental wantons with spicy sauce bring a fiery twist to the normal pork dumplings these bite sized dumplings are generously doused with chili oil and black vinegar bringing out the flavor of the pork and shrimp another simple yet fulfilling dish to try is their fried rice with pork chop the fried rice is cooked till fragrant while the pork chop is tender and savory if you seek a heavier meal then the minced meat noodles would satisfy you the noodles are smooth while the saltiness and flavor of the sauce makes it appetizing the food can be a tad oily so be sure to order some chinese tea to flush it down,Positive
din-tai-fung,din tai fung is one of those places that i always fall back on when we do not feel like being creative with our dining choices simply because they can do no wrong their top seller is definitely their xiao long baos which are soup dumplings with pork fillings they explode in your mouth with a soupy broth that tastes both rich and thick at the same time one of the best in singapore one of my recent discoveries was their yam dumplings which are usually served as dessert dumplings it is a sweet dumpling filled with a soft and finely milled yam paste that is not too cloyingly sweet aside from their dumplings they also serve a great bean paste noodles that is mixed with minced pork and tofu to give it a more oriental feel compared to its korean influences their pork chop fried rice which sounds unassuming is also deliciously crispy but thick served with steaming fragrant rice fried with battered eggs service is always as prompt as they can given the perpetual long queues but seating arrangements are always well organized with a numbered system hot chinese tea is also served free flow throughout your meal and continuously filled to the point where you filled obliged to drink several pots before saying no,Positive
din-tai-fung,for a quick and easy and delicious meal this is the place have been in singapore and in shanghai service is always quick though there may be a wait to get a table and the food comes right away and is great,Positive
din-tai-fung,is this the best xiao long bao in the country in the world i do not know and i do not really care because i just like coming here and their other outlets to get my fill of steaming hot soup dumplings spinach with sesame dressing and when i am feeling fancy drunken chicken as the other reviewers have pointed out this place is crowded all the time so expect there to be a bit of a wait once you have ordered though things move quickly without you feeling rushed i wish we had more of the taiwanese menu available here but this is still bar none my favorite xlb place in town,Positive
din-tai-fung,one of the best meals i had in singapore we ordered zha jiang noodles dan dan noodles shanghai dumplings crab normal pickled cucumbers beef cold cuts fried rice with pork vegetarian buns and vegetarian dumplings everything was very good but the crab dumplings were not too memorable service was very good as well this place was still packed at   at night and the mall closes at,Positive
din-tai-fung,din tai fung have made changes to their menu we tasted the dumplings with fish pork shrimp and were surprised how dry they had become the meat was ground course and we swore it had the consistency of ground beef the changes since we started visiting din tai fung the past  years has been a decline and we have started looking for hong kong style dumplings service was prompt and adequate and would go back if it were convenient for quick meal,Positive
jumbo-seafood,jumbo cooked crab and seafood had a great time with our group visiting from around the world service and food was excellent and i would recommend the peppered crab location has an outdoor patio and views of the ocean set in a semicircle park,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i was surprised to find out that this restaurant chain is a public company listed in singapore stock market they must have perfected the process and quality of food across their restaurants the evening rush with full occupancy on all  floors and outside seating area showed that the customers appreciated it the famous pepper and chili crabs lived up to their hypes all other foods were fantastic every dish that we ordered was good this is a must visit while in singapore the only complaint i had was lack of service after all the dishes were served we basically were ignored the final check came to about us  for  people not cheap in singapore standard but worth it,Positive
jumbo-seafood,singapore is known for very good global fusion plates it is one of a few countries where everything works infrastructure wise and everyone gets along i e  cultures coexist indian chinese malay indonesian decently one of the famed dishes in this beautiful country is singaporean chilli that is right two ls crab there are tomes which document the popularity of chilli crab so i was curious to sample this dish jumbo seafood is one of the best preparers of chilli crab we did not have time to search out kek seafood another source for good chilli crab so jumbo had to do for this trip location wise there is a jumbo seafood in many parts of the city so it is accessible i also saw a jumbo in icon siam bangkok so jumbo is expanding too we ordered a crab about  us for  and while the crab was presented nicely and smelled awesome i failed to appreciate this famous dish for the following reasons first crabs are imported from malaysia or indonesia i cannot remember which country and it is reflected in the price the chilli crab comes with a cloyingly sweet sauce with a hint of heat spice i am definitely not into sweet main courses it also came with deliciously light and pillowy sweet again buns a k a man tou to sop up the sauce it gave my palate a  sweet with a whisper of heat honestly i was a bit disoriented sweet is dessert for me not a main course maybe it was an off night and more sugar was added than less maybe i am spoiled with phenom indo vietnamese malaysian chinese cambodian lao korean thai chefs educating my palate in los angeles maybe willing to cut some slack here but if this dish should be soulfully sweet then that was the last time i will have had the famous chilli crab i cannot claim the crabmeat tasted sweet because it did not the creature traveled from another country had it been caught in the nearest river or sea it would have been sweet the other dishes we ordered were very good however prawns with golden salted egg mee goreng malay style kang kong fried rice service was very good tip jumbo seafood is also a tourist destination prices are high even for singapore i would come to this location if you were to visit as it is on the water if you like h check out the yelpista pix,Positive
jumbo-seafood,sticking with singapore classics you definitely need to visit jumbo seafood for amazing chilli crab jumbo serves delicious flavourful singapore seafood and other meat dishes the chilli crab is a definite must try although it may be a bit spicy the flavours are extremely delicious and very unique for those who are allergic to peanuts though the black pepper crab is just as flavourful and is an awesome replacement the crab is so succulent tender and soaks up all the sauce another must try is the mocha ribs and the drunken prawns the mocha ribs have a slightly sweet hint but it works well with the moist tender pork meat the drunken prawns are just as mouthwatering you may think that there will be a lot of alcohol flavour but surprisingly there is only a slight alcohol taste and more chicken essence than anything the prawns are also juicy and cooked to perfection they are infused with the delicious chicken and alcohol flavour other than the food the restaurant has an outstanding view of the ocean and has excellent service they are also very accommodating with food allergies and have managers ready to explain all the dishes or provide you with suggested dishes that can fit your specific diet if you visit singapore jumbo is a must try,Positive
jumbo-seafood,there are so many different places that that serve chili crab and so many different ways people try to infuse chili crab into dishes after a fair amount of internet research i decided to go with jumbo which would provide a nicer restaurant experience and would have great chili crab we were not disappointed i made a reservation through chope which is highly advisable particularly on a weekend night i did not see many people queuing but all of the tables were full we had an early reservation and were able to secure an outdoor table where we could enjoy the sunset and view but beware of mosquitos we ordered a chili crab a medium sized one which was plenty for the three of us a side of vegetables steamed rice and chow mein the chili crab was delicious and has the right balance of heat and sweetness definitely order steamed rice to drench your rice in the crab and sauce the chow mein was underwhelming,Positive
jumbo-seafood,wow we heard about this place from a electric sales person here in singapore he was absolutely right best sweet chili crab ever service was great food was fantastic if i lived here i am sure i would be her at least once or twice a week guarantee jeff hom,Positive
jumbo-seafood,a singapore institution for seafood definitely get the chili crab it is a giant crab served in a sweet spicy sauce also get the man tou pan fried bread to dip in the crab sweet spicy sauce quality of the crab is excellent sweet fresh crab that goes well with the sauce the black pepper crab is not as good though so perhaps stick to the chili crab for jumbo the seafood is fresh in general we also enjoyed the ginger and scallion prawn and steamed fish,Positive
jumbo-seafood,thank you julia tran for a great meal it was truly special julia took careful care of you of our kids that had allergy issues she made his dishes first before all the others once she took the initiative order she checked with the chef on the ingredients and to warn him to wash the woks before preparing these special dishes i noticed she was wearing a hair net after talking with the chef this made me think there is a high standard level of cleanliness in the kitchen all the dishes we ordered were equally great plus she order exactly the correct amount so nothing was left for  people we have no idea how much we ordered of each item so we are now anticipating the bill what did we get chili and pepper crab i preferred the black pepper both both were good i liked the vegetable dishes the produce is very fresh one was chinese broccoli and scallops and the other dragon greens mushrooms and garlic cereal shrimp okay but others liked it beef and onion fried cod cubed and shrimp friend rice lastly the mini buns were light and the outside crust lightly crunchy with about  sodas and  service the total price was  for  or about  a person the service was fantastic it was definitely worth it,Positive
jumbo-seafood,make no mistake this is a tourist trap back in the days before jumbo seafood ipo on the stock exchange prices were more affordable reasonable right now expect exorbitant prices of the seafood dishes i went there with the family  of us and ordered steam prawns chili crap salted egg crap sambal kang kong fried baby squid chinese donut fried mee goreng hot plate tofu desserts with a jug of beer total bill came to  unfortunately this will be my last visit to jumbo seafood,Positive
jumbo-seafood,came here on a monday night due to a recommendation from a local friend and this place was packed we did not have a reservation but luckily were seated within  minutes we ordered both the famous chili crabs as well as the black pepper crabs they will provide you with bibs which were an absolute must because the sauce can easily get everywhere the sauce from the chili crab was perfectly seasoned rich and thick yet not too spicy tons of flavor imbued in every bite i simply could not stop eating it then the black pepper crabs arrived and i started devouring those too although i did find the kick of the pepper to be actually a tad bit stronger than the chili version if you make it out here you wo not go wrong with either dish but just to be safe you should definitely order both,Positive
jumbo-seafood,as many have already said you must try chili crab in singapore and every time i am here this is the place i go it is a large crab some of the pieces require a bit of patience to get the meat out but wow is it delicious get the fried rolls to dip into the sauce in fact grab a spoon and just shove that delicious sauce into your mouth it is that good i also tried the sambal shrimp which was delicious as well with plump shrimp and little pieces of pineapple in it hotel called in a reservation and i was seated immediately warning it is messy,Positive
jumbo-seafood,went back again this year and it was excellent again looking forward to the next visit,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i believe this is the only one that takes reservations arrived on schedule n sat down promptly ordered the recommemd chili crab and bamboo muscle cereal shrimp the chili crab delicious as everyone described cereal shrimp was too sweet for my taste overall a bit pricy but worth the try,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crab it is first time in singapore and the hype is real about chili crab went with a few colleagues and wanted to know what the fuss was the restaurant itself was full of people locals tourist people celebrating etc definitely a crowd almost every dish we had was superb and full of flavor ambiance was great and decent service it is pricey however could honestly just eat the bread dipped into the chili crab sauce all day the chili crab itself was very delicious and you can kind of understand why it is a must try also got the prawns with cereal i was kind of unsure about this dish but i am glad i ate it very different but unique and taste great the golden phoenix chicken one of my favorites,Positive
jumbo-seafood,signature chili crab was a wondrous experience great service too and fast so many side items also hit the mark superb bamboo clams tender and succulent they were overshadowed by the crab which was mega fresh and meaty save the crab for last pro tip if you leave this place hungry you are doing it wrong,Positive
jumbo-seafood,we came with a table of   for a big family dinner and the service was extremely slow we came on a sunday night for dinner dishes came out one by one and the table would be empty for a good   minute between dishes this is not typically for a family style asian restaurant the staff and kitchen usually time the dishes better so there is a continuous flow of food most of the food was cold when arrived but very flavorful the main dish was the black pepper crab and it was quite delicious very nice pepper taste that left your mouth tingling a bit with spice would have tasted better if the dish was warmer overall food is not bad the reason for the  is due to the slow service and cold food i hope this restaurant can staff up and be more efficient with the dining experience,Positive
jumbo-seafood,great location on waterfront make a reservation as it is a destination for many tourists and locals celebrating events you have to try the chili crab and or black pepper crab huge tasty and enough for   folks if you speak mandarin it helps we had one person in group who did and made ordering and service better,Positive
jumbo-seafood,on our last night in singapore my boyfriend is mother and sister took us to jumbo seafood where we had a beautiful waterfront view although i love crab my boyfriend is not a fan but we still decided to go because our new friends in hong kong raved about trying pepper and or chili crab we ordered chili crab fried cod fish with spicy sauce scallops wrapped in yam ring broccoli with scallops steamed white buns and deep fried bunsthe chili crab was wonderful the crab we received a portion size for three people was the largest crab i have ever seen certainly fitting considering the name of the restaurant i am not usually a fan of filling up on bread but it was difficult to resist dipping the steamed buns in the chili crab sauce and this is was after i ate spoonfuls on top of my rice so much flavor the broccoli with scallops were fine but the scallops wrapped in yam were even better my boyfriend almost decided to get a second order of them finally the fried cod fish was delicious i would order that again as well our bill ended up around sgd   if you are not opposed to taking a day trip to malaysia possible via bus car or taxi we were told you can get much more pepper or chili crab for much cheaper there regardless i highly recommend you check this place out if you are in singapore extra tips and fyis there is no ac make reservations if you want to avoid a long wait during certain days or times the menu has plenty of pictures and english to help guide your ordering chili crab can be quite messy i recommend using the disposable bibs they give out do not be afraid to flag down any server you see if you need something if you have trouble breaking through the huge claws or other parts of the crab you can put them on a plate and ask the server to have the kitchen break them for you you do not want any going to waste,Positive
jumbo-seafood,came here my last day in singapore since i felt like chili crab is an obligated must eat this place has a huge outdoor seating with quite minimum wait service was great as our server even helped us to crack the crab more onto the food we got the more expensive alaskan deep sea crab cuz there was a promotion the dish came like warm this was not my first time eating chili crab in jumbo or no signboard and luke warm crab was not satisfying the chili sauce was amazing as it seems like they put broken crab meat in it overall i think jumbo or no signboard have both going downhill in terms of quality maybe next time chili crab should no longer be my must eat,Positive
jumbo-seafood,when in singapore you must try chilli crab or atleast that is what any guide book seems to insist suppressing all scepticism i took a visiting friend to jumbo which is one of the four chilli crab meccas here all lined conveniently next to each other along east coast park we got one chilli crab to share between two of us which cost around  no chilli crab is complete without deep fried buns to mop up the gravy and jumbo is are just sheer perfection crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside with just a slight sweetness to them at this point i need to throw up my hands and admit that yes jumbo is serves some pretty damn good chilli crab the gravy is delicious rich and thick the best part is the sharp kick to it at the end i was expecting it to be a lot spicier than it was but it had too much flavour packed into it to make up for it the crab itself was juicy and tender we struggled to get all the flesh out of the shell but it is worth prying out every little bit the atmosphere is also incredibly relaxing especially if you snag an outside table right next to the ocean the staff were all very prompt and efficient we were the last ones to leave the restaurant but they made no motion to hurry us and even gave us a  discount at the end for no reason my only gripe is the very small vegetarian selection which is somewhat understandable at a seafood restaurant my mother got rice with vegetable stir fry which came in a tiny portion costing  total rip off for a very average tasting dish,Positive
jumbo-seafood,never disappoints excellent chili crab and even better pepper crab do not miss the deep fried baby octopus sit outside and enjoy the balmy weather and the pitchers of tiger beer the food here is always a highlight,Positive
jumbo-seafood,gotta try the pepper crab i know everyone says chili crab but love the pepper crab the noodles and  is yum yum a must try singapore classic,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this restaurant is very close to the airport we all loved foods here especially crab and bbq fish reasonable price but it is difficult to get a taxi in the night,Positive
jumbo-seafood,best of singapore food both black pepper and chili crab prawns too  lb crab from sri lanka,Positive
jumbo-seafood,we visited jumbo seafood with a group of friends to finally try the famous chili crab we also got black pepper crab clams and some veggies as well the food was tasty and the bib provided was absolutely necessary i was a mess i actually liked the pepper crab more than the chili crab because it was too sweet for my tastes the fresh coconut was the perfect choice to combat some of the spice the setting of the restaurant next to the beach allowed for a nice breeze the place is great for groups with large tables that featured turn tables that are ideal for family style meals it was approximately  per person which was reasonable for the amount of crab we ordered for the price i expect a bit more upscale ambiance and more attentive service my official rating would be   out of  stars if we have got a large group of guests looking to enjoy the ocean and a singaporean traditional meal i will likely take them here,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crab with extra sauce with man tao and black pepper crab so good i was quite surprised at the chili crab because i was not sure what to expect other than i hear singaporeans chili crab is really good and that it was i found it to be the perfect balance of taste and spicy it was quite good and the black pepper was a good flavor too definitely was a messier meal and expect to get your hands finger licking dirty with yummy sauce the crab was fresh and good quality the fresh prawns were also quite good and plump and we had an  appetizers one was scallops and taro while the second was a tofu dish and a salted fish chicken fried rice service was not the best but fine just had to wave them down for a little location is great because here is indoor covered outdoor seating and it is on the oceanfront so you can have a nice view as well as walk along the water before or after your meal would definitely return and bring guests that visit too tip reservations so you do not have to queue but even if you do it is not too bad if you go early tip  bring some napkins and do not wear white in case you get it dirty when you use your hands for the crab,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this place is so much better than no sign board the chili crab was on point the flavor the sauce was not too sweet and not too spicy i loved the crab was really fresh the view is not bad either i will definitely be back when i am in singapore,Positive
jumbo-seafood,overrated chili crab was okay was not as fresh as the hype would have lead us to believe breaded scallops were elegant mantou bread was nom worthy and the fried rice was great and the service was quite decent we had a reservation inside and hence ate inside but i think outside is the better experience we had some amazing food and from the popularity of the jumbo chain i assume they are capable of excellent food but for whatever reason our experience was decidedly so so as soon as the signature dish came out we even made it a point to come to this specific location as friends said this one was the best maybe they were wrong,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crab enough said there is nothing like this back in the states so if you are visiting singapore i strongly recommend a visit to jumbo seafood things to keep in mind when planning dinner here the wait time is longggggg be sure to call for a reservation or show up really early to put your name down if you are at the waterfront note that there are two restaurants within  minutes walking distance of each other i stopped by the busier location first at the end of the canal and was told the wait would be  hours long i found some wifi and noticed another location  minutes down the canal and walked that way to kill some time i had to walk under a bridge but once i got to the other side i found the other location which only had a  minute wait things to order chili crab be aware that i will cost you   usd per crab pepper crab garlic ong choy veggies man tou bread rolls asian style,Negative
jumbo-seafood,after going to the jumbo at clarke quay and being blessed with an extra night in singapore of course i would choose to have jumbo as my last meal in this great food city this location is right on the water similar to clark quay but not the river the ocean breeze that night was quite cool and a pleasant change to the heat of the day we were seated right away and requested to be seated outside so we could enjoy the weather better than being in  degrees and snow in nj the food was great and just as i had remembered it from two nights before this time we went with the black pepper crab and chili crab again but also tried the salted egg prawns and the tofu dish again everything did not have a chance once it hit the table each nook and cranny of the crabs was cleaned up combined with the fried buns and chili sauce as it was my last night in singapore i thought it would be good to buy the mix to take back to the states to have a crack at making it myself one day startlingly impressive food makes you eat beyond capacity,Positive
jumbo-seafood,my cousin is family took us to this place which seemed less touristy than clarke quay but still massively crowded if you are in the cbd i would not travel all the way out here unless you wanted to check out the east coast park and beaches first off this place is outdoors and hot af and it is very close to the strait of singapore so it does have a nice ocean breeze it is definitely pricey like   per crab but any crab that is damn near a kilo will be much different than the usa blue crabs or king snow crab legs they give you a bib for a reason while i did enjoy the chilli crab the black pepper crab is even better apparently the ish is to get deep fried mantou those white chinese bread things which you can then dip in the sauce a little too rich for me i prefer rice they ran out of razor clams we also ordered cereal prawns and deep fried crispy squid cereal prawns are unique i was not a huge fan of the squid it did not taste bad or anything just not my ish  stars only because it is very much like a factory and i felt like the waitrons were trying to constantly upsell with more food than needed special order desserts apparently they take a while and threatening that if you do not order now it will take an hour that being said there are a ton of diners so it is somewhat plausible i am just not that used to it,Negative
jumbo-seafood,this was my nd time in the same day eating at jumbo i first ate at the one in clarke quay and then when the boss flew in he wanted to go to this one we were seated quite quickly due to our reservation and it was outside the restaurant closer to the water i did not really like our table because it was pretty close to where everybody goes to smoke so i occasionally had the odor of cigarette smoke while eating but it was not too bad the chili crab and satays were very good but the black pepper crab was too peppery the cereal prawns had a lot of cereal but not too much prawn the fish in banana leaf was decent overall it was pretty decent but i would not go out of my way to go back,Negative
jumbo-seafood,the usual singaporean go to spot for seafood the east coast branch is by far the most popular on the island i am guessing it is because of its complimentary location near the sea adds to one is seafood dining experience it is super crowded on weekend evenings do not attempt to go without a booking especially if it is a public holiday weekend overall jumbo does not disappoint it serves quality seafood amidst a casual and family friendly environment singaporean families across generations think aunty uncle cousins gather here for good seafood food  pepper crab awesome get your bibs ready it can get messy  chili crab sauce man tou i love their man tous fried buns it is fried to golden perfection crispy on the outside but soft smooth on the inside i could eat a plate of these they are pretty small in size especially dipped in chili sauce tip you can order the chili crab sauce without having to order the whole crab itself so you can have your crab in another sauce black pepper and still get to enjoy the wholesome goodness of dipping your man tous in the chili sauce double happiness  fried you tiao love these are fried doughs stuffed with fish paste it may sound strange to foreigners but they are heavenly a must try for sure  mee goreng good a little spicy though be warned  mix vegetable mushrooms good the mushrooms were so fresh  steam prawns with egg love the prawn was so fresh sweet it comes served with a sweet black sauce which goes so well with the prawns i could eat this all day service very efficient,Positive
jumbo-seafood,first make a reservation avoid the lines still not a fan of the sneaky charging of peanuts tea etc which i guess is a singaporean thing anyway the black pepper crab is very nice i think the chili is better but nice to have alternatives regarding the venue you can have a nice stroll on ecp afterwards i suppose if you can get the outdoor seating that would be more charming jumbo is a must visit if you are visiting singapore,Positive
jumbo-seafood,in my many trips to singapore i always stop into jumbo just so i can indulge myself with the best they have to offer what is the best you might ask well the chilli crab is one the second is the pitcher of lime juice and third is the fresh rolls that they offer when you get the chilli crab and the rolls are in front of you i got  words for you dunk the rolls get those fresh hot buns covered in the chilli crab sauce and let it take you to cloud  you canalso requestfor them to giveyou bibswhich ishighly recommended as the seafood had a tendency to go flying around to top it off there are also outdoor seating available for you to enjoy the oceanfront via while eating during the day or harbor lights at night either way it is a nice perk especially for you romantics out there big props i do not give out  stars to really but jumbo has done something right here,Positive
jumbo-seafood,amazing food cant go wrong with anything you order if you are not picky service is fast but need some english language improvement,Positive
jumbo-seafood,came here for the pepper crab and chili crab just get the pepper crab it is far superior to the chili crab also do not order the special menu for  people or  people it is very expensive and they give you some weird stuff for non singaporeans that are not very tasty i would just order off the menu only,Negative
jumbo-seafood,absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in the world and i do mean the entire world when i lived in singapore we came to the east coast jumbo regularly and always brought out of town guests the one on the east cost is the best imho there is nothing fancy about this restaurant come to sit by the ocean on uncomfortable plastic chairs enjoy some cold beer and devour as many crabs as you can the awesome jumbo experience is very simple and consists of only five elements so anyone can execute this plan here it is  sit outside not inside order beer and then keep ordering it throughout the meal you will see why shortly  order lots of chili crabs order a ton of man tou buns fried not steamed  after you are done with the first  things order sago for dessert even if the waitstaff gives you a hard time about it i believe chili crab may be one of nature is most perfect food substances the crab is huge meaty and sweet the sauce is beyond compare rich tangy and oh so spicy and extra good when you sop it up with the man tou kind of like little savory doughnuts lot is of fried spicy goodness there order double the number of buns they suggest i seem to prefer a higher bun to sauce ratio then is standard i see many reviewers indicate you should go with black pepper crab while that is a fine dish i have always preferred the sauciness of chili crab but try them both you cannot go wrong also remember to wear clothes that can get soiled those crabs are messy but that is half the fun finally let me put in a word for sago it is kind of like cold sweetened coconut soup with melon balls and ice shavings delicious refreshing and the perfect antidote to your burning lips from the yummy chili crab my father almost passed out from delight the first time he had sago here in short when i next make the long long long trip from chicago to singapore i will be heading to jumbo,Positive
jumbo-seafood,gross disgusting icky these are just some of the words you will be using to describe your eating experience at jumbo not because of the food no no but because of how messy you will get eating the delicious drool inducing chili crab this is some of the best stuff on earth seriously if you come here for nothing else you will be quite happy the crab is really fresh and the sauce is just so he right amount of spicy it is very messy and finger lickin good we also had the cereal prawn that was just a bit too sweet it tastes very similar to coconut shrimp and also the yam covered scallops they were also very good you obviously have to have beer with your chili crab so make sure to grab a pitcher of tiger this is the third or fourth time here from america i will always come back here to eat i love it so much i will be coming here for years to come i wish they sold the chili sauce by the gallon i would just drink it,Positive
jumbo-seafood,one star for the food the steam prawns over cooked moreover steam prawns should come out first instead last very pricey there was cockroach crawled on my wife leg the seafood horfun was tasteless when asked for feedback online of course we give feedback both online and verbal but they did nothing to win us back,Negative
jumbo-seafood,went to jumbo on my first trip to singapore and i am already trying to plan another vacation back out here just to get the chili crab came here with a large party for dinner and sat outside it was really nice to sit along the water and the weather was just right no jacket needed and it was cool nice breeze good break from all the humidity ordered and sampled a variety of things and was not disappointed in any thing by far the chili crab was my favorite saw you could buy a mix to take home and make yourself but i did not in fear it would not turn out the same in california we have different types of crab so was almost positive it would not turn out the same it is also really good if you dip your bread into the chili sauce the tangy sweet spicy and savory sauce it comes with is to diiiiiie for devastated theres nothing like this in the us pepper crab delicious perfect blend of a spicy and sweetness of a crabboiled live shrimp comes in a wine soup get about  per person chicken beef kabobs tastes good if you dip it in their peanut sauce malaysia dry noodle reminded me to be similar to a spaghetti with seafood in it mango not sure if its the right season or if its just always good but the mango is soft and sweet perfect way to end your meal ate a lot more but cannot remember the names if i can remember the names i will update this review accordingly staff is great and attentive always there to switch out your messy plates and bring more stuff to the table as needed free wifi for restaurant guests on the table you will see the wifi name and password,Positive
jumbo-seafood,not sure why this place is so highly recommended it is bloody awful probably the worst place we have ever eaten at it is touristy overpriced and actually not very good at all singaporeans tell me it is just for the tourists and they do a lot of advertising to be well known we actually felt sick after eating here nothing was really fresh or healthy and it was just your typical chinese food covered in sticky gooey sauce two of the dishes we ordered had pictures on the menu and they looked nothing like it when they arrived the cod was certainly frozen and not fresh and the deep fried squid tasted of rotten fish i know this sounds unbelievable for such a well known restaurant but i can tell you the other english people sat close by to us were also not happy and arrived after us and left before us so we were not alone in our thinking our taxi driver laughed when we told him we hated it and he told us we should have eaten at the eastcoast hawker centre as it is better more authentic and cheaper i wish we would known that before we spent a fortune here definitely not a recommend,Negative
jumbo-seafood,when in singapore you must partake in one of the island is most famous dishes chilli crab tangy a tad sweet savory and spicy it hits all of your important taste buds and leaves you wanting more it is messy so get in there with your fingers and dig in literally order some fried buns mantou to soak up some of that delicious chilli sauce and you have got a fantastic meal it gets pricey but it is worth it a few tips for those non natives that i learned the hard way there are no napkins how you are expected to eat this crab with no provided napkins is beyond me but that is how it is done in sg stop by a convenience store and pick up a multi pack of tissues since that is what everyone uses for napkins the restaurant provides you with a finger bowl to rinse your hands while eating if all else fails watch the people around you and enjoy,Positive
jumbo-seafood,made reservations online and got seated right away despite long line not sure if it is bc it was only two of us bc everyone in line had a reservation we ordered the famous chili crab both fried and steamed mantou bread and the fried frog legs in onion or something and the famous beer way overpriced hubby loved the chili crab slurped every last but up it was too sweet for me i wish i got the black pepper one instead the bread helped get the sauce off it was my first time having frog and i loved it would come back just for that,Negative
jumbo-seafood,big generous portions of fresh seafood is what you will find here we tried the iconic chilli crab very messy but what a delicious mess ask for the cute little buns to mop up that killer sauce the buns themselves are soft like pillows the fried tilapia with mango salsa is really flavourful and does not feel too heavy despite being fried wash it all down with a thai coconut,Positive
jumbo-seafood,tried the black pepper crab and also the chili crab i love the flavor and wish i could get more the only problem was i broke out in a semi rash mode not sure why but without that happening this place is a must,Positive
jumbo-seafood,looking for a late evening meal on a long layover in singapore hours posted are until midnight arrived at   after a  uber ride i was told they had taken their last order and was refused service even though there were at least  customers still eating i own a restaurant and this is one of my pet peeves we serve until  minutes after the posted closing time if you want to close at  just post an  closing time,Negative
jumbo-seafood,if you could give  stars after longing for a nice evening seaside in the nearby hawker center and finding out it is closed due the to spring cleaning who would have known we went to a well known seafood place with chili crab specialities place is clean with wipes and bowls to clean ones hands a lady came to pour us some tea which we found out was not complementary after talking to her for  minutes so we gallantly denied the tea the main waiter came and took our order we were not sure how big the portions were so we asked for how much people the medium portion is meant   he said but we wanted to share by  so we took the   first our friend got his fried fish which came pretty late so we shared that his side order would not arrive for the next  minutes our dish came and is meant for one person with a small stomach trying to find the waiter without success we got pretty angry but decided not to do anything about it when the side dish came after  times asking again we shared that as well maybe we should have ordered the sin lobster maybe than we would have been treated like real customers,Negative
jumbo-seafood,delicious food cool sea breeze semidarkness it was close to midnight and our second or third dinner of the day a perfect jumbo experience we ordered a chili crab and a prawn dish which i can no longer remember the crab meat was succulent and sweet drenched in a thick sauce that was tangy spicy sweet all at once i could eat that sauce by the spoonful but better to sop it up with golden fried buns service was efficient and friendly,Positive
jumbo-seafood,worth it for the chili crab alone but a really cool experience overall wonderful views breeze at dusk plus non stop service rotating dishes of massive variety if you order right all delivered with a relaxed fun vibe even though the joint is pretty big crowded disclaimer be prepared to get a bit messy,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crab if you are visiting singapore you have probably been told that you need to try it jumbo is one of the more famous chains which serve this singaporean dish the other is longbeach the chilli crab is a little sweet a little spicy and while the crab itself is good it is the sauce that really stands out order a few of the fried mantou buns on the side and get ready to soak up all that saucy goodness trust me you will need more mantou than you think for what you pay about  a kg it is pricey a crab will be anywhere between   and it is not a whole lot of food but hey when in singapore the cereal prawn  or so is also really good make sure you order it with the shell off breaded in a slightly sweet and crunchy cereal breading it is well worth a try and do not be afraid of wearing the bib for the crab ask for it if they do not offer even the locals do it,Positive
jumbo-seafood,delicious food great service and a beautiful view of the ocean what more could you want the black pepper crab is pretty much a standard order here i have not tried it anywhere else so i cannot say if it is the best one out there but it is certainly delicious their other seafood items are excellent as well and they can be prepared in pretty much any style you like i am personally a big fan of the garlic prawns the steamed cod and the yam scallops these are especially fun and very unique i would suggesting skipping the meat and rice dishes since their specialty is seafood and it can get a bit pricey   per person be sure to make a reservation before you go since it is usually pretty crowded it is a great place to go with a group they have lots of big round tables to accommodate and that can probably bring the cost per person down if you plan on going here more than once i also suggest signing up for their rewards program you will get a  discount on weekends  on weekdays and a free birthday cake from bakerzin any day in the month of your birthday make sure you call  days in advance though the card costs  but you get that money back as credit and you will definitely end up saving more than that so go there once see if you like it and if you think you will be back there ever again sign up for the card,Positive
jumbo-seafood,ordered the chili crab and black pepper crab and noodles and seafood soup plus a veggie dish and the beggars stew the food was all tasty but lacked in spice the shrimp in the food was small the biggest problem was the service we did not get rice until we asked  times and never got the chili sauce or hot sauce we kept asking for the chili crab never came out until we were done with everything else on the table by then way too late as it was obvious we were ready to leave and not too happy you would think at  per crab they would treat you with a little more respect,Negative
jumbo-seafood,the seafood was very jumbo as the name promised a little too big in areas but i dealt great place to go if you need a little aphrodisiacs in your life,Positive
jumbo-seafood,if you like to experience a new place through its food then jumbo is a singapore establishment you must try there are six in the area but my favorite is the east coast seafood centre location mostly because its an excuse to get away from downtown but all of them or good you will find the restaurant to be chaotic crowded and filled with locals and tourists alike the food is served family style and is often messy but very good there is lots to choose from and while the staff speaks limited english it is not hard to order i recommend reservations as it can get very crowed you are hotel concierge can help you out there seafood centre is a   minutes cab ride from downtown you really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu but the the black pepper or chili crab are must try items,Positive
jumbo-seafood,when i heard jumbo seafood i was not all that excited to eat dinner there because i am not a very big fan of seafood but this place definitely changed my mind i heard singapore is known for their spicy crabs so of course we had to go somewhere really authentic to get it this restaurant has a really nice bay view but it was raining that day so we could not sit outside to enjoy the scene so the food there was  of us and we ordered what seemed like everything on the menu so that we can try a little of everything we got the spicy crab and the peppered crab which i guess for a non seafood eater was pretty decent although i still would not go out of my way to eat crab my family really enjoyed it since they are seafood lovers i do have to agree that it is probably the most flavorful crab i have ever tasted to be honest what i loved most about the meal was the little buns that came with the crabs it really was just white dough with a little sugar but it was so soft and chewy and i think i probably had ten pieces all by myself it was an overall good meal but because i do not really like seafood i probably do not have the best judgment one little boo boo was that they messed up our dessert and gave us a  people portion instead of a single serving like we asked and ended up just not giving us anything in the end after we waited for it foreverrrr the service was not great but i guess we were a pretty loud annoying group with two babies that anyone would find hard to deal with,Negative
jumbo-seafood,amazing chilli crab the fried mantao are also a must if you get the chilli crab because they taste so great together the service is not very attentive and you have to call a waiter if you need something since they do not check up on you but that is understandable since the restaurant is so packed make sure to make a reservation or you might have to wait a while sitting outside when the sun is setting is great the heat is combatted by the wind so you wo not melt if you want good lighting though sit inside because the lighting after dark comes mostly from the large red sign that makes everything tinted red,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crab was nice and spicy and pretty good very expensive for what you get though the cereal shrimp was yummy as well as the scallops with broccoli my favorite was the dried mini donut like breads that i used to sop up the chile crab sauce,Positive
jumbo-seafood,ahhh east coast parkway ahhh jumbo ahhh chili crab outdoor seating on patio tables and chairs large fans and a nice sea breeze to keep you cool while your mouth heats up popular place and it is easy to see why,Positive
jumbo-seafood,chili crabs black pepper crabs my singaporian friend said this was the best place to get them and while i did not try them anywhere else i will take her word for it they were delicious here get the mango drink and enjoy outside with a beautiful ocean view,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the last couple of times we were in singapore hubby and i went to long beach which is next door to jumbo but we decided to try jumbo this time because we wanted to wear the jumbo bib we also usually get chilli crab but decided to try the black pepper crab this time which was awesome and so was the bamboo clams and sambal kangkong all this only cost us sg  which is much less than what we would pay in australia glad we came here just a tip get here early or you will be waiting a while before you get a table oh and do not expect good service,Positive
jumbo-seafood,if you travel to singapore this has to be a stop for you get the chili crab we got three varieties its always crowded so be prepared but they will serve you a beer while you wait we chose to sit at a group table that seats about  people which was a great night we sat with two other families and had a great time do not be shy and talk with your table mates we had a great time talking with both families it was a great experience the crab dishes are wonderful and full of flavor well worth the price we tried a variety of seafood appetizers and all were very good we left stuffed plenty of wait staff on hand to take care of you,Positive
jumbo-seafood,rumour has it that jumbo serves the best black pepper crab in town and i have been there enough times to say that their black pepper crab has got mojo the pepper sauce manages to seep into the meat and coat it enough so that you get a hit of peppery goodness with every mouthful of crab there is other places that serve black pepper crab and you can only taste the pepper on the shell but more often than not jumbo gets it right i wont jump the gun and say this is the best ever black pepper crab only because i havent gone on a black pepper crab spree to find the ultimate one i would say this is the benchmark,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i rarely give  stars for restaurants jumbo has delicious food and a great atmosphere we did not order any of their special crab on our last visit but everything else was perfectly cooked and flavorful pretty good service too a bit on the expensive side and not close to home so we will only go here every  months or so,Positive
jumbo-seafood,jumbo did not fail to deliver a yummy chilli crab famous in singapore for a reason deliciousness,Negative
jumbo-seafood,the chili crab is an absolute must for crab lovers when visiting singapore it is one of the most delicious dishes you can possibly eat and possibly the messiest as you do not want to leave even a small morsel of crab behind the crab is perfectly seasoned in a garlic ginger chili sauce that complements the taste of crab does not over power so the taste of crab comes through there is so much of it you will want to have it over rice the cost justifies the quality of the dish,Positive
jumbo-seafood,jumbo seafood is definitely a must see for tourists and locals the food is fresh service is outstanding and we actually happen to be at the restaurant when gordon ramsey was visiting if he came to the restaurant it must be good,Positive
jumbo-seafood,love this place ok so i have not had chili crab everywhere but this place is the best,Positive
jumbo-seafood,when we have out of town guests we take them to jumbos on east coast or red house at robertson quay if we are short on time jumbos on the water is a fantastic experience getting the bibs and seeing the armada of ships vying for trade lanes both the chili crab and pepper crab are consistently perfect tasting even though jumbos is always full they have figured out a way to optimize the space so that the turnover happens at the same rate as people queuing up so we have never had to wait for more than  minutes to pass the time check out the water skiing park next door if you have to wait we have gone to jumbos at clarke quay also and it is great as well atmosphere is just different more yuppie expat very casual atmosphere and big round tables bring your wet wipes roll up your sleeves and do not expect good lovin tonight as you will reek in a good way of garlic,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,this is the prefect place for some late night dumplings it is almost am in singapore and i was so hungry i guess hanging out with friends will do that it does not hurt to soak up and beer either this place is quick not the best dumplings i have had but the service is good and there are pretty tasty i love pork so i always get that with a side of veggies depending on the time of morning since that is when i come it cane be a bit busy with people eating but tonight morning was not too bad,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,stopped by here when i visited little india flavors are quite good and filling without it being overwhelmingly heavy also cash only they close for a few hours to prep for dinner i really wanted to try a few dishes on their dinner menu but never got a chance to go back i can imagine this being a good place for a late night grub worth visiting and giving a try if you are in the area,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,i saw great reviews about this dim sum restaurant so i decided to give them a try however it was over rated we got there early so we did not have to queue in line it was great we were seated right after they opened at  i was impressed that this place was pretty tech savvy for a dim sum restaurant we scanned a qr code to order on the smartphone typically i am used to picking my dim sum from a cart or ordering on a piece of paper i am giving them three stars because none of our dishes came out hot all of the food that came out was either warm or cold again the dishes should have been hot i was pretty disappointed,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,very popular dim sum place they have three stores next to each other which they open based on demand we arrived right after  am when they were opening and had no trouble finding a spot to sit we ordered an array of dim sum plates which were good and pretty standard but tasty and some jasmine tea to go along with it my favorites were the dumplings and the buns although i have no idea what they were filled with we just ordered based on the pictures on the menu which was really helpful the spicy items are really spice so be careful when ordering no frills cheap fast food,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,i had a mouthgasm from eating here everything was so good tips bring cash cause they do not accept credit cards also they are closed on tuesday,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,one of my favorite late night eats when i am in singapore expect a long wait although they have expanded to encompass three different rooms now one of my favorites is their unique mee sua kueh which is a pan fried mee sua noodle that looks like carrot turnip cake i like to drizzle the spicy wanton sauce on it before eating yum service is not the best but then again you come for the good food and not  star service treatment,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,beancurd roll   starsbit too salty pretty sure there is prawn or meat inside fried pumpkin with custard  starsit is  inside not sure how i feel about it but the texture was great passion fruit juice    stars,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,this is my favorite supper haunt every time i come here i end up ordering about half of the stuff on the menu i know there are better quality dim sum out there but none can beat the variety do not be intimidated by the line yes there is always a discouraging queue of people waiting on the roadside but it is also moves fast since they have sooo many tables a few of my favorites are liu sha bao salted egg yolk bao steamed pork ribs chee chong fun with prawn charsiew mee suah kueh beancurd chicken roll shredded dried beancurd parsleyyou can ask for chili oil and they will give it to you generously,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,the dim sum i had from here during my summer in sg has made me unable to enjoy any other dim sum since my friends and i came every chance we could and it especially hit the spot after clubbing since it is known for being open till am over a year later we still reminisce about the salted egg yolk custard buns which are h e a v e n i also highly recommend the rice rolls w char siew pig trotters and of course the xiao long bao but everything else tasted good too except i would skip the egg tarts and go to tai cheong for those swee choon is will forever have a piece of my heart try at your own risk you may never be able to eat average dim sum again,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,honestly we were so excited to get some dim sum at singapore and the place seemed to have pretty good reviews but it really was not anything special we ordered a whole bunch of stuff and nothing really stood out for going to a lot of dim sum places this place was subpar at best they also do this thing in a lot of singapore restaurants where they charge you for hand towels and tap water they put the towel on our table for use but then we realized after that you get charged and they do not really specify that,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,if you want classic dim sum dishes or chinese main dishes swee choon is a must try extremely well known for the dim sum swee choon has all your favourite dim sum dishes but have elevated the food to be more refined and more delicious a definite must try is their salty egg yolk bun the bun is so light and fluffy while the egg yolk is so creamy and oozes out of the bun the egg yolk also is so flavourful and compliments the soft bun so well another must try is the fried taro dumplings filled with delicious meat these taro dumplings are fried to perfection and are much larger than what you normally find in other restaurants they also serve fried turnip cake and fried red bean crepes if you want a dish with more substance or bigger portions they also have rice and noodles dishes highly recommend their ho fun which is a rice noodle dish with an egg sauce the ho fun is so flavourful and also comes with veggies and seafood this place is a must try for both dim sum and normal chinese dishes,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,great food and superior prices do not worry about the long line out front they move quickly you use your phone for ordering so the food comes quickly but maybe a little out of sequence we had the crispy fried pork sauted long beans with minced pork and the sichuan chili oil wonton i have to say all the items were the best i have ever had finished the meal off with chilled cocoanut pudding for a great finish,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,i am a big fan of dim sum i have tried a lot in different country the line is really fast there are a lot of place inside with ac about the food siu mai is ok ha kao has two big shrimps inside they come by  pieces xiao long bao skin soft but the soup was not there just a little bit prawn chee cheong fun only for dinner for the rest fried dim sum and desert were just ok so i wo not come back for sure there are many better dim sum restaurant in singapore go there only if all the others dim sum are close they open all night,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,this was the last stop of our  part brunch and by the time we arrived we were pretty much eating for sport we ordered a few savory and a few sweet dim sum dishes and tried our best to eat everything the portuguese egg tart was satisfying as was the salted egg yolk custard bun although the sweet items were good the savory ones were just ok i am kind of surprised by the number of great reviews for this place compared to dim sum in hong kong or even in the us this was not that impressive save your precious stomach space for something more special,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,pretty solid dim sum place with a variety of dishes my favorites were the pork ribs the big bao and the mango dessert they have a ton of options so you can satisfy any picky person,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,the dimsum of swee choon can easily stand next to the more upscale versions in town and now they are open for lunch too plus they still serve the late night crowds their custard buns are hands down the best version i had throughout singapore and one of the reasons to come back other things i like include xiao long bao egg tarts har kau the no nonsense efficient style of the restaurant makes me forgiving for the lack of contact between the servers and the customers and unlike at other chinese restaurants in town i have never been given even as much as an eye twitch that i do not speak chinese love it,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,portuguese egg tart not too sweet flaky layers of crust one of the best bao with creamy inside very nice while hot xiao long bao soup is nice juicy meat on the inside sticky rice with chicken carrot cake crispy edges late night eats just say yes,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,my go to spot for dim sum in singapore you can find most of your typical dim sum dishes siew mai har gao rice rolls bbq pork buns etc plus more such as soup dumplings you have to also try the green onion pancake as well as the chili wontons a filling meal for two ran us about  sgd which is a steal only reason why i gave swee choon  stars is because the auntie at the the counter was annoyed when i told her i did not eat the appetizers they put on the table which we knew they were going to charge us for if you are not going to eat the appetizers be sure to tell the waitress to take it away or else they will charge you for it aside from this i think swee choon is great for the money if you are looking for dim sum in singapore,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,pros overnight hourscheapfastcons food is not deliciousthis location is a place frequented by after party drunkards may get noisy food is very cheap but only mediocre,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,great food great service good for expatsthe picture menu helped you need cash or a card that is used in singapore to pay luckily there is a atm across the street we had fun and will go back when in town again,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,great place for dim sum in singapore their shrimp dumplings are still the best i have ever had thin skin with a bunch of shrimp inside get the deep fried banana and shrimp dumpling sound weird but actually very nice,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,hour dim sum place plenty of seating fast service good variety of dim sum dishes offered would recommend if you are in this area and want a quick bite,Positive

swee-choon-tim-sum,great soup dumplings and noodles the only negative thing about the place is a long wait but we did the take away food was still amazing,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,good menu with lots of options has enough for you to find something you like that keeps you coming back like yours truly or to keep you coming back to try new things the service plays it fast and loose and everything from seating to ordering serving to payment moves quite quickly no worries if you cannot speak a lick of anything other than english as writing on order forms pointing and gestures usually end with the desired result the dim sum is quite good and most of the items are enjoyable it is an evening and all night place that is closed on tuesdays learned that the hard way,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,i felt this place was like a   but i decided to push it to a  for a few reasons  late night dim sum there are not a lot of choices  good organised queuing system we came around pm on sunday and we actually got seats immediately despite the queue coz we were only  and ok to sit in the alley at the back  pleasant service from the  or  different guys who served us what i ate  fried garlic dou miao for  dollars worth it  char siew bao love the filling but the bao skin was a bit too chewy actually all their bao fillings were good we had also the lotus bao the custard bao nice molten without being too liquidy ie my friend who likes custardy type and i who like molten were both quite happy  cheong fan no filling but we had a craving having missed it recently at pek kio when it was closed for cny and wow nice surprise so soft and smooth looks simple but all comfort in the mouth this was one of our favourite items  xiao long bao came quickly and was surprisingly good the skin was quite thin lots of juices a bit lighter and finer tasting rather than lipsmacking greasy but very tasty  egg tart yum smooth light texture for the filling quite sweet though good sized tip do not order lemon tea unless you want the canned seasons one i was hoping for homemade a few other comments i have not been here in many many years there is lots of choices on the menu and also cooked dishes for variety streetside parking around but need to be patient old school tea served in a teapot with a cup that you can sterilize in the saucer of hot water my expat friend who has lived in singapore many years was not sure what to do with the hot water so i had to explain haha nice touch,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,amazing great quality dim sum love the salted egg buns dan dan noodles and most of the items in the menu open all night worth waiting in line it is been there forever and is pretty cheap highly recommend it,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,there are a really no words to describe the eating here best best dim sum ever jesus it is good hole in the wall place lined up wait you will not regret waiting for this unbelievable eating experience it is fast pace loud and very organized the turn over is huge but not rushed i went twice when i was in singapore do not let this pass you by,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,maybe it isnt the best dim sum in singapore but i only had once chance to eat and it was crack it stays open late night and has the bomb dim sum full of locals eating we ordered like  things for  bucks the soup dumpings xiao long bao hot and sour soup were amazing,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,a friend brought us here go for it if you want some dimsum i think it is good for late night suppers,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,pretty much the go to place for late night dim sum never fail to get the fried mee sua kueh and the custard buns when i am here quick service decent prices air con seating mostly gets really crowded on weekend nights though,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,i came here a while ago so i know this definitely needs a revisit and a review but all i can say is from past experience i highly recommend this place because it just was not what i expected i love how its open late at night i love the casual ambience and the food was delicious i came in with around  people and were accommodated very nicely we played games we ate good food what more is there to love also the most crucial point up to that very moment in time i was convinced that red bean was not for me after tucking into their red bean pancakes and tuck in i did i literally made a  degree turn and now cannot get enough of red bean desserts they are so so delicious we had to order more i would go back just for that in fact i am planning to make a massive trip with my sister and cousins the next time i am over looking forward to it already,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,known for its late night dim sum quite a fan our group was seated immediately as we were willing to rough it outside with their alleyway seating instead of waiting for a table inside which is air conditioned it was not too unbearable outside a tad bit warm but definitely worth saving   minutes of time waiting service was fine they had a button on the table you can press and a waiter will come over pretty much instantly very efficient this way the food was very good one of the better dim sum places i have had i think this would be the first time i have had dim sum in the evening you wo not be disappointed,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,i would not call this a dimsum place per se but a place that serves dimsum items and some chinese food favorites custard bunchicken feetshanghai wonton soup prawn and banana fritter the rest of the items are palatable acceptable and order whatever you want i have had a few late nights here with a girlfriend and we have never gone over  for two people have i mentioned the best part is that it opens till dawn,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,reasonably priced dim sum able to accommodate alot of people can get noisy it is ok when you are seated indoors but outdoors at the back can be really gross due to the drains and lack of shelter,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,this was my first visit to this place and as a tourist to this country i think swee choon tim sums are the best their menu is so different and the food comes to your table piping hot it is fresh and so authentic that if i were to live in singapore i would visit this place every fortnight i was very luck to have been taken to this place by two locals and they showed me exactly how to eat each dish as you all know dim sums are better enjoyed in a bigger group so one can try more varieties however if you are visiting singapore and are clueless about which place to eat dim sums at look no further at peak hrs this place does get crowded and wait times can go upto about an hour or so,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,do not expect refined food and you would be enjoying yourself the food is generally decent and what i think swee choon has going for her is  cheap affordable pricing decent variety efficient dining experience supper spot no  is probably why most people are here although there are some good competition around the area da lian noodles across the street and tim ho wan at lavender and both opens  hours swee choon definitely has their own following my favorite is also the fried mee suah which most yelpers has pointed out i have never seen this dish anywhere else savory rice noodles pan fried it is certainly interesting everything else on the menu you can probably find a better version elsewhere,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,my go to place for dim sum at am order the fried mee sua cake carrot cake made out of mee sua the peitan porridge xiao long bao siew mai har gow even the sauteed veggies i think u cant go wrong with most of its dim sum items except for the chee cheong fun that made me sadhavent tried the handmade noodles yet thats next on my list it can get very busy on the weekends with long queues snaking outside but there is a takeout window which moves pretty fast,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,cheap and cheerful dim sum with character think din tai fung crossed with a nice hawker centre their xiao long bao soupy dumplings are fantastic and a must try and the wanton dumplings with the chilli oil is also a favourite only downside is there are no alcoholic drinks on the menu,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,the best place for dim sum and other chinese food absolutely delicious and its definitely worth the money do not know where to go for supper i would definitely recommend this restaurant which is conveniently located along bendemeer road very suitable for dinner gathering with large group only problem is its difficult to find parking and also long queues during meal times and weekends,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,i love swee choon it is affordable and delicious with a no frills get super efficient style that does not waste time on pretensions and just gets you your food my favourites are the carrot cake and the pan fried dumplings i have to get those every time swee choon does get very crowded in the evenings be prepared to take a number and wait it is a smooth system though you get your number texted to your phone and you can keep track of how long your wait is,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,dim sum madnessssssss order the liu da bao order the congee order what other tables are ordering order the horfun if you wanna prove me wrong mine severely lack the nice wok fragrance and needed more seasoning one time i was not feeling too good and had watercress soup it was not too bad,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,quaint little dim sum store near little india me and my friends ordered some dishes like the legendary xiao long bao and the typical siewmai the dishes tasted almost flawless and is honestly one of the best dim sum around singapore the only downside is the price and the seating the prices are quite expensive and the seating is quite limited due to the crowd highly recommend xiao long bao,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,the egg tart and char siew bau are great it is nice to have these tim sum for ending the day you can see many people sitting there and make you feel it is still early in the evening it is not expensive and you can feed your stomach easily try it especially when you stay near to this restaurant,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,the most affordable good variety of dim sum in singapore and best part is that it opens throughout the night and is a very pleasant option when the weather is a bit cooler good service nice prices and some unique stuff as well i liked the udon in onion oil nice flavour and goes well with the clean soup i am a regular wish they had a couple of more branches but not in malls and only in shophouses,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,food served in small portion and pricey taste is just average do not understand what draws people here presentation of food is bad too servers are not friendly and attentive,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,i have gotta say swee choon is a great place for a drunken post party supper especially if you get a seat at the tables in the dark little alleyway behind the restaurant it is so shady it has a specific charm to it i prefer sitting outdoors anyway even though there is airconditioning inside the fluorescent lights are a pet peeve of mine and the floors are oily service is curt and efficient but do not expect a smile they guys working here are so busy they do not have time for niceties they shout out orders and commands into a walkie talkie striding about busily serving and clearing plates and taking orders at the same time i am honestly quite impressed at their chaotic system somehow it works be sure to come early if you are coming for dinner or an early supper it gets pretty full up the dimsum here is affordable and of decent quality it is also served in small portions so couples can come here to eat by themselves too i especially like thei liu sha bao it is bun with some kind of custardy salted egg filling the golden filling oozes out of the steaming bun as you bite into it their char siew buns are also pretty good with a fluffy light bun and tasty meaty fillings another thing i like to order is the char siew pastry the pastry is light and buttery with sesame seeds sprinkled in top super tasty the har gow and siew mais are pretty good as well but the century egg porridge was far too bland and uninspiring the non dim sum dishes are alright as well so do not be too worried about ordering different things to try another dish that deserves special mention is the orni yam paste it comes with pumpkin and gingko nuts and it is divine served hot in an individual bowl it is a generous portion for one person it is fresh and fragrant with a thick and consistent texture i love that it is not too sweet as well love it here will always come back for more dimsum in a dark dingy alley parking here is tedious business only on the street and this ebing little india people are walking around everywhere and you also have road works to contend with good luck,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,this is the place to go to for late night dim sum instead of the usual morning dim sum swee choon opens only at night and serves dim sum besides noodles and dumplings and other dishes the food is pretty much average this is not the place for fine details or quality food it is just a normal place with food which will suit most the highlight for me besides the opening hours is the liu sha bao custard bun which is done pretty well eat it while it is hot and you will get the soft custard filling flowing out of the soft bun another dish which is not commonly found is the mee sua kueh it is similar to fried carrot cake except it is made of mee sua strands of mee sua are fried till crispy it is good though oily you will need to share this as the grease can make it a bit heavy on the stomach the har cheong gai prawn paste fried chicken wings is pretty good too do not bother ordering the bean curd it is pricey at  or more and is very average you are better off having bean curd somewhere else the other dishes we ordered are not that memorable at all,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,definitely overrated dim sum and would not recommend to friends the presentation of the food is bad and the taste is not that good as people mentioned maybe we ordered the wrong food,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,i cannot believe i have never heard of this place till recently a good friend of mine is a fan and has been coming here and raving about their dimsum for ages so it was only natural that we would end up coming here eventually apparently queues are a common sight to behold but we were here at pm on a weekday night and there was none loved their steamed custard buns xiao long bao and chao shou sichuan wontons in chili oil the custard buns came at just the right temperature and were packed with the divine yellow gravy which was viscous and oozed out just barely as we bit into it in comparison to a recent version at another shop where it was so watery and hot that the both of us got scalded they were generous with the meat in the xiao long bao and it was flavorful and i would dare say comparable to the ones at crystal jade would have had more of this if not for the limited stomach space the chao shou came lying in a very tasty chili oil mix and were more spicy than other ones i have tried it was good but could have been better it came in a shallow dish making it quite difficult to scoop up sufficient amounts of the chili oil to go with my wontons would have preferred to ladle some more into my spoon for that additional kick as i was eating it perhaps next time i will ask for some extra oil on the side dessert was mehhhh had the yang zhi gan lu mango pomelo dessert and i have had better dinner came up to be about  for  affordable and good i am definitely going to return someday,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,swee choon is kinda famous for the mee suah kueh  for  which is a deep fried rice cake that is wrapped in a salty rice vermicelli but that has never been my favorite i was not all too impressed with the food the first time i went and i was glad that i returned with my food kakis after a long hiatus since every dish was pretty small that allowed us to order up a storm even at  in the morning oh and this was after i had my peanut butter french toast and hazelnut latte at midnight we had the salted egg yolk custard bun  for   which was not all too bad i liked the sichuan chili oil wanton  for  which had the right amount of spice and vinegar the steamed pork ribs   were also tender and well marinated i rather liked the pan fried carrot cake  pieces for  that had the right chunks of radish and dried shrimps no chee cheong fun for me because it is the regular kind and not the steamed cantonese sort yes i am picky that way you must order the fried golden tofu   that is lightly crusted on the outside and seasoned with pepper and salt the silky texture is simply amazing the steamed beancurd roll in oyster sauce   is also very good i will definitely be heading back if hunger pangs strike in the middle of the night,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,it is swee choon tim sum i dont think i need to introduce it much except the fact that it used to be just one unit non airconditioned and a little raw and dirty which has it is natural draw of a very authentic chinese late night dim sum place though it small and slightly rundown it was usually packed cos the food is good lo and behold a few years down the road swee choon tim sum has expanded across   units with  of them air conditioned despite the expansion it is still packed and please do not expect to get a seat straight away cos you will definitely still need to wait to get a table it is just a matter of how long is that waiting time classic dim sum menu the hargao steamed prawn dumplings and siew mais steam pork dumplings are really not that great but you gotta try their salted yolk custard bun for the uninitiated there is a way of consuming these salted yolk custard buns that will not cause a mess or an unexpected explosion of hot buttery custard all over you to prevent unnecessary embarrassment remember you attack this heavenly bun from the bottom slowly peel off the paper cup base and slowly bite into the bun savour each drop of creamy salted custard before taking another bite the rave seem to all be abt this custard bun and really that is pretty much about it for me i dunno why people flock here all the time cos the parking is terrible not many parking lots around and the food is only average but it still one of the few places that i will always go for late night dim sum craving what a sucker i am,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,swee choon is an ok place for late night supper with friends or family although the dim sum variety here is extensive i feel that taste wise it is not as good as other dim sum supper places like crystal jade at holland village their staff service is pretty bad too one of the waiters got pretty pissed and went away in a huff when we asked for our drinks to be served after  mins of waiting i would say a good place to hangout for dinner supper early breakfast if you are just looking to fill your tummy do not try pumpkin pastry see picture do try fried carrot cake,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,great cheap food with no frills be prepared to wait at busy times it is definitely worth it,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,i love swee choon and find any excuse to go there i especially love the green beans and the chee cheong fun i recommend washing it down with less sugar chrysanthemum tea they are a bit slow with the water so remind them also the picture menu does not match the order sheet exactly which can be frustrating the line gets crazy so do not come when you are in a rush and it is best to come earlier it is great for groups,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,i went here last night and it was amazing i was in a group of  and we ordered a ton of food and i was not disappointed in anything the salted egg yolk custard bun was a new item for me but it was great and the smoked duck with black pepper was my favorite the duck is the stuff of dreams i cannot go into all the food mostly because i do not know everything we ordered but i can say that i am confident you could go to swee choon tim sum order whatever you want and be really happy with your decision,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,some portions might be small for hungry people but everything is super tasty must try har gao century egg porridge xiao long bao,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,i first started going to sweechoon timsum back in  three years has passed and this restaurant is one of my favourite go to places for late night supper and dimsum cravings some of my favourite dishes include  salted egg yolk custard bun i do not think this needs much introduction the bun is small but full of goodness  beancurd skin prawn roll i love how they deep fry the beancurd skin with fresh shrimps and minced meat but this dish is seriously one of their most inconsistent dishes some days it is served cold and soggy i guess one can only hope for the good days  spicy chili wanton nice and soft wantons in a spicy vinegar sauce what is there not to love  mee sua kueh this exclusive sweechoon dish has mostly mixed reviews with some thinking it is too bland but i love the texture and crispiness of the kueh it is like fried carrot cake but better food aside it is good to see that their business has improved tremendously throughout the years but it is depressing that the queues have gotten ridiculously long as a result my most recent trip there last friday saw me waiting in line for more than mins before i got a table while the food may be relatively cheap and good i can no longer justify traveling all the way down to jalan besar and then waiting another h before i can have my food guess i will be on the lookout for other supper alternatives,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,this place has the ambience of a poorly maintained public restroom but my wife and i are regulars here anyway i do not think their dim sum is anything special despite the name but their northern style dumplings and hand made noodles are very good for me the star dish is their spicy chili wontons the dumpling skins are thin and silky they are generously filled with juicy pork and the sauce is a perfect mix of black vinegar soy and chili also there is this one waiter who runs around the place like a madman yelling beep beep to let people know he is coming through even when there is no one in his way,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,best xiao long bao and har gau in s pore and they open very late though the queue is always long the staff are very nice to arrange for us quick serve and good food,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,you cannot always have it all and swee choon definitely does not have decor and good food but as long as you come for the food and not the furnishings you will be fine swee choon is hours  pm  am and menu dim sum and lots of dumpling types of fare are as good at  am as they are at  pm they have typical dim sum dishes like shu mai and those egg yolk custard buns but they are mediocre here and the selection is not extensive e g only plain cheong fun is offered here but they brought in some shanghai trained chefs who turn out hand made noodles and different meat filled pockets of doughy goodness xiao long bao spicy wanton with a deft hand i wish they had a few more meat or vegetable dishes but if i can only order dan dan mian and delicate tender spicy wanton i will still be happy and full,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,recommended by a close chef friend of mine who insisted i should give a try i finally made my way down to swee choon after a night of partying and was left impressed one of the few places to be open past am it is quite common to see long queues and full houses on wednesdays and throughout the weekend in fact its more of a nightspot than other usual tim sum places that open in the morning they close at am the service staff are attentive and quick and food is served within minutes of ordering regardless of the crowd decor is kept relatively simple and tables are well spaced allowing for comfort while eating though it can get a little noisy so far the fried mee suah liu sha bao prawn rolls and chee cheong fun are the dishes that i find myself repeating whenever i am there,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,this is my favorite place to go to for dim sum when i am bored at night i find opportunities to go for a walk at mustafa is along the street was where i found swee choon tim sum brightly lit signboards on the outside huge crowds of patrons queuing outside definite must try my favorite is the golden tofu cubes top with a little pork floss these are to die for their soup dumplings and pan fried dumplings are my bf is favorites if you are a congee lover you wo not want to miss sc is century egg congee yummmm if you hate queuing here is a good hack go behind the restaurant and volunteer to sit at the back alley you get good food fast and sitting in the back alley gives a more casual feel to the dim sum experience opening hours are weird here they open everyday except tues from pm until am fantastic for the owls in you,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,this is a wonderful place to get good quality dim sum at weird hours you can choose to sit indoors which is airconditioned or outdoors if you are a smoker i love their har gao prawn shrimp dumpling comes in pairs as well as their custard buns which comes in thress their chee cheong fun is smooth and thin not the typical machine processed kind which is laden with flour do not forget to try their special fried red bean pancake they also serve mango sago dessert and a plethora of drinks such as barley ice grass jelly and more for a group of four if you eat to your fill it probably will cost about  per pax,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,swee choon dim sumis one of those places my local friends always talk about and recommend though after a few visits i cant see what all the fuss is about that is not putting the place done i just have had better dim sum in other parts of singapore and even in melbourne there is always a queue out the front but walk through the store and sit out the back is your best bet for a table while you go without aircon and any real artificial light it adds to that real se asia dining feel be warned though if you do not like rates or mice i would give the back tables a skip as they will often be running around the gutters and under tables in the dark food is decent while not spectacularly good extensive choices is a plus drunken chicken is fantastic good place to hang out for late night dim sum,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,authentic that is for sure a bit run down a dirty as well which i guess is part of the experience but do not expect a nice dining experience the setting is definitely simple especially in the tables in the back where roaches are never far still it is a nice place for late night chinese cravings as it is open all night long food is good just do not expect it to be din tai fung,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,down for dim sums at swee choon anytime,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,overrated used to be good few years ago but the word got out and it got crowded oily food overpriced who cares if no decor u can get better elsewhere let the uni kids queue for oily food,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,really local place where it is possible to try a peace of local and hong kong food there is always the queue when i come but if u like eat outside u can make the turn and ask a table outside fifth star missing because it is only possible to pay by cash or nets which is not always convenient,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,this stall is actually located near tekka mall and sim lim square about a  minutes walk away facing the macdonald is on the other side of the road it only opens after pm but do be reminded to go early as even if you reach at pm there might be a queue there already i went about pm and it took about  minutes before we could get in to be seated but at least the staff passed us the menu to place orders first so that we could pass the waitresses the order chits when we got in there were some new items on the menu that i never saw before like the fried mee sua which tastes rather interesting but it was really delicious at the same time who would have thought of fried mee sua wrapped around some carrot cake there were other usual dim sum items like the black bean pork ribs char siew buns and siew mai all were pretty good but the price however came up to about  per pax so be prepared for that i will still go back nonetheless for their quality of dim sum,Negative
swee-choon-tim-sum,one of the best timsums in town was surprised when seeing a lot of people inside the restaurant at midnight i surely will be back soon,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,swee choon is the place i go to with my friends if we are really hungry at  am and we are craving cheap and good food the food they serve is okay with dim sum standards like siew mai and chee cheong fun being decent enough to satisfy your cravings and at  am in the morning you will be hard pressed to find another restaurant which serves better dim sum that being said though do not go to swee choon expecting mind blowing michelin star worthy food it is what it is an after hours restaurant serving the needs of night owls,Positive
swee-choon-tim-sum,where would you go if you are so sick since you cannot find dim sum in singapore in the middle of the night to the hospital of dim sum this place is seriously looked like a doctor place bunch of people waiting on the road side sitting on the plastic chair staring at the electronic ticker praying that their numbers to be called next i was surprised that the line was long when finding parking in this area should also be a separate challenge cannot really miss this place on jln besar since the shop almost occupies the entire block go to the podium outside to get a number by telling how many in your party wait while filling in your order in the form by looking at the big ass laminated menu sampler not all the things are shown there hurry back to the podium when your number is shown on the ticker sit on whatever table the bouncer tell you to press the bell on the wall when you are ready to order be warn that nobody gonna ask you about the order unless you do that i sat for  minutes getting confused why nobody came around to ask and enjoy the fast service cheap and good dim sum by cheap i really meant it i pay just above sgd  for  items and  drinks it is been a while to find a dim sum place so popular but so cheap in singapore tried the chicken feet fried shrimp dumpling fried shrimp in tofu skin xiao long bao mixed veggie and siu mai portions are small most items only has  pieces on them but they did not skim on the meat the fried dumpling and tofu skin were pretty packed with shrimp the veggie looked liked blah when i st saw it we ordered it since it is the only veggie item available on the list but it was surprisingly tasty and good,Negative
corner-house,great food and excellent decor definitely should check it out there is not a lot else to write but i have to fill space so here is some words please dont moderate me yelp,Positive
corner-house,came here for the lunch tasting menu since it was a bit cheaper than dinner coming in here they start you off with some bread and nicely whipped butter need less to say that it was amazing the tasting menu consisted of amuse bouche carabinero prawns new zealand blue cod crispy scales wagyu beef cheek japanese chestnut the amuse bouche that was served to us was a leech bubble bursting with a delicate cold sweetness and a shrimp cracker with some roe the former is a little bit sweeter but then the latter is more savory so definitely eat in that order we then had these prawns and wow that was amazing the spot prawns were cooked sashimi style and served in this amazing bed of fruits and vegetables it was such a light dish that had so much going on sweetness acidic multiple textures and i loved this dish i found myself finishing all the dressing as well since it was just so perfect and really maximized the freshness of the spot prawns it came with some squid ink rice crackers so really let you get a very delectable bite next come the entrees and imo the absolute star of the show the cod with fried skin they leave the scales on and deep fry that i have never had this in my life but omg if this was not the best cod i have had in my life step one the meat is obviously cooked to perfection not too tough as to be overcooked and not too soft where it is a bit raw just perfect but that is tablestakes the jewel was the skin the scales all popped up and was sprinkled with a generous amount of sea salt and a bite into the skin just felt like you were tasting this fish straight from the ocean with all it is saltiness it was amazing the texture was so crispy and it did not leak to the tender meat below the beef wagyu cheek was probably the best cheek i have had that being said though i am not sure if i love cheek that much the texture of cheek is traditionally chewy and here it was fattier and much more tender than i am used to it almost tasted like other parts of wagyu flank for example but i would have just preferred normal ribeye wagyu i appreciate the quality and skill here and i feel it is like showcasing a more forgotten piece of steak i would just rather have the wagyu ribeye though the dessert left a little to be desired there was some alchohol flavor in the sauce and the dish was good just nothing too special here all in all it was a great meal and came out to be s  after tip and taxes for two i think the price point is pretty spot on and i would come back it is not a bargain by any means but not a rip off either,Positive
corner-house,i tried the chef is choice  meal courses for s   it was very beautiful sophisticated presentation wagyu dishes was over flavored do not really taste wagyu itself flavor black truffle was on the one of the dishes when i bite it i expect to smell the great fragrance of truffle but did not so if you like to eat the dishes respect the natural flavor of the material then probably this restaurant is not the one this restaurant is michelin one star restaurant i would recommend the  meal or  meal courses cheaper and enjoy the pretty building and pretty dishes,Negative
corner-house,michelin restaurant tucked in the singapore botanical gardens such a wonderful surprise and delightful food experience nicely air conditioned but not cold the courses were timed perfectly and each so yummy we never expected to have such a beautiful and tasty meal while exploring a garden we enjoyed every course of the meal,Positive
corner-house,food is so amazing we were a small group and we were all enthusiastic about our dining experience the celebrity chef came out at the end i can only imagine how much effort and passion go into his dishes really a lot of work and attention to all details cannot recommend anything in particular as most was excellent wagu beef lobster desserts nice,Positive
corner-house,a huge splurge for a brilliant meal in the heart of singapore is botanical gardens impeccable service my love of this restaurant is skewed by the incredible amuse bouche and a single petit four the salted egg macaroons my god these might be one of the best things i have ever eaten they melt on your tongue leaving a cacophony of flavour if there is a peak for singapore is salted egg obsession this is it but truth be told the rest of the meal was a mix of the innovative and unexciting the asparagus was quite plain the gariguette strawberry quickly became an unrecognisable mix of fruit flavours the crispy cod though was perfection and use of frozen creme fraiche exciting the venue is beautiful and the service impeccable even if dinner plus three house wines between four cost a hefty  sgd it was an evening to remember,Positive
corner-house,we came to corner house for dinner on our second night in town the restaurant itself is within singapore botanical gardens but even though we came after the gardens had closed and the sun was setting there are clear signs from the taxi dropoff to direct you to corner house without much trouble once there you are escorted up the stairs into the main dining area there are different sections to it given the older colonial nature of the building but the finishes are modern and refined like much of the city state itself one of the standouts for sure alongside the decor is the general ambiance and the plateware in particular it has the feeling of a high end restaurant but comes off as more relaxing thanks to the temperature here no one shows up in the more formal dress i would expect to see at a european or american michelin starred restaurant but the design and thoughtfulness of the food presentation is evident drinks are limited to an extensive selection of wines i stuck with a glass of white and red for the meal itself both of which were quite good as for service i found it a bit more attentive than candlenut from the previous night but in a similar fashion it was not overly personalized either in a similar vein what was listed on our tasting menu was exactly what we got no deviation or extra surprises along the way while there are other menu options if you do not come over the weekend you only have the option of the tasting menu otherwise we were there sunday you get  courses but two of those are the amuse bouche and the petit fours so it is a bit more of a compressed tasting menu than i was expecting to have that said i felt that every dish was very strong as a result it certainly seemed that the chef and their staff were able to focus on making each dish as good as possible the amuse bouche to start off were mostly small bites and served in an interesting fashion our fish skin chips with trout roe were served atop a bed of small pebble my favorite of the amuse bouche round was the last dish presented which was an excellent raw shrimp dish served with cucumbers and a lime infused broth simple and refreshing we moved onto more seafood that was excellently prepared the scallop dish was served cool and with dry ice and combined with the yuzu was fresh and the geoduck clam that came next was served with a generous amount of sliced clam and pasta making it a bit of an italian inspired dish that focused mainly on showcasing the seafood flavors instead of being doused with sauce the white asparagus dish was a nice respite from the rest of the meal the only vegetarian course outside of dessert but a bit more restrained from a flavor perspective the highlight was definitely the blue cod which was served with the scales of the skin crisped mixing the succulence of the fish fillet with the saltiness and crunchy texture of the skin definitely one of the most beautiful looking fish dishes i have eaten and gorgeously presented to boot the wagyu was presented on a mostly empty slate plate but it was quite delicious although it could have been cooked a tad more the middle was too rare for my liking we finished up the meal with a fantastic serving of french strawberries with sorbet as a palate cleanser first dessert followed by a chocolate mousse served with earl grey ice cream and shards of different chocolates probably the heaviest dish of evening but a nice way to end the meal sated corner house is a more western oriented restaurant in the heart of so much delicious southeast asian cuisine but even if you have limited time here it is worth the stop to enjoy a cosmopolitan setting within the wilderness and a delicious meal to boot to me it feels like an appropriate representation of what singapore has become and it is worth making the trek out from the city center about a   minute drive to dine here,Positive
corner-house,i was taken here for a belated birthday lunch on a saturday afternoon the restaurant is situated in the botanic gardens and you may want to look up on how to get there because the garden is quite large i find the food here generally technically competent with flavor pairings quite fresh and a fusion of french and a teensy bit of modsin which i really enjoy the modsin here does not go too far and instead teases the diner here and there i had the amuse bouche prawn cracker and oyster leafnothing to shout about nice and crunchycarabinero prawn with tomatoesi would have loved to eat this with a local prawn but carabinero works too red on red went very well foie gras moussei loved the petal garnish but also well executed nothing extraordinary cod with crispy scalesthis i loved i have not eaten such crispy scales with no hint of oil and such a harmonious balance with the cod and the sauce also very aesthetically pleasing wagyuwell executed with a delicious onion thing my friend does not eat beef so they swapped it out with pork durian bread and butter puddingi felt the durian could have been stronger but overall very tasty and sweet petit fourssalted egg macarons were yum though the salted egg could have been heavier chocs were well good i love this place for their aesthetically pleasing food and its modsin influence i do feel it could be better by being a bit more daring the food here is really technically competent but could utilize more local produce love,Positive
corner-house,short review gourmet hawker center long review food is creative but not exhilarating ambiance is typical and very short of special hype is overwhelming with michelin accolades and table scarcity you can spend pp much more wisely than eating here biggest disappointments include uneven table lighting which led to many dark spots and light spots creating unnecessary contrast no photo pictures because of this lack of intimacy group table in the main dining room was extremely loud and shouting across from each other like it was a drunk wedding which the waitstaff did nothing to help the other annoyed patrons wishing for a quiet dinner overall casual atmosphere t shirt is and crocs allowed i would have felt a lot better about this place if people felt compelled to treat this place like a formal restaurant rather than a hawker center do not bother dressing nicely because you will certainly be overdressed with that in mind this is a restaurant not worthy of a special occasion instead go here to kick off a hen or stag party if you are keen on dropping   per person,Negative
corner-house,great food tasting menu business was perfect for lunch the menu was a little different and not sure that i even knew what some of the items were but trust the chef,Positive
corner-house,truly deserves the michelin star had gone there for their business lunch  course menu i think that is the most value for money way to try out the place its in an excellent location in the botanical gardens their food is a work of art i had the foie grais toothfish and the chef is interpretation of kaya toast everything was spectacular and amazing in taste highly recommended if you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to treat yourself to a great meal,Positive
corner-house,totally a restaurant that caught me off guard one that i saved towards the end of my sg upper tier restaurant binge highly recommended in every regard setting service food and creativity my girlfriend and i made a sunday dinner reservation where quite frankly i was expecting a typical french fusion restaurant that i see all over nyc london etc but there has to be a reason that it is top  in asia even though the list is totally hit or miss we arrived at the drop off location after a short period of getting lost make sure you go to the nassim gate location which is at nassim road and cluny road google maps took us to the other side of the botanic gardens at corner house gate which is the service entrance pretty cool to have a buggy waiting and greeting you by name for the short ride to the restaurant we sat down at a beautiful corner table and were immediately served with champagne followed with the menu we opted for the dinner discovery tasting menu which was a well portioned  course experience see image afterwards we were presented the wine menu which was extremely french heavy and what i thought was a very expensive list we did a nice bottle of hermitage i love restaurants that exceed expectations by a long shot every menu option was just wow not a single course that was not to my liking on top of the level of artistry in each the specific items that blew my mind were the interpretation of my favorite vegetables which was a few different snacks using onion each of which were surprisingly fantastic would you ever think an onion tea would be appetizing it was or onion with truffle or dried onion slices so good also was the chef jason is botanica which was simply an art piece should be in a museum somewhere lastly was his my favorite childhood food memory dessert with meringue crackers homemade pandan kaya and toasted bread which was totally out of this world anytime a top tier fusion restaurant includes local cuisine so prominently in their cooking i get happy service was impeccable the waiters were all very kind and friendly not a single ounce of stuffiness or pretentiousness that you might see at other restaurants of this caliber to add the final touch of perfection jason tan himself greeted us and bid us farewell as we finished our visit easily part of the top  favorite restaurants in all of asia highly recommend if on a date with someone special you are in the singapore botanic gardens after all a beautiful nice family dinner or a group get together,Positive
corner-house,fabulous food one of the best meals i have had in singapore great flavours and combinations service was excellent in total contrast to some other local establishments cough neonpigeon the brevity of this review does not do the place justice just go and make sure you order the melt in your mouth beef,Positive
corner-house,the entire experience at corner house really deserves   stars but because of the amazing food they got bumped up to  we had the discovery menu and highly recommend it the onion prepared four ways remains one of the most memorable dishes we have had to date all waitstaff professional and friendly we met the chef who is such a humble guy a really wonderful restaurant all round we will be sure to be back again and again,Positive
corner-house,i am so fond of this restaurant and it is got so much to do with the exceptional service they offered during our anniversary dinner my heel broke as i was getting out of the taxi and i carried my shoes to the entrance of the restaurant and asked if the had some tape or a stapler so i could perform surgery on my shoe the hostess took my shoe and told me to have a seat she fixed it in  minutes so i could climb the stairs to our table she was so sweet and really added to the memory of our first anniversary i am so thankful for her now to what i know most of you care about shoe repair food the menu was rather concise they offered the chefs tasting meal which had multiple choices for  per person or a more limited menu for  per person that included fewer items we started with a wonderful bottle of riesling for  please see my photos for more information on our meal which was absolutely delightful everything was prepared perfectly the textures and flavors blended perfectly and the service was phenomenal this place is great for a special occasion anniversary or birthday it is not very paleo friendly but it is definitely worth the cheat,Positive
corner-house,not to be mistaken for chubby hubby is chef jason tan helming a once historic and now culinary house that has seen the likes of au jardin les amis the team under him though a little unpolished will certainly shine in due course sophia hope i got her name right deserves special mention for her impeccable service the one thing that you should never pass on here has to be the breads the walnut bread classic french baguette and if you are lucky his version of ham chee peng were all brilliant whoever the bakery genius is behind those delicately delicious dough deserves a pay rise immediately but do limit yourself to only one serving of each and save room for the gastronomical journey that awaits after your sinful carbo loading jump start comes a plethora of amuse bouche that is if you are having the discovery menu that will further convince you that you have come to the right house the play on taste colour and texture awakens and heightens your senses in preparation for the courses that follow the highlights from the discovery menu has to be chef jason is botanica a curation of botanicals in a variety of preparations it is like fifty shades of vegetables in different doneness acidity hue and texture you will never look at a vegetarian dish in the same way again after consuming this artistically assembled selection of fibrous produce and just when you thought you have seen it all another humble vegetable a favourite of jason is is presented for you to eat in  ways the oignon doux des cvennes interpreted and transformed into a confit on crispy filo pastry a dehydrated thinly sliced onion a whole baked onion with sous vide egg and truffle and finally as an emulsion with earl grey infused onion tea hey this man knows likes his vegetables and you will too all before led me to the highest crescendo but alas two of three subsequent dishes that i will single out send me crashing rock bottom the cod with crispy scales was overcooked cold and bland the bresse pigeon was by far the worst dish of the night superlatively gamey and way bloodily undercooked the accompanying foie gras was obviously of the duck variety and tasted as such quite unpalatable is this becoming like a roller coaster ride can his desserts save him the answer is a resounding yes especially memorable were the salted egg macaron and the jackfruit mochi jason is definitely creative and these happy endings led me to give corner house a second chance and that second chance came in the form of citibank is  gourmet with swedish guest chef niklas ekstedt redemption time yes the pacing could have been a little better but somewhat understandable as they were running at full house am not sure if chef niklas upped jason is game but no fowl play today hooray this time around jason is free range chicken dish was licked cleaned and a five star upgrade from the inedible bresse pigeon dish that bombed so badly in the mouth his other solo effort was the scallop dish and again it showed that the overcooked cod might have been just a one off letdown having said that consistency is of the essence when it comes to dishing out michelin stars and the fifth from me will be awarded when consistency is achieved,Negative
corner-house,went for a lunch with some friends and the experience was lovely service staff was patient with our table of  food was delicious and plenty to fill us up particularly love the concept of sharing appetizers so we could try a few different dishes,Positive
corner-house,the  storey restaurant sets the mood for exquisite eating which i did not hesitate to replace the word for appropriateness instead fine dining is far too distant from my experience for which the place is less intimidating but harbor a sense of friendliness and a perfect spot for a daytime botanical meal the lunch is a quick meal intended with no fuss selection except for a top up if you want a riso pasta or a kaya toast as dessert a  course is priced at  while you may go for a luncheon discovery menu which offers a  course at  when you have a more generous lunch hour we were led to our table swiftly and they were very attentive to our needs we were given amble time to decide on our choices and we were brief on the idea behind the dishes and the assembles on our plate each time we were served that is the whole service i give honor to as i care extensively about what i eat and how they flavored my dining exposure they came around with a bread basket piling with fresh baguette and wholegrain slices for you to pick out i was look forward to the small heap of yves bordier french butter very rich and creamy like we did sprinkle a few sea salt flakes on your buttered bread and bon apptit we were presented with the marinated norwegian salmon trout for a start i am not a big fan of any cured fish except for certain meat nevertheless the teaser was not a turn off but was quite lovely given a gentle sweet hint in the creme sauce underneath the bed of salad pyramid with onions celery strips while the petit flying fish roe went popping in my mouth the salmon is nice without a fishy note very nicely cured i had the free range chicken instead of the riso pasta supplement of  the latter reminds me of orzo pasta which i once had at the waterfall cafe and am still liking it i did not want too much carbs so the chicken dish appeals to me the free range chicken has a very fine texture baby tender like a juvenile the skin is lightly pan seared although its thick fatty tissue is somewhat freaking me out jason uses a mix of white and yellow corn kernels for the key flavor which heightens the taste a notch further with natural sweetness the foam like i guess was supposedly the poultry emulsion patterning the plate i tasted the impressive the interpretation of kaya toast supplement of  and was feeling complete the taste of gula melaka has made a strong statement in the dessert while the pandan scent has went into hidding i love the intensity of the coconut palm sugar mirroring the chendol we once knew the muscovaldo sand bits adds bites to the cream along with the citrus element in the yuzu sorbet heavenly match alternatively you may choose to go with the soursoup sorbet which is no inferior than the kaya toast it has a smooth texture with a robust soursoup accent that arrived with a sweet indication not overly nectarous when accompanied by a bed of morello cherry compote the pretty looking meringue extends a light crunch to the frictionless construction it gives you a soft and dainty closure to your afternoon meal however if you adore a loud booming ending go for the kaya toast which conferred a long lasting impression as it did on me oh they have free buggy service ring them up and check on the pick up within the botanic garden bon appetit yelpers,Positive
corner-house,super nice environment in the middle of the magnificent singapore botanical garden very excellent food courteous professional service the day we were there even the suitcase chef owner was there and was very pleasant,Positive
corner-house,this was me and justin b is fancy dinner while on our trip to singapore and it did not disappoint first off the location is awesome within the botanical gardens so its really pretty and tranquil but note that i do not recommend taking the lrt to get here because once you exit the station its a long walk to the restaurant through the gardens and in the singapore heat humidity its not that fun haha after walking to work up an appetite for dinner haha the restaurant itself is so cute its just like a house with cool modern ish decor making reservations online was easy and no problem in getting availability about  weeks in advance we were seated on the nd floor window table which overlooked the gardens for a nice atmosphere service throughout the meal was outstanding too as justin b noticed you know that you are in a nice restaurant when its the kind of place that folds your napkin for you when you get up to use the restroom haha everyone was so attentive to our needs and each dish was explained to us in detail that we definitely felt taken care of i mean after our meal we decided to taxi instead of walk back to the lrt so they called a cab for us and drove us in a golf cart down to the gate so that we didnt have to walk more as for the meal itself we both opted to go all out and ordered the discovery menu and the wine pairings to go with it haha every dish was a visual masterpiece the presentation was so beautiful and some dishes like the vegetable garden which had some like  ingredients in it was almost too pretty to eat haha the taste of the food was actually really good too though haha while every dish didnt wow me they were all good and tasty the pork jowl beef and cocoa pebble dessert were my faves though and they send you home with a tin of madeline cookies that were really good the wine pairing turned out really well for us too very generous pours and it was practically a diff wine with each dish so i felt that was worthwhile to do just the overall price point about  usd per person and i wasnt overwhelmingly impressed with each dish holds me back from the full  star rating but if you want a nice fancy dinner in singapore i would still recommend corner house,Positive
corner-house,possibly the best meal i have ever had we did the lunch discovery menu for  person the artistry that went into each dish was superb being a more average joe when it comes to cuisine i was timid about coming to a restaurant like this expecting it to be outside my realm of appreciation i was pleasantly surprised that even though each dish looked like it was created simply for appearance it was backed up by some of the best tasting food i have ever had and each item being very different from the last my favorite has to be the pork and even as not a big seafood eater the seafood dishes were amazing to cap it off the service is impeccable and the ambiance of the botanical gardens in an old black and white was sublime with a bottle of wine we broke the  mark between the two of us so not something for an average day out but a wonderful place for a special occasion,Positive
corner-house,reminded me of per se in nyc for the oyster omelette narisawa l effervescence in tokyo for the nitrogen dessert signature onion dish respectively fused with a unique singapore style great wine list highly recommend the discovery menu for an interesting gastronomical adventure,Positive
corner-house,the corner house restaurant is a converted bungalow in the botanical gardens as such its location is quaint and very beautiful service is attentive and very professional the food is excellent each course was sublime carefully prepared and presented as a piece of art as expected its pricy perfect for that special occasion very romantic a great place for couples to pop the question the chicken was one of their signature dishes deceptively simple but the breast was brined and sous verde the cooking and preparation method ensured that it was tender and succulent with the brine intensifying the flavor the dark meat was brined and pan fried  methods very different and went well in contrast,Positive
corner-house,i want to come back in this place kyla pangcoga,Negative
corner-house,it was a little difficult to find the spot but once you are seated in the balcony area surrounded with all the green trees you will know the walk is worth and the food is surprisingly good we had the lunch set must pay a little extra for the chocolate tart it is rich and smooth and a little hidden crunchy inside,Positive
corner-house,i was a big fan of au jardin les amis that used to occupy the same premises so i really wanted to check out the new restauranteur came for lunch with  friends we all ordered the four course lunch menu  per person which came with a choice of  appetizers food proved excellent good variety of flavors and combination of tastes and met my expectations based on my experience with au jardin the style is listed as modern european on this website but the waiter pointed out local influences so it was more like contemporary fusion the pork jowl was exceptional the only thing that might do with improvement was what seemed to me the overuse of mousse type sauces and creams as for service a couple of the wait staff were excellent but a couple of others looked grumpy one made eye contact with me several times and just stared with no hint of a smile i also had to ask for my water glass to be refilled midway through the meal no one asked if we would like coffee tea afterwards unfortunate that the service overall did not match the outstanding food,Negative
corner-house,my foodie friend from singapore recommended this restaurant for lunch since we were going to the botanical gardens the restaurant overlooks the gardens i checked the reviews which were amazing we were very pleased with the meal both of us had the tempura soft shelled crab which was beautifully cooked and presented the cod was perfectly cooked extremely fresh and moist my braised beef cheek was so tender it was almost unnecessary to have a knife and was delicious desserts were both excellent one of the best lunches we have ever had portions are not large but adequate reviews are correct about the price three course for s  but my wife upgraded the entree to atlantic cod for  and dessert to kaya toast for  i upgraded to braised beef cheeks for  and vacherin goma black and white sesame ice cream for  but still worth the price due to extremely good food and service we met chef tan who came to see how we liked the meal he took pictures with us and even showed us his kitchen since i said i am a foodie memorable experience overall,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,thanks yelp you helped me find my favorite hainanese chicken rice place in the world so far got a quarter chicken and rice set for   which confuses me since that is actually quite expensive and i hear people say   in other reviews did it go up or did i do something wrong price aside my first bite of the rice which looked like plain white rice btw was chickeny rice heaven chicken was perfectly juicy soup was good and i am sold i almost always have trouble finishing the rice at other places but i gobbled every last bit of the meal tried tian tian and ah tai and still rate this highest in terms of overall taste in a set obviously at  it is twice as expensive tian tians chicken was just as juicy but the sauce and the rice was not comparable to here,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,delish inexpensive and good fast food  for a good hainesese chicken rice i would recommend anyone who wants to get into the world of hcr by trying some of the locals here everyone has their own tastes but this version is lighter compared to others in the market oh and be warned the spicy chili sauce is super spicy but complements well with the ginger sauce and chicken oh so yum,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,simply delicious and fast servicechicken and rice are full of flavor   sgd rice is essential to go with the chicken as hungry as i was quarter to half chicken would satsfiy me,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,ate here twice on our trip a hidden gem and super cheap something about that rice mixture with the sauce and chicken yummy and simple it is not as heavy and is has more of a balanced profile food comes out stupidly quick as well,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,when you are in singapore you gotta have their hainanese chicken dropped by this place after a recommendation and it definitely held up to its name we ordered both types of chicken regular and barbecue the chicken was very tender and it was placed over fragrant rice with a delicious bowl of chicken soup on the side its a great place for a cheap yet delicious meal on the go,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,my favorite chicken rice to go place it is been there for like ever and they have a constant flow of customers just make sure if you want roasted chicken you come before pm or it would be sold out,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,i ventured out on my own yesterday and was out and about i was in the area for laduree and was hungry after about  hours of if i was ready to feast i searched my bookmarks and walked about  minutes to get to here the reviews and good ratings were justified the place was packed i actually had to wait to be seated like w all the food stalls service and ambiance is non existent i would question cleanliness as well however as i watched the patrons devour their food i was excited and very eager to finally have lunch the lady asked if i wanted roast chicken or steamed chicken steamed of course my order came out in like  minutes and for the st time my bottle of water was actually cold the rice was fluffy the chicken was super tender and the broth was flavorful the dipping sauce had a kick to it literally after all of the meals we have had expensive street casual american whatever this was my favorite meal it is no wonder the folks here are not overweight the portions are super small to what i am used to fear not though because i had about  macarons right after my lunch,Negative
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,this place has been around forever and correspondingly i have not been back in years now that i am working in the area i had to give them another try the lunch lines can be long but things move quickly and you should not need to wait ages for a seat just be prepared to share a table with another group if the restaurant gets crowded now for the food i ordered the steamed or white chicken thigh which is served with fragrant rice and a bowl of soup i also ordered a side of vegetables what surprised me was that the chicken here was great jelly like skin always a good sign super tender meat and very flavorful sauce the rice paled in comparison it was oily but did not have much of the fragrance you would expect the vegetables were alright a little on the salty side but nothing to write home about i would come back to have that chicken again and maybe try the roast chicken lastly it is a mom and pop shop so cash is king that would be the case for almost every small eatery in singapore but just thought i would point it out for the many tourists who visit the area it is kinda expensive for what you get but it is also in the orchard road area so i should adjust my expectations,Negative
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,my all time favourite hainanese white chicken rice love thier salted veg duck soup avoid lunch time also fully booked,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,not a bad place to check out in singapore my husband wanted to check out the chicken and rice scene in this country while we were honeymoon ing we got the roasted and steamed chicken which were alright in my opinion could not really taste the difference but my husband preferred the roasted chicken however the broth soup you dip the chicken into it was phenomenal definitely my favorite during our visit here next up duck soup my husband heard that this was good so gave it a go i had it almost immediately when it we got it and almost burned of my tongue the flavor itself was alright it was tomato y and tart which i am not huge on yet it was warm and comforting to drink the soup the duck wad alright overall the experience was good and a great catch pricewise would consider coming back if we are in the area again,Negative
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,i was expecting a lot from this place especially after looking at the reviews over here sadly i was disappointed for the price of  i paid the value of the meal i had chicken rice with a plate of liver failed to hit my mark why the quality of the chicken is just so so and the small portion did not help much the liver did not taste nice and my friend agreed with me other than that everything else was normal nothing special about it while sitting near the counter i saw many articles raving about this place but after finishing my meal i wonder to myself you have to be kidding right but i wo not ruled this place out for my future chicken rice meals perhaps will drop by again to give it another try best is not to come during meal times as it is often crowded and the queue can be quite long fortunately i came at the right time  plus there were a few vacant tables and service was fast not the friendliest staff but got my meals pretty quickly however for the price i paid i am disappointed,Negative
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,it took me a while to find this place via google map it is in the mall and on th is floor otherwise you may find similar restaurant but for thailand food toasted chicken are only available in the morning and i missed it white chicken tastes delicious fresh rice seems saulted nice but not enough for me soup just so so only cash supported alipay or other payment method not supported as chinese i say it worth trying eco dinner,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,i do not see what is they hype over this chicken rice store the chicken is hard and not juicy the rice is dry and feels like eating a normal plate of white rice the price is also more expensive than normal chicken rice to make the whole experience worst the uncle taking our orders is very rude and arrogant overall the whole experience is sub par and not worth the money and your calories intake at all you can definitely find better eateries in orchard area,Negative
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,it is quick and conveniently located in orchard st mall traditional chicken and rice no frills but it was my only option to try that dish in my short trip traditionally it is just in some ginger broth no skin many places had variations but i am not well versed enough,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,when asking for the menu the lady responds with a condescending we do not have a menu just chicken rice well ok there is menu on window with some other items so just a fyi food is good but i have found they are mostly the same everywhere the best being the five star hainanese but it is just too far edit bumped up after revisiting,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,yay yelp singapore i have been waiting patiently for you for the last six years i came here twice on my last visit to the island nation thanks to a rec from a foodie singaporean who claimed this place had the best chicken rice in the land well after two visits i think he might be right or at very least it has to be near the top of the list hainanese delicacy is at the very top of far east plaza hidden amongst a random assortment of hair salons and older food outlets and far away from the trendy shops downstairs this place is old school cramped quarters tables shared with others and dirt cheap prices very crowded at lunch as it seems popular with those who work nearby the chicken itself was melt in your mouth delicious the rice full of oily flavor all incredibly delicious when topped with thick soy sauce and chili free bowl of broth on the side we ordered a side of pea sprouts and these were great too you have the option of getting steamed or roasted but steamed is traditional so that is what we went with so good i could have easily eaten there many more times and i will again on my next trip back,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,at  floor at far east orchard rdthere are  tables and long q you should go before  am or after  pm if you do not want to wait the steam chicken so yummy the duck soup is nice recommend,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,excellent chicken rice located in a shopping area patronized by locals diners are also locals no fancy tableware but very clean had white boiled and roasted brown with slight hint of herb chicken very good and simple soup,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,ate here the previous night after watching star wars the force awakens aww yea with  male friends the  of us ordered a full white chicken  and a plate of vegetables i am not sure about the individual cost of each plate of rice and the vegetables but it was  in total seems relatively pricey but for a shop in expensive town area the value is decent and yes we were all pretty full after our meal so you can judge the proportions for your next meal the meat is soft and tender and generally deboned although there were some portions with bones but they were not a huge hassle to eat rice is fragrant and soup is not entirely plain there is the taste of chicken bones and other ingredients not a bad place though but for the price i rather go somewhere else yes i am stingy nonetheless if you find yourself in town and would like a relatively more budget meal without cutting down on quality this is a good place,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,i would not call this place the best chicken rice but it is definitely one of the most nostalgic one cause it has been around since long long time ago a nice place to go for comfort food tender chicken on top of fragrant rice that goes perfectly well with their home made ginger and chilli sauces their salted vegetable duck soup is my favourite never fails to warm your tummy and tickles your taste bud,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,chicken rice   great price and good portion during lunch time pretty busy prepare to wait leh,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,fast delicious and simple i have tried quite a few restaurants and this one has the best chicken rice in singapore do not be daunted by the long lines the place has high throughput and it is worth the wait,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,great chicken rice some of the best we have had since being in sg the owners were very helpful we got a half chicken breast meat only for  people with rice and it was s  chicken was juicy and good as was the rice definitely use the sauces the chili is spicy thought,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,wow i am surprised that this place actually has  reviews already the chicken rice stall on the th floor of far east plaza is a hidden gem highly popular among locals and people who work around the area the stall is always full even during non peak lunchtime hours it is slightly more expensive too since it is in town but well worth it i love their roast chicken best which is super tender and the rice is fragrant but not too oily loveeeeeee,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,i have been coming here with friends since i was  and i know they have been around waaaay before i started frequenting this place this is usually the st place i visit after i land in s pore partly because it is so central and easy to meet up with friends but also because the chicken rice here is unpretentious simple and sooooo tasty i always get the roasted chicken drumstick things with an extra side of chicken rice soup veggiesabsolutely delicious,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,great experience awesome food just melts in your mouth broth is out of this world would recommend for sure this is a local spot so do not expect the service just enjoy the food,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,a good place to get your craving for hainanese chicken rice the place is packed during lunch so be prepared to be seated beside or around strangers hello stranger nice chicken rice eh we ordered the steamed chicken rice and it was a quick and helpful service we got our fills of tender tasty chicken with great condiments of the garlic ginger paste that is a must to add more kick to the flavor if you are around orchard then this place can be an option for your to go to,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,when i decided to write this review i realised with a start that i have been patronising this stall since i was  it was one of the places my friends and i would end up having our meals after school before proceeding to while away our youth in the shopping complexes in town doing nothing in particular this is probably not going to be the tastiest chicken rice but that is exactly what i like about it the chicken is always tender and doused with a good scoopful of light broth and the rice is always fragrant you wo not get that guilty feeling you often do after a plate of chicken rice elsewhere the chilli also hits the right spot with a good level of spiciness and taste also do not forget to give the duck soup with salted vegetables a go i will probably come by at off peak hours because it tends to get crowded but it also is an experience in itself to drop by at the stall is busiest period you will probably find yourself huddled around the same table as a couple of strangers gobbling down your meal there is definitely a certain charm to that,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,follow yelpers recommendations to visit this restaurant located on the top floor of a low end shopping centre the restaurant is surrounded by hair salons some of which have suspiciously dim lights there is no menu so you just need to make a choice between boiled chicken or roasted chicken and there are some small side dishes but there is nothing for a big bite ordered the boiled chicken with rice but had difficulties in picking the sauces to go with chicken so just watched the locals rice was quite tasty cooked with chicken soup but chicken was a bit plain apparently the place earns a reputation because locals just keep coming,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,chicken and rice is what they are obviously famous for the place gets really packed if you want the chicken soup you have sit there in order to eat it the only challenge is getting to this mall it depends on where you are staying i happen to be staying at the hotel across the street,Negative
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,this chicken rice stall has been here for many years and oozes off nostalgia for many is student days for me i only started eating here for the past year i find the rice surprisingly good coupled with the chili and dark soy sauce the rice is also non oily which is the kind of chicken rice i like we ordered a half chicken with both white and roasted chicken encourage no one to do this they did this on one single plate and the sauce for white chicken kinda ruined the roasted chicken best to order separately white chicken is soft and absorbs the sauce well however it is not as soft and slippery smooth as ah tai is the chicken itself is comparable to tian tian but tian tian is rice is still the best probably due to location it is crowded during peak hours and it is slightly more pricey certainly not the best to me but a decent chicken rice place you can recommend to your friends,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,greetings from san diego california best chicken rice i have ever had it is been seven years since i last stayed in singapore and i can never forget the chicken rice i have had here i always brought him my family and friends to try this place when they visited me in singapore hidden gem indeed,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,the other decent chicken rice place on top of far east plaza in orchard but i like tian tian and the golden shoe one a tad bit better i do not like the vibe of this mall totally run down and the seating here is awful,Negative
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,by far the best hainanese chicken rice ever here in singapore we heard of this place through searching the internet because h c r was something that was on the to eat list here it is a family run business an elderly woman served us and my were the chicken rice dishes delicious the chicken was so juicy and flavourful unlike some of the dry chicken i have had back home the rice was very aromatic and also delicious could not get enough of it so we ordered another serving prices were reasonable would come again the next time i drop by the sg,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,i have been going to this place for about  years now it has always been at the same location and it is pretty famous all over singapore eveyone keeps talking about the river valley chicken rice i do not know but for me this is kinda like one of the best chicken rice in singapore they are famous for their lunch time queues so that is why i prefer going during dinner what i love the place is always crowded but it is worth the wait the rice is nice and moist the chicken is yummy and very tasty apart from that the soup and vegetables are really yummy that it all just goes so well together i can eat this everyday but for health reasons i have this every other month or so what i do not love their drink options are pretty basic but who goes there for the drinks eh,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,i have been coming to this place since i was  there is always a line during feeding times and they are often sold out by around pm i really like the roast chicken and the soup the portion is not too big but will fill you up just nice and leave you satisfied so that you will come back again for more,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,this place was really terrific glad i walked around to find it the rice and soup were done to perfection i prefer my chicken to be a bit warmer but it was still really great the hot sauce was nice and hot and sweet i broke a sweat and then needed to keep eating more to keep the heat at bay,Positive
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,the chicken rice here is good but it is not really a place for tourists my bro and i came here and we ordered hainan chicken rice we each got our own plate of rice and shared a platter of chicken the chicken here was fattier and had more skin than i like but it was still tasty the server asked us if we wanted to order some soup as well which we did and it came in a tiny steel pot i do not even really recall what was in it but i think it had some veggies and spare ribs tasted like something you would have in a chinese household,Negative
hainanese-delicacy-chicken-rice,excellent chicken rice stop in singapore most importantly the food delivers in terms of quality and taste the chicken and rice are not oily meat pieces large and tender and the rice light and fragrant the side vegetables are also quite good and not greasy the place is generally clean with air conditioning westerners bring your own napkins a la singapore style the long lines dissipate rather quickly so be a little patient and you will be rewarded in no time,Positive
the-auld-alliance,i am sure this is one of the hidden gems in singapore you really have to know about this place if you seriously like whiskey once you will step into this bar located at the rendezvous hotel you might think that you are in whiskey heaven the selection of single malts from all venerable producers going all the way back into s if not before is simply stunning there are probably a thousand of different types of scotch and whiskey on the list many available strictly by the bottle to the delight of the aficionados there are also multiple tasting flights offered giving an opportunity to experience true variety i took smoke around the world flight which included whiskey from islay france ireland and india the bar also offers a private room which where you can enjoy scotch with cigar but this room should be booked in advance if you like whiskey this is a must experience in singapore,Positive
the-auld-alliance,great selection of whiskeys located on the nd floor of rendezvous hotel auld alliance is one of the best whiskey bars in singapore with a huge selection of common and rare whiskeys to try the menu is as thick as a dictionary and unless you are a whiskey aficionado yourself ask for recommendations from the friendly staff i had a tasting fleet of japanese whiskey  santory hibiki harmony yamazaki reserve nikka coffey grain my fav  yoichi nas they were all good and selling for  i think if you want a quiet place to decompress after a long day at work or simply to indulge in your me time give this place a go you can thank me later,Positive
the-auld-alliance,lovely ambiance leather chesterfield couches mood lighting and lots of whisky a few cocktails wine and champagne for the non whisky drinkers too the drinks menu is the size of a novel staff are friendly and helpful refilling water glasses discussing whisky choices etc,Positive
the-auld-alliance,ye canna hand a man a granda spanna if you can translate that you are off to a good start if you can say it  times quick you belong here i have been here on dates and wif mates and it never fails to get a belter mense hoora good pure dead brilliant and the always welcome braw that leather bound tome in front of you that looks like the good book is just that so if you have never had whisky before my advice is to just glen the fiddich out of there with date we went for a whisky flight because we would already been elsewhere and did not want to destroy the wallets totally or not get home from memory you get  tasting glasses they are mls or so and they are reasonably priced with mates we were bein all bum and parsley as whisky wankers do and so it got pricey real quick some clever chaps went the cocktail and they were done for the night the rest of us got mad wae it and the night disappeared from there along with all the pictures i took ken fit like,Positive
the-auld-alliance,this little gem is amazing wish i had found as soon as i arrived tried absinthe for the first time delicious ambiance is dark soothing and comfortable service is impeccable interesting eats next door and downstairs beautiful ladies coming in alone to read a book and enjoy a glass of whiskey tell me this establishment is as safe as it is classy i will not visit singapore without making ample time to visit my new home away from home,Positive
the-auld-alliance,if i could own a bar it would be this bar not for the ambiance but for the simple fact that it had the most whiskey i have seen exposed in a room of all ages genres and origins just a lovely place,Negative
the-auld-alliance,my girlfriends and i visited the auld alliance last friday and all in all it was a great atmosphere to catch up in a relatively quiet bar the decor brings to mind the era of mad men with their rich leather sofas and bottles upon bottles of whiskeys lining the floor to ceiling shelves for whiskey selection the auld alliance gets  stars they have every kind of whiskey you could imagine from all over world try their whiskey tasters if you would like to sample a bit of each they have preselected tasters that are fair in terms of value and quality the reason for the ultimate  star review is simply the operations of this bar and my own personal preference the bar was nearly empty when we first arrived around pm yet the entire couch seating area was reserved that is fair enough but when we left around   pm it was still empty they declined to let us sit in the reserved seats and had us at the bar but i was peeved by the fact that it would seem we would have been just fine out in the regular seating area my second bone to pick is how strict and unyielding they are about the cocktails they have roughly  or so selections to choose from should you want a cocktail i asked if a sazerac could be made a cocktail with deep whiskey roots in the u s they could have made this but again declined i get that they are trying to make a point that this is all about the whiskey and not cocktail but frankly i do not like my bars all that up tight,Negative
the-auld-alliance,probably the best selection of whiskies in singapore but it is really too bad you have to go through a retail podium of the hotel rendezvous with a bizarrely assembled tenant mix it felt like i was going to a lan shop or something anyway i guess it is really  stars for the scotch but  stars for their landlord,Positive
the-auld-alliance,this place is heaven i could spend a whole day here but i would probably be wasted i cannot recommend this place more,Negative
the-auld-alliance,since my wife has started trying single malt whisky is i almost feel guilty about being scottish and not drinking whisky a recent yelp event involved whisky from the auld alliance which impressed us both so inevitably a trip to the auld alliance was on the cards in a non descript nd floor shop in the rendezvous hotel we waited until the whisky hour of pm was upon us and nervously stepped inside we stepped into a different world a world that seemed from the previous century as the place is furnished with old chesterfield couches and shelves loaded with whisky is from around the world we took a seat at the bar and opened what can only be described as the war and peace of menu is spoilt for choice we narrowed down to the tasting selection some start from  for a sample of four whisky is we selected some of the older scotched and settled down for our selection to arrive not only did the glasses arrive but our server brought out the bottles for us to see with instructions on how and in what order to taste she managed to avoid nodding off to my stories of my youth living close to bonded warehouses which were loaded to the roof with expensive whisky and guarded by ferocious geese this is true btw anyway the sample glasses were marvelous and we left an hour later aglow and rambling that we would need to do this again great experience and great service,Positive
the-auld-alliance,if i had a man cave it would look like this old library decor with a fantastic selection of scotch and whiskies i did the scotch tasting flights and they used well polished riedel glasses which added to my enjoyment my total bill was not cheap but but class comes with a price tag this place is a real treat with top notch selection available by the glass highly recommended,Positive
the-auld-alliance,what is there to say that has not been said this place definitely has the greatest selection of whiskies in singapore if not asia and is a strong contender for the world as well the karuisawa selection alone takes   pages in font size  and the stuff cannot be found anywhere even at auction today although the proud display of many  year old spirits check out their facebook page might make it sound like a place for those with deep wallets they also offer very decent cocktails and tasting selections which make it a must visit even for the more normal of us who will never get a chance to sip on the moonshine distilled in  plenty of special bottlings for the mid high range too it can get a little quiet on week nights and the area is not exactly boat quay but that just means you can get a seat and enjoy your whisky in peace a must visit for any whisky enthusiast,Positive
the-auld-alliance,yaaaaaaas remember that part in anchorman when ron burgundy goes i have many leather bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany well the auld alliance is new digs in the rendevous hotel says just that just imagine comfy leather couches dark woodsy tones complemented by a variety of golden hues from all the beautiful whiskies into cigars they have a specially ventilated room that you can rent out for a minimum spend of   i am assuming that is  sgd and you can enjoy the ultimate one true pairing of whisky cigars the menu is a binder with page after page of everything they got if you find yourself overwhelmed or need an introduction to whisky the friendly staff can easily recommend something their tasting portions are pretty good value for money they start at around  and you get to sample  whiskies you can choose from themes such as tastes of scotland american styles and  yo japanese styles to name a few the pour is  ml each about half of what they would give you if you ordered per glass what solidifies their  star rating for me is their customer service right after ordering  tastings my husband had something to attend to and could not stick around deciding to ride the wagon of responsibility instead of drinking  glasses of whisky i took a chance by asking the staff if there was any way i could take the samples home i was expecting stank looks and a resounding no but they surprisingly said it was possible and put  samples in small containers and get this they even put the effort into labeling them i was happy that they were able to come through with my unusual request and in the end my husband was able to enjoy the whiskies in the comfort of our own home for that the auld alliance has my business,Positive
the-auld-alliance,auld alliance is not just one of the best whiskey bars in singapore but in the world their collection of whiskeys is just jaw dropping just see the above pictures no explanation needed despite auld alliance is mystique as this high class upscale establishment it is quite affordable for those on a budget or are allergic to singapore is high priced alcoholic beverages i would advise you order the sgd  set of whiskies the sets which includes three shots worth of four different whiskies vary from around the world ie four whiskies from different parts of the world collection of scottish whiskies ie scotch american whiskies japanese whiskies etc depending on your alcohol tolerance this is just enough to give you a nice buzz i think the best part for non whiskey connoisseurs the menu gives a wonderful description of exactly what you are tasting the bartender is the man the atmosphere is second to none think old world speakeasy honestly i think it is one of the best places to hold a conversation where you can really get a chance to know your significant partner and business partner whatever the case maybe i would give six stars if i could,Positive
the-auld-alliance,thoroughly impressed with this bar not to give too much of its allure have to be there to appreciate away it is extremely well decorated and inviting for the archetypal whiskey scotch drinker a little cold though,Positive
the-auld-alliance,the rave reviews of auld alliance are well deserved and still do not do it justice it is hard to believe auld alliance is not mentioned in every travel magazine and blog for its selection of whisky scotch and other spirits the menu is literally a binder chock full of pages from affordable pours to the unattainable  plus year old scotch while the selection is enough to get you in the door and keep you there for hours depending on your bank account the leather couches and dark wood interior harkens back to the days of gentlemen in formalwear sitting on plush wingback chairs enjoying cigars and brandy while debating social matters of the day this is the modern incarnation of that scene without any of the pretension this is a must if you are in singapore whether you enjoy whisky scotch or a cigar very few places anywhere in the world can match what auld alliance offers,Positive
the-auld-alliance,what a gem stopped in on a sunday evening with a couple of buddies after bookmarking it after reading some of the reviews i am not a whiskey guy but had a blast with the sampler options tried the scottish sampler and the tour of the world it really helped to be there with a scottish guy who talked me through the choices but it was a great place to hang out the huge selection the comfortable leather couches and very attentive staff made it one of my new favourite boys night out places,Positive
the-auld-alliance,it is hard enough to find a quiet place to sip away at an average cocktail let alone enjoy the peaceful conversation at a barely audible volume while sipping on fine aged whisky so it is a wonderful thing to find yourself in the auld alliance the walls are covered in the finest selections of whisky the drinks menu comes in a leather bound volume and high rollers could lounge in a cigar room at the back away from the common crowd which to be frank is nothing like the common crowd you would see anywhere else the dim lights and earthy tones coupled with the soft tunes brings speak easys to mind only with an astoundingly huge selection of fine whisky as well they also serve a sweet selection of absinthe served properly with a sugar cube a dripper it is most definitely a place for quiet decadence and i highly recommend the spot,Positive
the-auld-alliance,one of the classiest places i have been to not in a dressed up kind of way but in the hospitality and knowledgeable conversation kind of way i hear the old location was bigger and better than this current one came in with a few friends i had been looking forward to this place since a friend from high school posted it on facebook it did not disappoint from the dcor of wall to wall bottles of whiskey to leather sofas all around to the hidden cigar room behind the shelves of vintage scotches and whiskeys auld alliance felt like the place for me we had several drinks here i opted for a couple of glasses of absinthe it was presented in a very traditional way sans flame the glass itself was modeled after a french style goblet with a chamber where see pictures the best part of the evening besides the company we kept was the conversation was a french guy about why the scotches were served in a stemmed glass we discussed the science behind why it was this way hand warmth ruins the experience as the scotch and whiskeys lose its flavor among other things turns out this french guy was one of the owners very humble pleasant guy i will make another visit when i return later this year perhaps class it up in the hidden cigar room and really do it well,Negative
the-auld-alliance,wow this really is as good as it gets in terms of selection decor and service auld alliance has the best selection of scotch i have seen on any continent and i could spend an hour easily going through the menu fortunately they have quite a few flights that will make it easier for a first timer and you can also get half drams as well if you are looking to imbibe less or in my case find an excuse to try twice as many where do i start scotland the home of scotch or to japan where some of the best scotch whiskeys are coming from these days i really appreciate the deep selection with old vintages as well as a many bottles from distilleries which have closed e g port ellen karuizawa etc the one thing you wo not find here is a deep selection of american whiskeys such as bourbons and ryes but that is ok you are here to drink scotch whiskey and the atmosphere is fitting low lighting plush leather seats stools and coaches and walls of eye candy uh if scotch is your thing a great place to come with friends or solo any scotch lover or anyone looking to learn more about scotch should definitely come here,Positive
the-auld-alliance,great spot for an after dinner whiskey in singapore unbelievable selection collection available,Positive
the-auld-alliance,put in a couple of shot guns and this would be my man cave this is where spies set up meets and war wary soldiers sit with the thousand yard stare during one of my visit i grew a beard a russian brown bear showed up out of nowhere and we fought during the intense battle there was a sudden realization that we may take each the other is life but we will never conquer each other is soul at this moment the bear let out a roar that made the horny sim kids flee in fear and the ktv girls at parklane check their passports after which the bear acknowledged me and left upon seeing the commotion around the area three policeman shouted riot and fled without their squad cars sobbing   would revisit,Negative
bar-stories,if you are anywhere in downtown singapore take a cab get a grab walk or crawl to bar stories and you can thank me later an absolute must stop for anyone who wants an educational experience while sampling some of the best drinks around first they are no bartenders they are mixologists scientists there is no menu rather they start a conversation with you about your likes and dislikes are from there they build you a custom artesian cocktail their assortment of liquors are so eclectic and diverse you may not recognize a single bottle on their shelves my advice be open and honest with your tastes and you will be rewarded the bar is not super obvious to find but yelp is map will get you really close when the map says you are there look up and there is a small bar stories sign look for a glass door and walk upstairs i recommend you sit at the at for the complete experience with the mixologists that way you will get the story on how they are making you cocktail since yelp limits you to  stars for a review that is what i gave them however in reality they deserve,Positive
bar-stories,so this is the most hipster bar in singapore the bar has no sign that i could see it is on the second floor and looks like an apartment i do not mind those things and the drink was not bad but they do not have a menu and the drink i had i finished in  sips now the part that really disappointed me  about a  sing for two drinks that is crazy,Negative
bar-stories,an interesting concept of no menu but a conversation with the customer our drinks were great and the staff were even better if you want a quiet place with interesting patrons and a unique cocktail to enjoy in this historic area of singapore i recommend you check out bar stories,Positive
bar-stories,this place lives forever in my heart so cozy and the bartenders have so much cocktail knowledge they know their shit this place is in my top  cocktails bars in the world they do not have a menu you tell them what you like and somehow they always read you right i have been going over the past  years and they have yet to prove me wrong last week when i went they made a mango sticky rice cocktail for me i love mango and sticky rice but they did not know that i just wanted to write again about them because they are great amazing etc fin,Positive
bar-stories,i have been to this restaurant once the food is delicious especially the dessert thank god,Positive
bar-stories,coolest bar ever speakeasy vibes no menus they customize your drinks according to what flavors you tell them both of our mixologists came up with creative cocktails that were amazing one of them even asked if he could put sake in my drink even though i did not tell him but i was just thinking it he read my mind i could not be happier keep in mind they do take their time making your cocktails but it is all worth it,Negative
bar-stories,i cannot recommend this bar enough my husband and i love quirky and unique bars this has to be on the top of our list the vibe the people and drinks all were memorable we will definitely be regular more if we lived in the city the bartenders were friendly cared for what you wanted and liked and gave something to match our tastebuds one of the best cocktails i have ever had,Positive
bar-stories,second floor location small barreservation acceptedquality craft cocktailscredit card accepteddetailed bartendersno menu takes your order based on your preferencesmall food menu availablein the mist of the indian neighborhood,Negative
bar-stories,great space and bartenders they clearly have the extensive knowledge base to pull off the bespoke drinks brilliantly looks like it may get packed later in the evenings but we snuck in early and there was plenty of room,Positive
bar-stories,stumbled across bar stories on my last night in singapore i was actually looking to take a car across town to some other cocktail joint that i had looked up on the line i think the life lesson here is that sometimes the thing you look for that seems so distant is right in front of you all along bar stories is personal charming and exhibits a passion for cocktails that you really do not see much of any more my first cocktail was presented to me in michelin star fashion detailing not only the flavors and ingredients but the inspiration behind it i enjoyed my visit and this was a great end to my experiences here before i fly back tomorrow morning,Positive
bar-stories,back in the day i would have given bar stories  stars alas times have moved on and they are still a very solid cocktail bar but does not wow me anymore they used to be impossible to get into without a reservation and i am happy to report that when i visited at  on a friday we were seated right away since every cocktail is made to order it is nice how they take the time to listen to your preferences and make something you will enjoy just be quite specific about what you like so they can include all those elements i find that they do very well with their fruit forward cocktails and have a penchant for burning herbs for that smoky flavor i will continue to come back for the good memories and solid drinks but until they wow me it will be pretty hard to call this my favorite cocktail bar,Positive
bar-stories,waiting for the party to arrive we decided that an individualized thirst quencher will help start my dinner yuzu with cucumber bitters elderberry and a couple of other personalized spirits that contributed to a much calmer well being important for a jet lagged body appetizers were different shimeiji fries which we thought were tasty but wished for the cilantro calamansi mayo to have more cilantro and calamansi but still delightful the seabass pate was pleasant curried mussels a big hit we note that their sauces and blended gravies are super tasty wish we had more mantou to schlepp it up with charred golden pomfret had a certain homey singapore momma cooking kind of homey taste to it which tantalized my taste buds and my memories loved it it is a keeper for the menu love the new bar storiesabsolutely love the made for me,Positive
bar-stories,bar stories is a very cool cocktail bar frequented by celebrities and without a menu drinks are made based on your vague desires and the whims of the bartenders this ultra personalisation comes at a hefty price alongside very slow service the poor bartenders were completely rammed on the saturday night and seemed a little stressed out we could not get another order in and given every cocktail order was meant to be a cheerful negotiation having cocktail makers who are overloaded makes the whole experience less pleasant i suspect if you came here on a quiet sun weds night this would be a chill  experience the model just does not quite work delicious though the cocktails are when they are busy,Negative
bar-stories,one of my favourite bars in singapore staff are helpful friendly and provide great recommendations for cocktails,Positive
bar-stories,no menu bars are either a hit or miss bar stories was a fabulous discovery but it was not all smooth sailing came here early on a friday around pm and was surprised that no one else was in the upstairs bar we are americans but it is way past the it is  o clock somewhere people hint usually people do not go drinking until after  pm we noticedi loved their ambiance and setup haji lane is known for being a hipster part of bugis and it is packed with kitschy kooky boutiques and trinket stores as well as poppin and packed chill bars and outdoor happy hours i have visited twice and both times were full of laughing customers beer drinking and dart throwing damn those kids thankfully bar stories is up above on the second floor and away from the loud edm sloppy messes downstairs we were the first customers that late afternoon early evening and loved the wooden steps ac and loungey chairs there was no menu and basically my advice to you yelpers is to be very specific about what kind of drink you like cool you like citrus well what kind grapefruit lemon orange or pink lemonade you like sweet well do you like peach strawberry cherry or grape i was looking for a tequila mezcal drink with a refreshing and smoky hint to it not sweet at all and not too citrus y i mentioned that i love blackberry and anything with berry in it my bartender made me a delicious tequila drink with lemon juice and lots of additional crazy going on with kaffir leaves think thai food and a dried bamboo for aesthetic it was milky like foam texture on the surface but a smooth and refreshing sipper love shoutout to the bartender even though it took literally   minutes it was worth the wait my sister is drink was not as well received i am chuckling as i think back to it but the bartender that day said that he was going to make it with peach and vodka since she wanted a vodka drink that was sweet he also mentioned another fruit that she liked and she though cool rad i love all those things oh boy the final combination was a cherry bomb of kool aid flavor not the business we felt bad asking him to remake it since each drink averaged around   and that is an insane price even when i go out in san francisco i would not dream of paying over  for a beautifully crafted cocktail but singapore has different standards as i came to understand throughout my stay service is pretty much in the creation of your drink they spend a solid  minutes on your drink but there are not cocktail servers walking around since the space itself is pretty tiny in addition to the main space by the bar there was also a back room that holds larger parties but i can definitely see this place crowding up when it gets packed it can be a great spot for a intimate conversation or even a small gathering for a gno but personally i would not squeeze up in here with a large party too much work to get everybody up in the birdhouse,Positive
bar-stories,be sure to stop by this bar on haji lane if you like unique cocktails it is not a fancy bar by any means but the cocktails are there is no menu you just tell the bartender what type of drinks you prefer and what liquor to use and he concocts a delicicous and fun cocktail,Positive
bar-stories,love love love the concept but word on the street and actual reality is a wee bit different so the tour guide who told us about this bar said the concept was based around telling the bartender your life story and he would make a cocktail for you based on your life story reality is that he comes and consults with you on the flavours and tastes you like sweet sour spicy etc and then suggests a cocktail based on your answers you can veto his suggestions if as an example you do not like the fact that gin is involved but hey would you tell michelangelo how to paint all of  of us just had a great evening and there were some great surprises when the drinks finally came out we all tasted each others my fave was this amazing cardamom gin that tasted incredible as will as this non alcoholic cranberry drink that had a chili kick at the end prices were totally dependent on the alcohol involved the cocktails ranged from s   and the mocktails were from s   all i can say is go go go,Positive
bar-stories,i do not drink unless its half a glass of red wine i do not drink unless worst case scenario its a very special occasion and i should be toasting with family and friends i do not drink unless i am at bar stories this is the coolest place ever i have actually added it to the top of everyones lists of places to go when visiting singapore this is where i want to have every first date because its just such an awesome concept you literally can request your hearts desire of a cocktail and have it made for you right in front of your eyes its such a wonderful experience because it allows you to get creative and feel like you have somehow involved yourself in the creation that the extremely talented individuals here have mustered up for you by calling out a theme the only downside would be that the drinks take a while to make but you can watch them do it in awe and to be honest its an excuse for me to drink slower hah also you can see the love and time they put into making the masterpiece which is your drink and watch everyone else is faces light up in receiving their own godly creation the staff there are so friendly daring you on to do your worst as if they are just bursting to come up with something new and when they did make the cocktails most of the time it was something completely innovative that they had just come up with on the spot very impressive the flavours we had last time were something chocolatey served in an actually nutella jar something with pineapple strawberry and white chocolate my favourite flavours and actually the best cocktail of my life fruity with fire and fire there was lychee champagne and peanut butter which turned into peanut butter with a shot of jelly grape liquor which was delicious also a mahoosive pink pocky stick was added to the mix presentation is on point here the following time i had come i was the first to arrive and i got to come around the bar and shake a drink so sorry to the poor guy at the receiving end of that one which was sweet that time i got given this chocolate concoction surrounded by chocolate sauce ice cream and chocolate biscuits have a look at the photo crazy next time i will be back with better flavours i have got something with cheesecake up my sleeve,Positive
bar-stories,there is definitely a craft being performed here so try and think of something you would really like to try or ask the bartender to make something while you tell him your favorite types of ingredients i got a little creative with my choice and had rasberries gin rosemary and something else i cannot remember cris had tequila lemon lemon grass and pepper both of the drinks were amazing i am gonna research my next choices and arrive prepared on the next order also the place is easy to miss it is located on the second floor at haji lane with a small door leading to a stairwell keep your eye out,Positive
bar-stories,no drink menu you just tell them what you are feeling like be open to different variations i ordered a bourbon old fashioned and could not have been happier with the finished product,Negative
bar-stories,let me start by saying if a guy brought me here on a first date i would be more than impressed hidden amongst hookah bars and cool hipster shops on haji lane lies this little gem a cocktail only bar bar stories does not come with a menu nope just creative mixologists who take a few moments to talk to you about your perfect cocktail and then whip it up for you for my first drink i asked for something subtly sweet sour but not overly sweet i ended up getting a concoction that involved berries and a mini ice sculpture for my second i wanted something chocolate y and pretty yet strong i ended up getting the most delicious alcoholic dessert in a cup exactly what i was looking for it involved nutella dark rum and a bunch of other things accompanied by a green tea chocolate wafer biscuit and a nutella spread cracker on the side it hit the spot granted service is a little slow but only because they take a lot of time to make each drink super special my advice come with a girlfriend and sit at the bar and then enjoy a few cocktails at  per drink over a night of catching up or getting to know someone  stars instead of  only because i wish they served alcohol on the rocks on the side too i know it is a cocktail only concept but it makes it kind of hard if you are in a group and one or two people do not drink cocktails mixed drinks at all like most guys do not otherwise love this bar i will definitely be back perhaps next time with a girlfriend or two,Positive
bar-stories,bar stories is clearly on of my favorite bars in singapore they are located on the nd floor of a building on the trendy haji lane in the arab district it is recommended to make reservations to be sure to get a spot here i would also recommend bringing some extra clothes as they have really cranked up the air condition so irrespective of how warm it may be outside it is still chilly inside once seated the friendly staff will discuss a bit what you like and what type of flavors you would like in your cocktail i usually opt for something rum based and fresh and did so here as well they also made sure to ask if there were any allergies or things we disliked and then they go to work it seems they are fairly creative and they use a lot of fresh herbs and fruits i was very happy with my cocktail and so were all the others we were there with together with long play this would be my go to place on haji lane,Positive
bar-stories,as i child i was obsessed with choose your own adventure books it is no wonder that as an adult i am equally obsessed with choose your own adventure cocktails climb upstairs take one of of the bar stools if available undoubtably the best seats in the house and befriend one of the friendly story tellers aka bar tenders do not expect a menu but do expect to be asked if you are in a sweet spicy bitter or herbal mood and expect to be impressed and possibly on fire should that be the adventure you choose,Positive
bar-stories,easily the best experimental cocktail bar in singapore never have i encountered a guy like this bartender zack that just totally nails every drink completely random creations that he turns into an art we made reservations for  for this cool place on haji lane walked up the stairs and sat down in front of this cool lookin dude that looks like a mad genius he asks us our names and what we like he asked what flavors we wanted and we were off there is an array of fresh local fruits and flavors to choose from i remember getting some cool version of the negroni with his twist on it my girlfriend got a lemongrass tea cocktail with tequila not only were the drinks excellent and beyond creative but so was the presentation hers came in a tea pot with a mini tea cup mine was a cool glass that i cannot describe so much detail involved with flavor that you just will not find anywhere else in the world that is the beauty of this place the setting is a bit cramped but otherwise this place deserves all the praise it can get highly recommend for a date or hanging out with friends i will be back,Positive
bar-stories,whether you are a local or just traveling in singapore visiting bar stories is a must there is no menu and instead you get the unique experience of describing the flavors you like and the bartenders will make a custom drink for you everything from the flavors to the presentation is exceptional the two bartenders we met were very friendly and helped us brainstorm drink ideas i asked for something fruity with clear alcohol and spice i was given a lychee and sour plum drink with a chili pepper and it was phenomenal one of the best cocktails i have ever had i also had a raspberry ginger and basil cocktail that was really good my boyfriend had a penicillin a smokey whiskey drink and then had a passion fruit whiskey based cocktail with rhubarb bitters that he thoroughly enjoyed based off my visit we paid about   per drink plus tax and a service charge but it is well worth it considering the high quality of the beverages and how expensive alcohol is in singapore to begin with tldr delicious get there,Positive
bar-stories,bar stories ranks perhaps as my number one cocktail bar in singapore maybe even the world if you would ask my husband he would prefer longplay but i am sure this place would not be long behind bar stories is located on haji lane a street where the western and middle eastern cultures collide there are many bars around with tourists and expats having drinks but also bars that serve no alcohol to respect the arab heritage bar stories is located in the upstair of an old shop house its not a speakeasy per se but it is not something you wonder into without knowing what it is upon entering we were greeted and seated at the end of the bar i love a seat with a view the concept was as in bitters love there is no menu you explain to the bartender what you like and they will make you a drink we went with our usual spirits of choice me wit gin and my date with a dark rum we are perhaps a bit boring but it helps compare also i am really not fond of whiskey cognac or vodka as a base the bartender also asked some questions like do i like lemongrass and could i handle some egg white in my drink yes i could already see from the equipment they had at hand that we were going to see some party tricks i do not mind as long as my drink is good my dates cocktail arrived with a flaming branch or rosemary and mine with a long lemongrass sticking out of the martini glass looking around others had pretty cool looking drinks as well and none of them looked the same the staff seemed to like experimenting and you could see they were having fun with it the taste was wonderful like a mix of a fresh breeze and dessert due to the creaminess of the egg white with spices on top we only had one round of drinks this time but i can imagine i could have sat there sipping on cocktails for a full evening the ambience was charming and relaxed and the cocktails excellent as with many nice bars these days it is possible to reserve a table i remember the days in finland when it cost something and you only got a crappy bottle of absolute vodka and some mixers as compensation there does not seem to be any food or snacks so my recommendation would be to have dinner before going bar stories i love you and i hope we meet again soon,Positive
bar-stories,so no menu bespoke cocktail bars are cropping up all over the city and of course i have to visit them all bar stories looked promising in fact the decor is remiscent of maison ikkoku which is another up and coming bar some would even say it has arrived we asked for drinks with pretty specific flavour profiles and we got something that might have been acceptable if not so watered down it just had no soul pardon my analogy but like a brown girl trying to rap both our drinks it was a bit sad but we persevered on and this time asked a different guy at the bar to make our drinks looks like the trick worked the kaffir lime grapefruit tequila sour that i got was was excellent a salty bitterness to the drink plenty of acid and complexity my husband asked for a penicillin which was all smoke and no fire they did serve it with an interesting garnish though an orange slice with  clove buds set on fire with a brulee torch it added a wonderful nose to the drink but did not make up for its obvious flaws my drink too came with the kaffir lime being bruleed i guess the folks at bar stories share my love for the flame torch if i find myself in arab street and in a generous mood i might give bar stories a try again but for now i am not recounting tales from this book,Positive
bar-stories,wow what an experience it is not often that you go into a bar and end up having a sipping the drink of the patrons next to you and you are not drunk but wow the peanut butter ice cream bourbon concoction was so damn good it had to be shared i would heard good things about bar stories no menu interactive you just tell the staff what you feel like our descriptions ranged from tropical spicy to a manly drink and something with passionfruit and zach and tilo name managed to hit the spot every time sitting at the bar was fun and entertaining we made friends with our new neighbors and the staff i do not think the experience is for everyone though it is pretty intense and full on so if you want just a quiet drink i would advise sitting at a table in a corner but it was so refreshing to have this interaction and watching them make the drinks was almost as good as drinking them yes it is a little pricey but not outrageous approx  per cocktail and they do not skimp on effort ingredients or quality and we were definitely a little happy on our way to our dinner reservations zach was an absolute star and the couple next to us wanted to take him home to australia to be the cocktail specialist at his th the only reason it does not get a  stars two of the staff were obviously in a relationship which do not get me wrong is fine but it seemed a little unprofessional to watch them canoodling behind the bar while working i actually felt a little awkward like i was intruding on their private moments or something it was just weird and seemed out of place but other than that perfect,Positive
bar-stories,the cocktail bar of choice for the upper middle class cmel crowd chinese middle class english speaking liberal at least for a while barstories is pretty very pretty it is got this beautiful sophisticated furniture all over a beautiful bar ample seating which is rare to come by sometimes in places like these it is also very popular clearly for good reasons yet i cannot help but feel the drinks are rather hit or miss i understand they take their mixology very seriously and like at everywhere else i entrust the satiation of my thirst to them to do whatever they heck they want half the time the drinks have been above average but never great hard to justify this sort of prices esp now that they have soooo many worthy competitors the other half of the time the drinks have just been downright abysmal it is very pricey even in the greater scheme of pricey cocktail bars and i cannot quite justify coming back too often unless there is an occasion or person that calls for more style over substance which is rarely,Positive
bar-stories,had a great time at this place always love finding a place with well mixed cocktails where the bartenders do actually care about what they are creating and not just making a few bucks between here and grad school few disclaimers  we went on a sunday night and there were only  people in the entire place  it was on a business trip so we were not so concerned with the pricemenuthere is no menu as some of the other reviews mentioned so you will start by telling the bartender mixologist if you are fancy the flavors you like and the liquor let them know if you want something sweet or a bit more boozey too that will help you out if you do not like your first cocktail tell them what you did not like they are not offended but will use that info to make you something better for round two atmospherei am not sure the name of our bartender but we had a good time hanging out at the bar they are great to talk with especially if you are a fan of a well mixed cocktail the place is cozy kind of at a random spot hidden in haji lane but as some other reviewers mentioned it is very small probably would impact service especially because all of the drinks are unique in some way it is a low key place too rustic modern so wear your skinny jeans and a button down with suede shoes you will fit right in haha just kidding wear whatever you want it is not a pretentious place i have a few survival tips to get good treatment at this bar  do not order a classic cocktail you can tell them you like the flavors in a gin and tonic but what is the point of going to a bar like this and ordering something you could get at every bar in the world let them do what they do best create cocktails  do not order anything with vodka i personally do not drink vodka and i do not have anything against it but in the craft cocktail world nothing makes a bartender is eyes roll than when you ask for vodka looking for adventure tell them you like spice if you are never had a cocktail with muddled thai chilis you should try one asap,Positive
bar-stories,i have gone a few times and had dramatically different experiences i have had  star experiences and  star so overall  stars seems to make sense so the general jist of the place is you go in and you get asked a few questions about your drink preferences and the bar tenders come up with something so first for my positive experiences i have always sat at the bar and it has been on slower nights tuesdays and thursdays usually from my experience actually getting to interact with the bartenders as they make your drinks really makes the experience worthwhile they actually pry further into what you like and you get to watch all the theatrics that go into making the drinks the wow factor is pretty big when you get your super elaborate drinks from the service pieces everything from martini glasses to mason jars to garnishes candy smoke foams etc to pyrotechnics it is all pretty impressive and the drinks do actually taste quite nice and it is not all just a show so my more negative experiences have been on busy nights seated at a table for one the waiters usually do not try as hard at getting to know your drink preferences as the actual bar tenders the wait time for the drinks is super long finally what sucks the most is when they get backed up they put far less effort into your cocktail basically you usually end up with a fruity martini or the likes not necessarily bad but just disappointing at over  a drink the former experience i mentioned felt worth it but the latter felt like a rip off so if you can catch the place on a slow night i highly recommend it but if it is busy pass for a different night,Positive
bar-stories,if you are looking for traditional cocktails this is not the place they do it too but they like to do things with a twist no fixed menu no fixed mixologist my first time here was a busy sat night even though we were there nearly at midnight the place was busy much too busy for the staff to cope we ordered and waited checked with the server and waited some more and waited the server ended up giving us a free shot of shoju each which was nice but we were really thirsty for our drinks we ended up getting our first drinks   hr later the next few times were pre dinner drinks so it was much better and we got a seat at the bar which guaranteed immediate attention drinks here are fancy and sometimes a little too sweet for our liking the place is homely and nice with exposed brick walls and nice couches plus it is set in a shophouse in the cool haji lane to my angmo friends it felt like their homes and yeah you do pay for fancy drinks so watch your orders as the bill can easily pile up ps i still kind of prefer nektar personally drinks are not so fancy and better made,Positive
bar-stories,absolutely loved loved loved barstories zak made us both the most amazing cocktails and my wife swears the one she had was the best cocktail ever cannot wait to get back to singapore to revisit my favorite cocktail bar highly recommended,Positive
bar-stories,i know this bar is sort of a singapore cocktail scene institution i get that when these guys opened up and started making specialist cocktails in a shophouse on haji lane people were interested it was different it was quaint it was cool but this is  and bar stories has been eclipsed by the likes of jigger pony horse is mouth cufflink club etc the drinks just are not that great and they have a habit of making embarrassing missteps like serving cocktails in martini glasses that have not been chilled properly also the no menu bullshit is starting to wear thin and if you want to be a specialist cocktail bar it is totally unforgivable that you only have two single malt whiskeys available on any given night that there is shameful moreover you might offer patrons drinks with no name based on a flavour or a base spirit preference but if i order an old fashioned or a bloody mary and you do not execute well why should i trust you with a random fruity concoction sorry bar stories every time i have been here i have been underwhelmed by the drinks and raised one eyebrow at the experience if friends drag me back here now i just order macallan  on the rocks but i do like the chilli cheese fries,Negative
bar-stories,i would been interested in visiting bar stories after hearing about bespoke cocktails and was finally able to drop by we were pretty useless at ordering because we are not usually cocktail drinkers so we did not know what to say about taste profiles i ended up asking for something vodka based and sweet while my fianc asked for something like a white russian i do not know what we eventually for except that they were both tasty another mixologist explained what he was making to some other customers but our mixologist did not really tell us i suppose it is not that big a deal we enjoyed our drinks anyway the bill came up to around  for the two of us so do be prepared for that alcohol is not cheap in singapore anyway i do not think i will visit again but it is definitely a nice place to go with friends and enjoy the surprise of a customised drink,Negative
bar-stories,you know when you are growing up and you always had a friend who had an effortlessly cool older brother or sister just being in their presence made you feel gawky and awkward well singapore bars your uber hip older sibling has just arrived on the scene bar stories sits on haji lane amongst the quirky independent shops that are growing in number there it is small intimate and incredibly welcoming something not a lot of the cool bars in singapore can pull off there is no menu so everyone is treated to a personal cocktail consultation when they arrive asking you whether you prefer sweet or sour fruity strong flavors etc until they have an idea of your palate tastes you can then sit and watch as great care is taken over the mix and the presentation of your drink they are served in a wide variety of glasses jars bottles to make you feel very special my drinking partner is whiskey based cocktail for example came complete with a beautiful small paper boat containing some crystallized ginger the ambiance and background music have been carefully chosen to compliment the experience i would highly recommend this to bring a date to impress him or her for a celebratory outing or just anytime you want something personal to feel special and to unwind after a long day,Positive
bar-stories,after my poor experience at maison ikkoku chris a and i wandered over to bar stories our verdict much better the atmosphere was more relaxed and not as pretentious the waiter taking our order also took time to carefully walk us through our drinks to make sure our feelings or desires married well and that the end result did not taste funny i came here again tonight with a few girlfriends and the bartenders truly took time to make our drinks extra special from an ice sculpture to burning a rosemary candle our server also came by to shine a flashlight so we had proper lightening for pictures thank you i do prefer the drinks at maison ikkoku though since they tend to be stronger but bar stories takes reservations on fridays saturdays and sundays unlike maison ikkoku price point wise are about the same roughly  per drink overall will def continue to come back,Positive
bar-stories,a very unique place that should be on anyones must visit list well almost anyone some friends i took listened to the introduction then asked for beers on tap and a wine list they are not the target audience the concept with this bar is no menus just a discussion with the bartender and a customized drink is brought out for you in my many visits here i have only had one less than stellar visit and that was because our particular bartender that night just did not interact well with us not fun good drinks but not exciting every other visit is fun with the bartender discussing your tastes and pushing you to try something new and expand your tastes the service is above and beyond in fact one visit my wife was explaining that she does not like gin and a voice from across the room yelled out you do too like gin the last two times you were here i served you gin two things about this  we are not that regular but they remembered us  they push you to try new things that even you do not realize you like the drinks are not just mixed cocktails but they are complete experiences a table of four will likely have something flaming some herb or unique fruit and maybe even a merengue no two visits are the same and no two drinks are the same it is a great experience and definitely a place to go with friends you will share drinks with to try it all ps i do advise making reservations we have been lucky just walking up but making a reservation ahead is advisable and allows you to request a bar seat which is the best experience,Positive
bar-stories,what a neat little gem a friend from the u s visited bar stories last year i have wanted to go ever since i absolutely adore the concept they do not have a menu they ask you some questions to try to figure out your tastes and make you a custom personalised cocktail we went to bar stories on a thursday evening around   they were full but they accommodated us by putting us at a big shared table the staff was very friendly and attentive it did take a long time to actually receive our drinks but that is understandable each cocktail is crafted to beautiful perfection my husband had a whiskey lemon grass and walnut martini i had a mint grape bellini both of the drinks were beautiful and tasted great as well in the future we will make reservations i think this would be a great place to take visiting friends it us pricey but worth the experience we went back to bar stories and had the opportunity to sit at the bar the bar tender has an awesome personality and we loved watching him create art the drinks at bar stories are truly art,Positive
bar-stories,apart from the wait the service was pretty good with creative drinks ideas the bartenders are friendly and helpful if you are unsure of what to order i did not mind the wait as i get to witness the drinks being made on the spot pretty good for those who are indecisive and who love surprises well recommended for those who are on a date i love the cozy ambience of the place it fits well for couples alcoholic drinks and non alcoholic drinks are charged at  and  respectively excluding service charge,Positive
bar-stories,nice cosy environment the drinks here are really quite pricey but if you chat up the bartender properly he will mix you up something interesting depending on what your taste is i went for sweet and had a strawberry cheesecake that tasted disconcertingly like cake still rather pricey and not something you can indulge in all the time,Positive
bar-stories,the art of mixology is something bar stories has truly become a master of my first experience with bar stories was about a year ago and i have not stopped coming back since from the minute you enter bar stories is an experience each bartender is an expert in mixology and surprisingly in your tastes you wo not the regular after work drinks here or even a menu for them you will be asked what your favorite flavors are whether you like sweet or sour what your preferred liquor is and how strong you would like your drink to be the staff are extremely friendly and you wont find yourself without conversation while you watch the mixologists get to work there is also a short food menu with a few bites to nibble on while you wait for your drinks the drinks themselves are delicious my current favorite is a trip to japan a little bit on the pricey side the drinks can range from   a pop perfect for an after work drink,Positive
bar-stories,it was my first time here and i loved it come in tell them what flavors you like and bam you get a wonderful cocktail just like magic you can stay in the homey bar if you need to cool off but i prefer to sit outside on haji street for some interesting people watching and to check out the colorful storefronts if ever in singapore again i would stop by for a cocktail they are worth the  each,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,i loved the aquarium i had fun it was amazing it was well worth the advance purchase online to avoid the long lines and it helped it was a little cheaper than at the ticket counter this aquarium is located in sentosa island we took the cable cars here since it is located towards the back by the cable car exit as you enter the aquarium you walk through a heat scan for coronavirus at least it is better safe than sorry the aquarium size is pretty big and all surrounded by water my favorite part was seeing the shark tank full of different sized sharks these were amazing to see my other favorite was seeing the jellyfishes i got stung by them and just wanted to see these gentle but vicious sea creatures i saw some ugly and unique sea creatures the glass walls of these tanks were at least five inches thick the staff here really takes care of this place i saw one guy in a wet suit wiping the glass walls carefully to not disturb the fish great place to visit if you are a tourist and first time in singapore well worth my advance purchase,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,top  attractions in singapore i have been to several aquariums around the world something about the deep mysteries of the sea fascinates me with more than   marine animals of over   species across into  different habitats sea aquarium is definitely worth the visit what you should not miss out check the time and stick around for the feeding at the main aquarium here you will see scuba divers feeding the manta rays and other marine animals inside sea aquarium is a great attraction for all ages i spent a good two to three hours inside another favorite of mine was seeing the sheer size of the giant japanese spider crab the location is adjacent to universal studios so if it may be possible to visit both parks in a single day,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,the aquarium is on a fun part of the country called sentosa island seems like a fun place to bring kids on a nice family day the aquarium is a little smaller than i thought it would be and incredibly hectic as you would expect most aquariums to be the reason i gave this place at  star was because i saw three dead or dying fish not saying that fish can never die but for a fish to get that dud and to be seen by the public eye does not happen over a few minutes or even a few hours and seldomly even half a day to a day those large fish had to have been dead long enough for caretakers of the place to not notice although they have a decent selection i cannot look past the dead fish since i have never seen that an aquarium before definitely took videos but did not take pictures of the dead fish,Negative
s-e-a-aquarium,one of the best aquariums i have ever been to although the universal studios next door probably pulls larger crowds this aquarium is definitely a ppace worth stopping by especially if you want to avoid the head outside on a hot singaporean summer day located on sentosa island s e a aquarium is a bit out of the ways for people visiting the main island of singapore despite that fact given how small singapore is it does not take that long to get over here i rode over on a grab ride for only  singaporean dollars so if distance is your big worry fear not as for the attractions i think the aquarium is pretty comprehensive it has exhibits on almost all the oceans of the world except for the arctic and the aquarium with stingrays is particularly beautiful visit if you are close by,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,s e a was definitely one of the best aquariums i have ever visited it is on sentosa island it was large but very walkable there were so many sights that i lost track of how far we had gone some of my favorites the jellyfish displays were beautiful i loved the way they lit that those tanks they are such weird creatures with such variety the glass tunnel inside the shark tank everyone loved this display sharks were swimming all around you even above we were able to see the underbelly of these predators they were swimming so close that we could look right into their eyes feedings happen at certain times at the giant central tank make sure you do not miss it the diver was feeding the fish that were swarming him one of the tanks had a shipwreck in it it provided great hiding places for the critters there were other general tanks that housed a variety of fish the colors and mix was extraordinary if you are visiting sentosa make sure to carve out some time to go to the aquarium,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,this is a nice aquarium but it was extremely crowded i could not fully enjoy this place and rushed through it i did not want to knock it to three stars because this is a really nice aquarium the jellies are a great section and i love the underwater walkway do not miss the giant wall of sea creatures either it is phenomenal if you buy the bundle online you can get tickets here for free,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,i choose this as fauna part of the attraction to my singapore itenary compared to the bird park zoo river and night safari is which all hold certain titles and awards the sea had more animals that were pertinant to the area around singapore and the south seas it is building lies on the lovely but commercialized island of sentosa which neighbors universal studios premise itself was large and maintained glasses above made you feel as though you were really in the ocean the best part was actually the first part which was the tunnel of sharks it contained various shark species like the nurse and hammerhead sharks other galleries pertained to fishes and creatures mostly within the malaca straights and south indo seas one thing this aquarium could have were more mammals and birds,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,decent sized aquarium this one is unique because they have other exhibits besides just looking at fish and sharks they have an old wooden ship on display and have a quick movie too for  the staff were very knowledgeable and answered a lot of my questions i am used to seeing aquariums being super packed with kids and families but i came in when there were not as much people although there were lots of people walking around in sentosa again plenty of room to walk around in the shark exhibit was very cool,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,we booked a tour through our travel agency and it appears to me that everyone that goes to sentosa in a group follows their group all day the sea aquarium just so happen to be on our schedule for the day i was super excited it was actually a lot of fun and probably one of he best things to do at sentosa the aquarium itself walk through is about an hour deff longer if you have children as anything would be it is incredibly crowded and families literally push you out of the way to get their kids the best spot which is pretty annoying but if you can grasp a breath of patience the views are incredible i have only ever seen a walk through shark tank at the mall of america so it was really exciting to see again there is beautifully jelly fish tanks and dolphins it is so much fun the end display is a massive tank that is bigger than a theater stage highly recommend the visit the views right outside are incredible too,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,beautiful aquarium full of various sea creatures to admire the main attraction is the large wall aquarium with sharks stingrays groupers and various fishes its an amazing location to go when you are in sentosa the kids will enjoy the interactive tank where you can touch the starfishes,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,enjoyable morning walking through the aquarium we were the first few in lines and i think it is best to come early the aquarium is a decent size but packed with informations entrance fee is  per person but you can find cheaper deal online i got ours for  per pax we spent about  hours here and ended our visit perfectly because there was a feeding time at  pm,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,this is a wonderful attraction for people of all ages the aquarium is designed in a wave like fashion so that you walk in one direction and can visit all of the exhibits without having to stray from the main path this is great for children strollers and adults with ocd and or add i loved seeing the different oceanic environments and also all of the educational booths setup to teach kids about ocean conservation there were so many interesting ocean critters to see here and the tanks looked well maintained my favorite exhibits were the jellyfish and pufferfish exhibits i have never seen so many puffers cohabiting in the same waters in peace so that was exciting most aquariums have   puffers max but this one has dozens of them in various tanks,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,really enjoyed all the exhibits here they have a lot of different tropical fish they also have a nice day exhibit i loved the different designs they have they also have a section where you can pay extra for a ride that puts you into the same situation sailors on the silk road would be in really engaging experience there are plenty of different ecosystems here for you to check out and it is a pretty big place so i suggest you give yourself at least  minutes to walk around and learn about the place,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,you will not find a finer aquarium anywhere on either the western or eastern hemisphere if you want your jaw to be dropped for several hours seriously check this place out,Negative
s-e-a-aquarium,favorites aspects there is a touch pool where you can reach your hand into the water and touch a starfish and sea cucumber the sea cucumber was so soft i was almost delirious in a good way they have a good variety of fish and sea animals i thoroughly enjoyed reading the posters to learn a little more about each species they have a giant octopus and dolphins i also really enjoyed the jellyfish section really beautiful creatures family friendly activity this is one of those tourist activities that the whole family can enjoy,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,when we visited sentosa we got a special package visit which included the aquarium and universal studios to be honest we were more interested in the aquarium and it is certainly worth a visit in fact there were two sections a museum piece that chronicled the martime silk road that took you to the various stops along the route and then the aquarium itself which is actually pretty large they do have another theme park on top adventure cove which means that you may not get to see the dolphins when you pass the dolpin tank however there are plenty actually heaps of other fish to marvel at including a couple of huge tanks which you walk under and a third one that takes up an entire wall of an ampitheatre pretty impressive if you like fish,Negative
s-e-a-aquarium,it is nice that is all i have to really say about here it is also overcrowded but i went on a weekend i do not even know why i bothered little children everywhere squeezing in front of everybody to stick their face onto the glass sigh then you have got everyone else taking selfies in front of them it is so hectic never ever pay the full  dollars adult price i would not have gone if i had to fork out that much you can definitely get it cheaper from other websites online like klook or buy a package deal for the other activities on the island i managed to get mine for  when you first enter in the aquarium it is a little confusing where to go there is a projector in front of you showing a video and then to the left of them is the counter to show your ticket and get in you are taken through an exhibition on geography then you get to the first floor with a giant noah is ark and some recycled art after that it is on to the fishes and sea creatures i think i have just been to many stellar aquariums that this one seemed to lack variety many of the exhibits just seem very similar a lot of fish in one tank however the giant tank was quite different and it was nice seeing an octopus that was actually active around it is tank usually most just hide in a corner that i have seen,Negative
s-e-a-aquarium,while in singapore i was invited to explore this amazing s e a aquarium at resort world sentosa i have been to many aquariums in the past and s e a aquarium is one of the best in term of beautiful displays and home to more than   marine animals of over  species upon entering there is an enormous chinese type treasure ship floating in mid air on the front of the ship is a video display and shows a video regarding sea expedition the first tank display is a giant shipwreck next a shark sea tunnel with full of various shark species endangered species such as the scalloped hammerhead shark silvertip shark and the sandbar shark sandbar shark is one of the largest coastal sharks in the world after that just follow the line to all the other tanks and fishes until you reach the open ocean display in the open ocean habitat countless of rays sharks and other fishes attract viewers through a giant glass wall this is my favorite due to the size of tank with probably the largest window in the world and it is breathtaking overall i really enjoy my time in s e a aquarium it is a great outing for families with children,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,this is a wonderful aquarium and that is from someone who loves aquariums the large and varies exhibits focus on lots of different habitats perhaps the most varied that i have seen they do a nice job of focusing on somewhat local asia and south asia geographies and it is quite interesting to see the change in marine life as you make your way across the region without leaving sentosa it was also a really fun place for kids i went with my wife my sister and my  month old niece and we just had a blast many of the tanks are low to the ground to allow the little ones to press the faces up to the glass to see the cool creatures inside my niece just loved watching the multicolored fish go by and in particular the sea jellies float around en masse the exhibits with higher viewing points also mostly had wide ledges so that kids could sit or stand on them to get a view even though it was a bit crowded it was wide enough to push a stroller comfortably in most places definitely worth a stop while wandering resorts world,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,i loved this aquarium i had so much fun here the large tani was bigger than the medium sized office building i work in we went on a friday and it was still quite busy,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,stars probably one of the best aquariums that i have ever been to we got the  attraction pass for sentosa and one of the included items was the s e a aquarium again this was a nice way to cool off as the entire place was air conditioned you first walk through a glass tunnel with lots of sharks floating around and above you we were not here for the feeding times so we did not get to witness that however the most impressive part of the aquarium was the huge viewing area open ocean wow so big and incredible with tons of fish and stingrays if you are heading to sentosa make sure you stop by this aquarium,Negative
s-e-a-aquarium,i love to scuba dive its one of the great things about living in this part of the world ive been here for  years and never really thought about visiting the aquarium no particular reason i just never heard much about it and never tried to make it over so one weekend i had  friends visiting and one of them wanted to go so we paid it a visit oh man it was awesome such a great viewing experience i enjoyed how it was separated by region it showcased the different ecosystems and the sea life in these areas there is actually alot of good information to be had but sadly people didnt seem that interested in reading it the viewing tanks are amazing and this place is well worth the visit there are a couple things to keep in mind it gets crowded on the weekend kids are running everywhere most arent that supervised and are either tripping over you jumping over you or trying to climb over you if they arent busy playing on their ipads which is a crime at a place like this id suggest going on a weekday if you can the other thing that bothered me was the utter lack of any information about the effect we have on our ocean environment or things we can do to protect our ocean environment i really think they should include some kind of take home message on the frailty of our oceans and things we can do to preserve them,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,i got discounted tickets through the cruise i was on i was quite excited because the advertisement had a picture of a whale shark which led me to believe they had one the exhibits were clean informative and well laid out what they lacked was a whale shark what i found instead was a mural painting of a whale shark there were much better things i could have done with my day without being bamboozled,Negative
s-e-a-aquarium,this is really cool place to visit and it really made me feel like a kid again if you do not have much time in singapore and it is raining outside i would recommend to come here we ended up spending  hours here the tickets for  adults are under   to get in however it costs  for a return journey on monorail,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,wonderful aquarium we went on a saturday afternoon so it was quite crowded but we still enjoyed ourselves they have a great exhibit on sea trading between countries when you first enter and a ginormous ship front that opens for a show periodically we did not stay to watch that performance i wanted to get to the fish the underwater tunnels are great lots of different sea life swimming over you the moving walkways were not working and it was very crowded in this particular area not for the claustrophobic the tanks once you pass by the tunnels are where it is at for me i particularly enjoyed the jellyfish and the seahorses some tanks have magnification bubbles to allow you to really see the creatures up close too cool the open ocean tank is the main focus of the aquarium it is supposed to be the largest in the world there is stadium style viewing in one part and a ocean view area that juts into the tank in another i would compare this to the ocean view at atlanta georgia is aquarium the main difference between the  is that singapore is does not have the whale sharks do not get me wrong it is impressive and worth sitting down just to watch everything circle by you maybe they will put some larger fish in to the tanks in the future we really enjoyed our visit and i would go again just not on the weekend,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,if you are visiting singapore and want a really amazing experience do the vip tour package at  am and get a private experience without the crowds luckily it was just the three of us without other people not having other people made it great since you go at your own pace in addition it is a huge difference without the business hour crowds for the first   hours it is quiet relaxed and like visiting your friend is home our tour guide was great she really explained everything really well this is where you really get your money is worth the back room behind closed door experiences to see what goes on here was great wear light clothing it can get very hot behind closed doors especially in the jelly fish section also seeing the open ocean exhibit behind the scenes was a real eye opener just amazing to see it from up above,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,do not miss simulation hurricane ship ride on  degree big imax screen the seats moving with storm and get splash with real water on the seating area thrill ride with only extra  sin for  minute ride aquarium admission relatively cheap special fare for local residents compare to other country aquariums the s e a magnificent wide screen aquarium one of the best in the world beside the beautiful entry aquatic tunnel i never seen any aquarium cover so many rare fish of the world i wish they place some benches to accommodate seniors to rest along the big screen aquarium stage area there was scheduled underwater fish feedings and special chinese new year celebration event with lion dance in the big screen pool on the plaza there are budget asian food court with affordable local foods i recommend take monorail from the mainland habour front mrt station to santosa island singapore tourism still have handicap accessibility problems around the tourist attractions,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,not the best aquarium i have seen sure there are a lot of tanks but it is so crowded you cannot see much i saw more people taking selfies than fish it is really annoying anyway i liked the old aquarium better,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,i only got to spend a little over a day in singapore but this aquarium was my favorite spot to visit it is a huge place but also not so big that it is overwhelming it took us about  hours to walk through the entire aquarium there were several exhibits and everything about the aquarium was well organized and nicely spaced it was just so absolutely cool but only if you like sealife and a museum type atmosphere,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,oh sweet jesus this place is amazing i cannot help but wonder how underwater world is going to survive now that this behemoth of an aquarium is large and in charge when you first enter the building there is this huge ship in the middle of the hall almost reminiscent of what noah is ark would have looked like before you enter the actual aquarium you walk through an exhibit that showcases the history of sea trading amongst southeast asian countries lots of stuff to look at some interactive great for kids but not my cuppa tea then you go downstairs and that is where the fun at least for me begins similar to underwater world you walk in a tunnel that has a moving walkway which surprisingly was not functional on the both times i was there you are then surrounded by awesome fishies swimming around but wait there is h mooooore there are various aquariums of different shapes and sizes each with different underwater denizens so many pretty colors if you are on instagram there is seriously no need to use any filters the one aquarium that steals the show is the open ocean it is apparently the world is largest window to the ocean according to the official website it is out of control and out of this world i love watching the sting rays swim along and the schools of fish that swim above and below them almost as if they are catching a ride the background music they play is a bit ominous though but it reminds me of the beginning of beauty and the beast when they were telling the story with the help of the stained glass windows anyone remember that my second favorite is the shark seas which is basically a tank full of sharks the only thing that would make it more awesome is if they had frikken laser beams attached to their heads so if you are like me and not interested in learning how to scuba dive any time soon make a trip to the sea and enjoy,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,s e a stands for south east asiafrom what i heard this is the biggest oceanarium in the world they even have a maritime museum upstairs the aquarium is real good you can see lots of sea creatures behind those immaculate aquarium glass walls the main attraction is the gigantic tank i forgot what is the name of this zone you can sit and relax in front of the said tank sometimes there will be divers waving at you from inside the tank my only complain is the fact that it is too crowded on the weekend and public holidays i felt as if i was trapped in a submarine with a plethora of people buzzing around,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,amazing aquarium lots of variety and very well maintained the main aquarium is spectacular the biggest i have ever seen all the fish look healthy and happy in the environment only disappointment was we waited for minutes for feeding but when the time came an announcement was made due to inclement weather feeding time was cancelled inclement weather what tha it is a bloody aquarium they could have told everyone earlier instead of letting everyone wait and they should have come up with a better excuse,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,this by far was the best aquarium my family and i have visited it is filled with huge aquariums filled with lots of sea life my children enjoyed it tremendously during our time in singapore this past february if you are traveling with kids this is a must see during your trip the aquarium is located in sentosa which has a lot of neat restaurants and attractions universal studios is also close by,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,world is largest aquarium it is amazing overwhelming and yet peaceful i will definitely go back if i visit singapore next time,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,the aquarium is gorgeous of coarse but i just got schooled in the most condescending voice by a woman who is suppose to be an educator in coral conservation at the singapore sentosa sea aquarium unfortunately i felt put down rather than feeling like i came here and learnt something knowledge does not mean an entitlement and please stop thinking you are the only one who loves animals,Negative
s-e-a-aquarium,this the best aquarium i have had the pleasure of visiting it is really large and there are a ton of different animals the coolest one being the manta ray take your time here you can easily spend a couple hours just marveling at everything apparently the restaurant here is also very good and headed by chef cat cora,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,very crowded rather expensive for foreigners but overall it was quite interesting to see might be very nice if you go early in the morning or during the week,Positive
s-e-a-aquarium,supposedly this is the world is largest aquarium or so i was told by the people of singapore well whether if it is the biggest in the world or not it is the biggest aquarium i have ever been to the aquarium is located in resort world sentosa with universal studios singapore marine life park the aquarium belongs to this trick eye museum dolphin island and some waterpark this part represents just a small part of everything you can do on sentosa island seriously so much to do here my  day spent in singapore unfortunately only allowed me to do so much and luckily s e a aquarium was on that list one of the coolest things about this museum was the very interactive and realistic movie of some ship being the in a typhoon beware you even get small kine wet the best part was walking out of the movie and seeing the aquarium with a sunken ship and the aquatic life that thrive around it the rest of the aquarium was pretty amazing too there were bajillions of different sea animals to be seen all of which i do not remember the exact names of but i liked looking at all of them the tanks were separated between geographic location as well as area of the ocean only sad thing was that they did not have whale sharks say what practically every large aquarium in asia has one get on it s e a aquarium and they did not have many sea creatures that you could touch which i am sure is a good thing actually since i think our very dirty hands could make them very sick they actually have photo taking sessions within the aquarium where they randomly take photos of you but those damn  by s were s  for one photo yeah not within my budget s e a aquarium should definitely be in your agenda if you are ever in singapore for enough time it is right next to universal studios singapore so you can do two things in one day,Negative
straitskitchen,definitely the best buffet place in town i been here twice and both dint disappoint they change the menu for variety but the taste was top notch i had biryani with couple of spicy curries pappadams and a potato pancake which was great from their malay menu i tried sayur lodeh sambal ikan bilis kicap and couple more dishes together with mutton and beef satay they were amazing their roti jala with curry impressed me i also had their fried rice which was flavorful despite their lack of color oh and the star dish of the night definitely the laksa you could put just any ingredients up to your liking and that huge dollop of sambal definitely sealed the deal i am in food heaven,Positive
straitskitchen,yes this is a hotel restaurant so prices come with the territory but it is a solid and dependable one particularly if you need to conduct a business meeting over a meal with international audience or if you are a visitor yourself and are looking for a safe accessible introduction into regional cuisine there is a large comprehensive buffet at traditional meal times all day long but you can also order a la carte which i did on a recent late night the carrot cake for example is not the western dessert but is instead a local specialty that is similar to the turnip cake lo bak go that you will see in cantonese dim sum houses it packed in lots of comforting carbs alongside some protein radish turnip egg shrimp chilli paste in such a complementary way that i did not realize where the shrimp ended and where the radish and turnips began service is polished as is expected of such a sophisticated setting a great way to catch up with colleagues or friends in a professional environment,Positive
straitskitchen,the variety freshness overall quality availability of local cuisines the atmospheric setup and ambiance are really fine unique and great for bigger gatherings and special occasions the price is high and therefore makes this a place that is more suitable for business outings or one time visits for the general public i think it is true that you can easily find the individual types of food served here at all corners of singapore but the fact that you can simply walk around and pick and choose what you would like to eat and enjoy the most helps increase the joy of coming to this place the general service is very average at best and possibly slow as often dirty dishes pile up or you have to wait and look for someone to help you with refreshment refills,Positive
straitskitchen,hmmm another establishment in town that i am indeed torn about for the finale dinner to say farewell to my good friend who is also a fellow yelper trip to singapore i made a reservation here for our last hurrah dinner yes there are plenty to choose from and eat majority of the food that were featured that evening are the items you can find at our local hawker centre but in a atas setting aka air conditioned and more comfortable setting without sweating or in this case without me glowing in my own glow our reservation was on a tuesday evening at  hrs once wearrived at that time we are ushered to our table once seated we went through the different food station to see what straits kitchen has to offer that evening highlights for the dinner buffet were these following items satay freshly charcoal grilled to order petai sambal prawns spicyok items were the rendang and some of the condiments the popiah are made to order though i cannot deny the dressing of the tamarind spread inside the popiah was way too much for my liking and not much of oomph aka no wow factor sigh disappointed items were sotong sambal fish and ginger crabsdo not get me wrong most of the seafood items are either lukewarm or overcooked especially in this instance the sotong and sambal fish maybe its a tuesday evening so did not get the chance to eat or have the chilli crab instead they offer the ginger crabs thank god for the desserts else i would not be a happy camper all in all its hits and misses dinner buffet here maybe i went on their off day perhaps will return say in  years time that would be the earliest else i will wait for another  years time unless straits kitchen can convinced me otherwise there are many more items to eat but since i am stuffed that evening or perhaps so the after taste of slight disappointment we decide to end our dinner with the desserts by about  hrs ish one of the server just gave us a complimentary chocolate cake without even telling us what was it or anything from the conversations i had when i made the reservation i knew what it was from the reservation staffs but that evening it was a let down service from this server double sigh the service was ok throughout our dinner service i expect more from a high caliber hotel or establishment per say in this case grand hyatt since straits kitchen received its halal certification by muis that alone received  stars in my books to end this is one of the establishment that one of my favorite chefs the late chef anthony bourdain went to chef you are dearly missed,Negative
straitskitchen,had lunch here today absolutely wonderful with authentic singaporean food wide variety good service and beautiful atmosphere over ate as usual,Positive
straitskitchen,straitskitchen in the grand hyatt is worth the stopover if you are in the area bourdain gave this place his approval and so do i it is a fantastic way to try all the local cuisines in one place without having to order  different dishes it is a buffet so you can sample a little of everything from local malay chinese and indian cuisines the malay station had otah otah freshly grilled in banana leaves stingray smothered in sambal beef rendeng chicken lamb mutton satay and that peanut sauce is to die for down by the desserts the station continues with made to order rojak and popiah i only wish they had the famous singaporean chili crab or salted egg crab the chinese station had peppered crab winter melon soup and various stir fried dishes the noodle station had every kind of singaporean noodle you can think of prawn mee laksa fish ball noodle soup and so many other options the bbq station had roasted duck steamed chicken and soy sauce chicken chicken rice straight from the rice cooker too all the condiments for your liking to boot the indian station had roti naan and tons of saucy dishes to go with your carbs the dessert selection is wide ranging from sweet soups tang shui to baked and steamed kuehs to mango puddings and grass jellies and tropical ice cream service was excellent they servers wi refill your water as soon as you take a sip and remove your plate when you get up when they see crab on your place they will place a bowl of warm water and lemon for rinsing i only wish i had a bigger stomach so i can try everything they were all so good definitely recommend if your time in sg is limited but you are a fatty and wanna try everything like me as of october  it came out to  a person for dinner,Positive
straitskitchen,to be clear this place is very good lol i mean you are inside the grand hyatt where all things are fancy and immaculate the most impressive lobby with grand entrances and flower arrangements so you would expect the restaurants to be up to the par and have to say the are we ate at both straitskitchen and scott straitskitchen dinner buffet was very tasty there were many food stations just from memory chinese malaysian indian greek japanese and i think there was a few more there was even a juice station with  different fresh squeezed juice options there were also several dessert stations too one for traditional treats then icecream then deep fry shaved ice we came during ramadan so the restaurant told us that meant there will be additional dishes of food but the cost will be bit more around  per person so i am giving it  stars because everything about the restaurant is specular really enjoyed it but it was just a bit pricey would recommend if have short amount of time and want to sample all the different cultural cuisine this is good or celebrating an occasion because it has just great atmosphere,Positive
straitskitchen,scotts wonderful tea time spread and pretty attentive staff but do not expect the staff to be able to explain the food ingredients but they are well informed about the the  tier dessert tray that comes to you somewhere in the middle of your tea best of all they had the good sense to have a separate section for those of us who simply want to read and catch up on the news mezza excellent food but the service staff were too casual and chatty martini bar at mezza wonderful people staff and guests often short handed on staff but the exquisite ambiance more than makes up for this straitskitchen for a five star restaurant the staff was a disappointment and the food was good not wonderful what i love best of hyatt here and around the world apart from the wonderful architecture lavish floors and flowers is that the staff are well groomed and the fabric of their uniforms show they are respected by management and of course you get a lot of good food and leave with a sense of well being for all these reasons hyatt is the best  star hotel in singapore based on what i have experienced as a diner,Positive
straitskitchen,not cheap by any means but my favorite restaurant in singapore super fresh and authentic cuisine from around southeast asia great service too,Positive
straitskitchen,every year i make a reservation at the hyatt straitskitchen in order to sample a huge selection of food that singapore has to offer in a short space of time yummiest foods laksa we had  bowls of this need i say more rojak chicken rice lackluster popiah always a huge line but a little disappointing ice kachang desserts not very satisfying we noticed that while there were huge crowds when we went i am guessing because hotel is in a prime location they lacked servers and a few staff had to run back and forth between multiple food stands to serve food that was prepared in a rushed manner i think this will be the last time we dine there the quality of food seems to have gone downhill over the years our palates were not happy enough to justify the prices they charge but straitskitchen for the years you filled our bellies with local goodies we are eternally grateful,Positive
straitskitchen,straitsrestaurant is the grand hyatt is all you can eat singapore style buffet made famous by anthony bourdain is layover singapore episode had dinner there tonight and the set up looks pretty much like it did on that program cost to eat here is about us per person after that it is eat as much food as your stomach will hold here is where the dilemma starts after you are seated what to do the staff will give you a tour and the set up is like any you see in vegas but difference the food quality is pretty amazing it broken down into at least five different eating stations there is the  indian station where you will have about three or  kinds of naan plain naan and garlic naan saffron basmati rice plenty of curry dishes from fish chicken and lamb curry then there are tandooris kebabs and then there is prawn tandoori after that you have the  chinese station that serves chicken rice with all the condiments including cilantro ginger sauce chopped red or green peppers etc roast duck and pork wok dishes including chili black pepper crab fried rice steamed fish singapore style chow mein and other stuff along with key toppings there is all sorts of soup noodles here including laksa hot and sour noodle soup shredded chicken noodle soup etc the there is the  malay section with satay grilled chicken beef lamb on a stick with a peanut dipping sauce super strong and flavorful red onions and hot sauce bbq otak otak and sambal fish sayor lodeh mixed veggies with coconut gravy cucur sayor vegetable fritters and some other itemsthen there is the  beverage area where you can make an english coffee espresso or any kind of a coffee various drinks from mango to cucumber juice to cool sweet chinese herbal tea my favorite was rose milk something entirely unique and very tasty lastly  there is the dessert section which has all sorts of goodies including gelatos including durian yummmy and sorbets various indian and malay sweets like barfi assorted nonya kueh warm sweet dessert soups like pulut hitam and coconut cream sweet potato paste and ginko nuts and yet even other sweet things it is been five hours since i was there and my stomach is still expanding my advice to anyone who eats here do not be overly ambitious because it is too much food even if you take just a bite or two of each dish other advice is that you do not drink alcohol you cannot afford the space in your stomach for it more advice have a alka seltzer afterwards still more advice do not lie on your back for at least  hours or you will get nauseous while this place is an excellent way to crash course in singapore it is simply too much the service from the servers to the food servers is pretty much nd to none and the quality is pretty decent you will find better if you explore singapore but you wo not be disappointed the dining atmosphere is a tad claustrophobic for an upscale hotel like the grand hyatt i did not feel comfortable being placed too closely to other parties whose conversations intersected mine i also did not like the lack of vegetables yes there was a salad bar but the food there was invaded by a few invasive fruit flies major atmosphere killer and very low scale despite my qualms i am partly to blame for overeating definitely worth a try if you only have a few days and are just passing by singapore like i am otherwise you have a week to search throughout and find the best quality out there,Positive
straitskitchen,straitskitchen is located inside the grand hyatt hotel on scotts road it is actually buffet style but this is more vegas quality than hometown buffet quality everything they serve here is top notch and inline with everything else at this  star hotel breakfast is free when you stay here on my first morning i was like a fat kid at a candy store i was blown away with the amount of food selection and the quality of the choices each and every station had someone stationed there either cooking or ensuring that all the food is elegantly presented and well stocked the host does a great job of remembering my name and always thanked me for my patronage there is a fresh omelette station where the cook will make you a custom omelette a porridge station with all the fixins the way mama used to make it dim sum with wonton soup and fresh veggies an indian food area delicious fancy pastries oatmeal cereal belgian waffles with real maple syrup and nutella fresh fruits juice and a coffee machine if you prefer ask the guy behind the counter to make you a tea malik or coffee malik both very good for dinner they also have some great singaporean choices such as satay with their meats grilled over a real wooden flame prawns crab salad rice cakes char kway teow and many dessert choices it is pretty difficult to not find something here for everyone as they feature cuisines from all parts of asia pretty pricey at  sgp but when it is hot outside and you do not feel like leaving the comforts of the hotel and enjoy the fantastic service provided by the staff and cannot get enough of the beautiful decor of this restaurant then this place is a no brainer,Positive
straitskitchen,i stayed at the hyatt for a few nights and while my time was limited i was trying to find somewhere to be able to try all the variety of cuisines singapore has to offer well as i started to look up places i find out hyatts very own kitchen is highly regarded so im a sucker for trying anything once amazinngggggg the foods were authentic the unlimited black pepper crabs were awesome the waiters bring you a bowl to clean your hands as well i wont say much more except if your time is short and you want a little taste of everything this is the spot,Positive
straitskitchen,had a reservation here one sunday in june hosted a friend who lived in my condo building back in atlanta i wanted my friend to try out the different variety of local food personally i feel there was no better place to try so many local items in a comfortable environment than at straits kitchen grand hyatt lunch includes a free flow of   types of juices there were many stations each serving different ethnic food there were like indian chinese malay sections there was a huge station that had many desserts displayed when we could help ourselves food quality was definitely good here and of cos very fresh the chefs cooks cooked the food right there and served them straight to the stations my friend has a small appetite so my brother and i would take a little of everything for her to try i could not remember how much was the lunch buffet since my mom was the one paying for all five of us just know weekend buffet lunch includes free flow of juices while buffet dinner does not the restaurant is entrance was kind of in a chaos when the staff started letting patrons with reservations to enter for lunch i believe that chaos could be eliminated with better procedure of how to get over a dozen of people to enter the restaurant at about the same time overall a very good place to try out almost all the local singapore food in just one place,Positive
straitskitchen,everything is halal halal halal first hotel manger mike took excellent care of us highly recommend staying here food buffet we did all  on different days breakfast lunch and dinner make reservations this place gets busy and i can see why prices may seem high but comparable to other hotel buffets the choices are in abundance malaysian singaporean indian indonesian and more try everything it is all good staff excellent this is now my  buffet spot is the world you cannot beat its variety quality service if i could give  stars i would excellent keep it up will be back in a few months,Positive
straitskitchen,yes yes and more yes we all know hotel restaurants are not usually the greatest but this place was so good i went back multiple times by choice my first experience was buffet breakfast the morning after i arrived since i was staying at the hotel i figured it would be easy the spread was awesome i started with fried rice and dim sum this was my fave it was so good i had to go back for more there were traditional western options such as pancakes waffles with various toppings nutella as well as a chef making made to order omelettes with plenty of topping options another area had fresh fruit and fresh juices lunch was great so many options to choose from my favorites were the indian food and the laksa soup station i would never had laksa so i had no expectations i was pleasantly surprised you have the option to make it as spicy or as mild as you wish the noodles prawn the broth all so delicious do not skip the dessert station the traditional singapore treats were beautifully packaged i indulged without taking a picture but the rainbow coconut delicacy was yummy try to save room for the coconut and lychee sorbet if you like ice cream great food great service you cannot go wrong with straitskitchen,Positive
straitskitchen,a bit of everything you would want to try in singapore especially if you are from the west variety superb setting air conditioning and ultra clean and warm ambience great tasting food and so colorful nice selection of fruits and desserts too yes it is never cheap but on a short trip if you want to try the best taste of singapore i would opt for this make sure you book way in advance if you do not want to miss out on this tasty treat,Positive
straitskitchen,great place to get your local food fix in an air conditioned place at a hotel restaurant price you get the same type of environment in an air conditioned food court minus the good plates removal service something you can never get at a food court and the expatriate crowd again cannot get at the food court the food counters serving different type of local food indian chinese malay drinks and desserts the quality is just above average of any food court really nothing special you get nasi lemak chicken rice wonton noodle poppiah ice kachang chendol u get the idea there are other places where you can get better local food but this place ups by having them all in one place,Negative
straitskitchen,i still think straits kitchen halal restaurant is a good introduction to local food albeit in an upscale and more comfortable setting with service you get to try the various singapore ethnic cuisines in one area peranakan straits chinese chinese malay and indian the indian food is always the favorite as the dishes are well executed the others are also good though not as good as what you can get in some well known hawker stalls the ayam buah keluak was a bit of a disappointment as the buah kelauk paste was mixed into the gravy the fun was in digging out the minced meat nutty paste from the shell though the satay was good though the peanut sauce was on the sweet side chicken would be more tender than the beef or mutton the desserts are also local fares with nonya kuehs ice kachang and chendol as staples the ice cream and sorbets are also tropical fruit based durian and coconut ice cream anyone lychee or mango sorbet i like the horlicks ice cream which is creamy and malty the not so good thing about a local food buffet is that you cannot really try everything as almost all the dishes are very rich with coconut and carb based rice and noodles,Positive
straitskitchen,offers a wide variety of items for buffet lunch and dinner all from hahal certified open kitchens menu highlights include chinese indian and malay specialties such as laksa butter chicken beef rendang carrot cake hainanese chicken rice and steamed popiah excellent quality and diversity see photos see the reviews from mark d glenn h azira a melissa z who all tell it spot on,Positive
straitskitchen,breakfast without sausage is not breakfast at all i just do not get why they are doing this regardless the breakfast was well executed there was a wide selection although no sausage and i felt like my bases were properly covered that said how about a separate table for us sausage lovers i was a bit worried about combining various regional spices but it worked and my stomach was content whether said breakfast warrants such high prices is up to you but some pay for ac and convenience,Negative
straitskitchen,to be fair i came later in the evening about  minutes before close but service and food quality was very poor for the price of  i enjoyed some lukewarm food on sticky buffet dishes thankfully i was not parched because no water provided staff seemed far more focused on clearing out the restaurant than serving the patrons,Negative
straitskitchen,absolutely loved straitskitchen in singapore i was staying in singapore for  nights and actually dined here twice for dinner i made a reservation online and had first seating for both nights weekend weekday take a walk around the contemporary dining area and you will find yourself surrounded by food action stations malay indian chinese cuisines all cooked by chefs from those regions beef rendang chicken beef mutton satay chili crab or black pepper crab laksa and various asian noodles popiah prata and all the indian curries you could possibly eat i am really not good with words so maybe my pictures can help describe my dining experience at straitskitchen hours are from    pm depending on the day cost is about  usd,Positive
straitskitchen,antony bordain put this place on foodie is map if you only have  hours in singapore then this place will make sense to you we had  days and on the last day before departure we had lunch here nearly  we tried all the things we had access to at the maxwell hawker market and it was just mediocre,Negative
straitskitchen,great singapore local halal food all in one spot the grand hyatt serves malay chinese and indian food that is local to singapore quality is great and everything is fresh make sure to bring your appetite i have tried the famous hawker centers and other venues and this hotel is definitely on par with them local favorites like satay laksa spicy crab chicken rice and so much more,Positive
straitskitchen,do you know that there is an awesome sichuan noodles limited edition fair going on with the buffet here till  dec if you think that sichuan noodles is all about spicy minced meat paste on top of dry dan dan noodles then you got to try the authentic version at chinese kitchen of halal certified buffet restaurant straits kitchen chef patrick pan from xi an china celebrates the culinary heritage of his roots by introducing two types of sichuan noodles that would definitely transform the stereotypical image of sichuan cuisine dan dan mian aka peddler is noodlestaking a subtle approach to the dan dan mian chef pan whips out a soupy version that is blended with peanut paste which gives it a very pleasant aroma dip the spoon into the sea of the reddish broth without the wavy noodles and one will haul up a mound of dried peppercorn sesame seeds spring onions all the necessary ingredients that makes this bowl particularly rich and flavour duck contrary to its fiery outlooks the noodles only carries a faint fugitive heat stimulating my craving for some chilli padi dao xiao mian knife shaved noodles meanwhile i was fully impressed by how chef pan managed to allow the flavors of the components cumin star anise homemade sichuan chilli oil peppercorns japanese leeks and chinese parsley to shine through without overpowering one another pairing this clean broth with pleasantly chewy knife shaved noodles makes for a surprisingly refreshingly bite a less herby and salty version of a vietnam beef pho with some ridiculously soft  hour slowed braised australian beef shank i would have slurped down the two bowls of msg free broth if there were not so many other temptations around given that this sichuan promotion is part of the weekday buffet at straits kitchen one has no reason to leave without trying all the uniquely singaporean dishes that are constantly whipped out from the theatrical show kitchens,Positive
straitskitchen,the food is consistently very good and the service is always outstanding the breakfast buffet is the best i have experienced the dinner buffets are also excellent the dinner buffets are set up with several different exposed kitchen areas each has different kinds of food they have indian food in one area malaysian in another with very good satay and beef rendang etc the atmosphere and attire is casual i highly recommend both breakfast and dinner,Positive
straitskitchen,it had been many years since i would been here but on a recent trip to singapore my boss invited me to join him and his wife for dinner at straitskitchen they must be regulars because the managers came by to greet them and personally seated us i am not used to that kind of attention but i must say it is very nice i enjoy hawker centers and kopitiams in singapore the wide variety of food and good prices are the draw for me well at straitskitchen they certainly have the wide variety everything from top notch hokkien fried mee to chicken rice to chili crab and even roti prata is here to enjoy and everything i sampled was delicious needless to say the service was excellent not just because my host knew the management it seemed everyone received top notch service it is a bit pricey even for a buffet but a worthwhile splurge imo this is a great place to makan in singapore,Positive
straitskitchen,fantastic restaurant with excellent selection of asian cuisine ambiance and service are superb too not the best buffet i had in my life but it is a close second,Positive
straitskitchen,this is where i would bring international friends to try local food the spread is fantastic they have peranakan food indian food chinese zhi char hawker style food popiah kueh pie tee local desserts like mee jiang kueh orh nee yam taro paste pulut hitam kueh and their chicken rice is hands down the best i have had in singapore i have been coming here for years and perhaps my only gripe is that they have not changed the spread so i am a little tired of it  stars all around nonetheless,Positive
straitskitchen,straitskitchen is at the grand hyatt in singapore and i went for breakfast while staying at the hotel it is a buffet spread and they have a huge mix of items there for breakfast coming from a wide variety of regional origin including malay chinese indian and western american european plenty of fresh fruit and juices were available it was an interesting experience to eat breakfast foods from a variety of regions cultures and all prepared well the buffet food is also considered to be halal permissible under islamic law so there is no swine pork but with the variety of selection i did not miss having it at breakfast,Positive
straitskitchen,really amazing selection for brunch really encompasses a wide variety of food and is great for trying out different cuisines,Positive
straitskitchen,my favorite restaurant in singapore for breakfast brunch i have repeatedly recommended it to anyone i know who goes is going to singapore i had the pleasure of staying at the grand hyatt on more than a few occasions in singapore and was stunned to see this restaurant located within this beautiful business travel friendly hotel the reason awesome food from many locations china malaysia india and indonesia all freshly prepared at various stations with fresh pressed tropical and standard juices making this one of the most wonderful breakfast buffet choices i have ever encountered anywhere ok maybe not every single dish was noteworthy the chinese dishes come to mind as not my favorites but with so much to choose from from standard us breakfast fare to the more exotic asian blends the lesser dishes fade into the background this is probably not inexpensive i was traveling on business per diem but the experience was great and was every time i went which was  times so if you are fortunate to visit this grand hyatt you owe it to yourself to visit straitskitchen at least once i am pretty certain you will not regret it oh and the coffee is good too,Positive
straitskitchen,amazingly average i can only write from an american point of view but nothing wow would me i wish we had just gone back to little india i tried  or so things the butter chicken was so so the deserts all lacked sugar my friend literally gagged on a green and white rice desert avoid this place if you are a westerner the diet coke was the best part of the meal we should have gone straits past this one,Negative
straitskitchen,as i have said in a previous review i am not a big fan of buffets but as buffets go i did enjoy this one i want to start with the juice bar rocks lots of great options i had three plates of food dessert the first was a plate of local favorites these were all flavorful tinyurl com dwocothe second was indian food this was also very good while it was not as good as going to a really good indian restaurant it was as good as many indian buffets tinyurl com jlfethe last plate was some very tasty duck tinyurl com rbtepi also had a local dessert that seemed kind of like a custard with a mollases like sauce i have heard the name of the sauce but i can not currently remember it through out the meal the staff was very attentive the room is nice but has a hey this is a buffet look and feel overall i thought this was a good buffet the food was consistently good there was lots of variety the service was very consistent the room is comfortable,Positive
straitskitchen,this is a tough one on the one hand it is a pretty nice place for tourists who would like to try local food also certified halal but prefer a comfortable hotel environment vs going out to a hawker centre tis a pity for locals i think there is really no point the food is actually pretty good with lots of variety but you can get just as good or better in many coffeeshops or hawker centres it is also pricey for what you get one big misstep in my opinion is that the buffet does not come with any drinks at all not even a measly teh or kopi which i feel is essential for complete one is local food experience after all that to pay extra for a teh or kopi come on,Positive
straitskitchen,i came here with a few coworkers for an introduction to classic singaporean dishes without the hawker stall ambiance and let is just say i was pretty impressed each counter was full of amazing and delicious surprises so making a few rounds was a must i have to say though the tom yum soup was the best i have ever had it was quite spicy but the bold flavors were quite addicting and i could not stop myself from grabbing seconds,Positive
straitskitchen,if you want to taste a wide variety of local food in a comfortable and clean environment straits kitchen is the place to head to different food sections malay chinese indian desserts drinks the quality of cooking is pretty good across the board with dishes ranging from roasted duck chicken rice otah tandoori freshly made naans etc the durian and horlicks icecream flavours are pretty good walk around and try as much as you can full price of  per person about  including tax will seem steep compared to eating these dishes in hawker centres but the environment robust flavours and good service makes up for it it is definitely a great place for bringing visitors who want to have a sampling of a wide variety of dishes and you can walk off the huge meal by shopping around orchard road afterwards,Positive
straitskitchen,the assortment on the menu is phenomenal especially if you enjoy chinese malay and indian cuisine like i do love this place and need to get back there again,Positive
straitskitchen,i had breakfast at the straits kitchen in the grand hyatt singapore during my stay at the hotel and must say that they left a good impression their buffet was fairly extensive including but not limited to chinese indian and western options including an egg station meats fruits pastries breads and more the service was wonderful the host remembered our room number on day two and my husband had not even gotten it down yet their service was prompt and everyone was friendly we never ran in to a wait nor was the restaurant ever so crowded that it was hard to walk it is hard to beat the coffee which is of a richer french press style delicious the ambiance was excellent with beautiful architectural elements warm lighting and cozy tables the restaurant had a lot of seating yet still felt very intimate,Positive
straitskitchen,not really an establishment for locals straits kitchen is more suitable for tourists that want to give local food a try and in a clean environment there is a wide selection of local fare on offer in different food stations in a market like setting for us singaporeans you could almost call in a high class food court the atmosphere in here is always bustling and there is plenty of space to sit about should you want some privacy from the other diners that said should you have a sudden craving for some local fare and are reluctant to travel to the particular stall you will be pleased to know that all the fare on offer here are almost equal to the real deal so its not just for foreign visitors,Positive
straitskitchen,so very disappointed booked xmas lunch buffet and even though a large selection of food i was looking forward to a buffet of prawns they were there alright but they could not be shelled because they were obviously frozen and then brought out for today they were soggy and putrid as were the screaming kids who is parents simply let them run a muck right next to us all i wanted to do was chuck my soggy prawn heads at them defiantly not worth the  per head this restaurant let is down the f b department of the hotel,Negative
straitskitchen,i was there a couple of weeks ago on a monday with the wife and our baby boy to celebrate my birthday was a spur of the moment thing called in just an hour before dinner buffet started and reserved a table the guy on the phone even said that they would give me a complimentary slice of cake for my birthday sweet i said so we got there a couple of minutes too early so waited for a little while got seated staff were courteous asked for water because alcohol in singapore is exorbitant what more at a swanky place like hyatt in the end we did not eat too much unlike locals who starve themselves before buffet meals and stack up on the crabs d and i paid sg  all in tax and tips about us  for two person was it worth it not exactly as a local not exactly one but having spent my childhood in malaysia and a couple of years in singapore i would say no mainly because there are many great food options littered all around the country for a small fraction of the price however that is also the problem the best dish options i benchmarked against the buffet options otak biryani gado popiah chili crab are literally found at different locations in singapore if you are looking for decent not best or even amazing local fare under one roof in a very convenient location orchard in a comfortable airconditioned restaurant this is your place and yes this would be a good choice for a foreigner without the luxury of time to explore for real kickass local food in singapore if one had time one should even journey up north to malaysia for tastier singaporean malaysian food yeah almost all singaporeans agree that food in malaysia are generally way better than in singapore,Positive
straitskitchen,i got to singapore and this was the first place i ate i was amazed by the variety and options by far some of the most delicious hainanese chicken along with a handful of authentic singaporean deserts,Positive
straitskitchen,our favorite restaurant in singapore located in the grand hyatt on orchard road straits kitchen is a buffet that showcases the best of singapore is local fare with its many different live cooking stations each cooking station is directly behind the serving counters and this has definitely ensured freshly cooked food with almost every dish they prepare malay peranakan specialties including ayam buah keluak chicken cooked with indonesia black nuts beef rendang etc satay station this was one of the busiest stations with freshly flame grilled marinated chicken beef and mutton satays noodle station with freshly cooked made to order prawn mee soup laksa etc bbq chicken and the beloved local dish hainanese chicken chinese fare including the singaporean favorite carrot cake freshly cooked from the wok and served directly to patrons the chinese station also had local favorite chili crab tasty popiah station one of my personal favorites feel free to custom make it the way you like e g more sauce more radish less peanuts etc salad station not your typical boring salads but they feature indian salads thai salads with green mango etc they also have made to order chinese rojak part of the indian station they have roti prata naan etc made on the spot indian station featuring a myriad of curries tandoori meats etc whenever i think about the food at this station i have major cravings to go to straits kitchen,Positive
straitskitchen,one useful tip when you go there do not take too much rice otherwise you will feel full faster and wo not get to taste the rest of the cuisines available straits kitchen is one stop where you can sample almost all local dishes one might argue that it is better to head to some hawker centre but hey wait till you get here yes prices are steep but you get big prawns and crabs it is also classy air conditioned and does not have the hawker smell lingering around efficient and observant staff clear plates and replenish cutlery while you get a fresh helping of other items it is not somewhere you would want to head to for a quiet meal though it is mainly families who dine there together the restaurant is always busy so it is not a bad idea to make a reservation before you actually go down it saves precious time and avoids disappointment,Positive
straitskitchen,ohhhhmyyyygoddddd went here for dinner and was literally in wonderland figuratively ted mosby i do not have enough capital letters for this place a dozen stations with seafood salad meat noodles juice bar a smorgasbord of desserts ugh take me back you need to go here it is worth every penny,Positive
straitskitchen,i generally do not go for buffets which feature local food this is because local street food is so inexpensive and usually very much better however the food here is really really good i hear they actually bothered to get proper hawkers to make their food and it shows the roasted meat section is one such example the chicken rice and the chilli can match up to any in a hawker center the have a amazing tandoori spread with all kinds of wonderful grilled meat the dessert spread is also good last year during ramadan they invited an egyptian dessert chef to do the pastries absolutely amazing overall this is a place i would take my foreigner friends as an introduction to local food in a comfortable airconditioned comfort,Positive
straitskitchen,a must whenever i go to singapore there is better hawker food at individual stalls but it is impossible to go to each one individually one can get almost every dish here the air conditioning is a big bonus i wish they had fishballs make sure to have the durian ice cream it is the best,Positive
straitskitchen,the straits kitchen is one of the best places to get excellent singaporean chinese and indian cuisine in an air conditioned environment with grand hyatt level service you can probably get just as good if not better food at an outdoor hawker centre and the price would be more reasonable but to do that you would have to be a true local insider to know where to go and what to order the restaurant is buffet style which means a lot of bustle noise etc producing a good vibe if you are with a large group of friends i would definitely go again,Positive
straitskitchen,this is an awesome place to go for some local food in a comfortable and classy ambience located in the hyatt hotel in orchard this restaurant is completely local and only a buffet restaurant the food is amazing indian malay and chinese and the best of the three cuisines all the food is made fresh and right in front of you the have a noodle station freshly made prata and tandoori and lots of local desserts as well they even have authentic local drinks like iced milo and sugarcane all of course more expensive than hawker stalls haha but its a very nice restaurant with great service and very good food,Positive
straitskitchen,i guess the name gave it away a true local food fare like no other the straits kitchen offers an upscale local buffet spread with everything from chicken rice to indian crab curry best of all fresh fruit juices are included perfect for this tropical dining experience among the local flavours offered the indian buffet spread offers a rich selection of seafood based curries such as crab fish and prawns the prawns used are not your regular prawns but instead they are huge succulent king prawns that soak up flavour well not in the mood for prawns dive into the crab curry instead the sweet flower crabs are a perfect complement to the array of spices in the curry one thing that does not make sense to me though is kopi and teh are an additional charge and do not come cheap at the hyatt book early if you are planning on visiting over the weekend,Positive
straitskitchen,nice atmosphere decor and very interesting buffet concept with many different stations food is overall very good but service is notoriously unattentive for an upscale place but bring some patience or a fog horn and enjoy a nice tour of the asian cuisine,Positive
long-beach-seafood,i have three words for you singapore chili crab our hotel recommended this spot so off we went late on a sunday night have no fear this spot is open til  am daily the menu is absolutely massive with delicacies from the ocean but we came here for one thing famous chili mud crabs long beach is also known for black pepper crabs too but we wanted to try this national delicacy on our last night the crab is   kilos and came in a vat of chili sauce piping hot we also got some fried buns for dipping on the side we were provided wet naps and a bowl of calamansi water to dip our fingers but luckily were seated by a washing station with soap and paper towels also i visited that station quite a bit our server and other staff were hilarious it was a fun atmosphere eric r asked for jumbo water glasses and that is the competitor is name so he got a hard time in a funny way and it was amusing the staff put a big pitcher of water on a saucer on our table to appease him we also got some tiger beer pints we sat outside because the inside felt cold at the entry way our hotel told us this is a very casual spot and we saw a variety of people dressed from super casual like us who came from the zoo to fancily dressed people one look at the vat of chili crab would explain why you do not want to be dressed up for this experience i saw some folks inside wearing bibs but we just went for it and got splattered the crab cracker tool was very slippery because we could not keep it from getting wet but it was effective eric r never likes working for food he said he prefers not to shell shrimp crack crab or crawfish or even going to korean bbq shabu shabu and hot pot are exceptions apparently but he thought this was definitely worth the effort our noses were running and our hands were messy but our bellies were happy and full this was really fun be aware that while this is a casual place there is a huge menu of abalone and other fancy fishes and set menus priced up to  sgd per person whoa crabs are market price but one order was plenty for two probably just a bit too much for us so we did not get appetizers or sides beyond the fried buns for dipping enjoy,Positive
long-beach-seafood,i had really mixed feelings about trying this place because the reviews i read were all over the place i think my hesitation came from the many reviews that mentioned how they leave you an appetizer as if it is complimentary but then charge you for it or that if you use the wet naps on the table you will be charged as well not sure if this is a normal singapore thing as we did not go to any other actual restaurants mostly stuck with the hawker stands or if this is purely a tourist trap but nevertheless we trekked on over to try the famous singapore chili crab it was odd that when we walked up that asked what country we were from they guessed us not sure what that has to do with anything but i did not really like that are they checking to see if we are tourists we read about the appetizer and wet naps we were hungry so we ate the peanut appetizers knowing we would be charged i had brought along my own wet naps a plenty so we did not use theirs we ordered chili crab and  mantou for the two of us that was the perfect amount of food it was a little scary since they do not really have the market price per crab listed and you do not know what size crab they are going to pick you you are hope is in the luck of the draw the flavor of the chili crab was not spicy at all to me the sauce was a little sweet it really was not what i was expecting but overall still pretty good dipping the mantou in the sauce is a must as there is a ton of sauce we literally did not order any other food just the crab  mantous and  drinks our overall total was  the crab itself was  we also got charged  for tidbits aka the seemingly complimentary non complimentary peanut appetizers there was a service charge added and gst not sure what the service charge is for what i also really did not like is that when they brought the check back after they charged the card the guy stood there waiting for us to sign the receipt from what i have read you do not need to add tip in singapore but here there was a tip line and you know we are from the us so we are used to tipping but even though i knew we did not need to tip the guy hovering there made me feel really pressured and i was not sure whether i needed to tip or not so we did and i ended up regretting it afterwards so no you do not need to tip despite their pressure and hovering do not eat the appetizers and bring your own napkins wet naps i am not sure i would come here again i would probably like to try chili crab somewhere else i do wish i would have had a taste of of the black pepper crab though perhaps another time another place,Negative
long-beach-seafood,looking for seafood look no further long beach seafood is the original creator of the black pepper crab for a table of four and a baby we went with the  course menu for four for sgd this menu started off with the salted egg prawns this was very tasty that i wanted to eat more of the seasoning as it goes really well with the prawns next up was the canadian dungeoness crab looks black all over because of the black pepper seasoning so yummy and a bit peppery hot the steamed fish came out and it also was quite soft and flavorful if you are not into fish then i would skip this the fujin qin long vegetables was also a dish that was a non stop eating for me the is oup with the veggies was so good too i could eat this forever the silver fish and sprouts rice came up next and we ate a little because we were so full last but not least was the lime lemongrass aloe jelly dessert it was cool to the mouth on a humid night all in all this was a last good dinner for the trip should have came here to begin with so we could eat it again and again,Positive
long-beach-seafood,i must admit that the only reason why i wanted to go to singapore was for the food particularly singaporean chili crab because nowhere else can i get this thick flavorful pot of meaty crab my friend who frequents singapore told me we should go here and so we did i decided to wear a white top and shorts because it was pretty hot and humid even in december in sg if you are reading this do not make the same mistake we got there at  pm and there were only  tables that were occupied and the hostess was still deliberating if they had a table for us ummm the place is practically empty she told us she can give us a table but we have to be done by pm wtf you should tell your server and kitchen staff to hurry up then we were not even offered bibs after placing our order we got chili crab fried mantou and tofu we got to cracking the crab and sure enough it landed on my white top and my legs then that is when they gave us bibs too late for that the food is good the mantou was good for soaking up the sauce there are hundreds of seafood restaurants in sg that serve chili crabs go there,Negative
long-beach-seafood,i think this place is better than no sign board and jumbo combined the staff are amazing and very attentive the place is huge and if you have a large party as we did you can get a private room most importantly the chili crab is delicious we also had garlic butter crab and my favorite black pepper crab and both of those two are equally delicious bring the family here for dinner it will not disappoint,Positive
long-beach-seafood,service is attentive black pepper crab is delicious along with other items ordered this place is consistent and you can be we will assure food is best quality stars deducted as they sneaked an appetizer on the table we thought it was complimentary but to our surprise they left it there as a trick for us to pay for it shame beware everyone if it is on the table but you did not order it return or ask server before touching it if in doubt do not touch at all they also did it with the wet wipes referring to other reviews we did not use the wrapped wet wipes however they went ahead and place two wet wipes on a plate on our table i went ahead and fell for it and used it this was also charged on bill food is already expensive not sure why they have to go out of their way with these little schemes and tricks to add little change on the bill i think that is tacky i will check out a diff seafood place next time i am in town,Negative
long-beach-seafood,chili crab is to die for it is amazing i can just take shower in that sauce it was so good and amazing blacked pepper crab was okay i think chili crab was must have if you must choose i also had some beef dish and noodle but i was just so mesmerized by chili crab i almost forgot yes they were as good but chili crab must have chili crab location is closed to a mall like everything else in singapore free parking right by waiters were very friendly and attentive,Positive
long-beach-seafood,i came to long beach seafood with my family friends and had a delicious seafood experience in particular the chilli crab was amazing the meat was juicy and the sauce was very flavorful with a strong but not overpowering spicy chilli taste the cereal shrimp was another highlight i loved the crispiness of the shrimp and how they incorporated salty egg yolk the accompanying crunchy cereal would really satisfy people who like fried stuff or intense flavors i also really enjoyed the mini squid i forgot what it was called specifically but the mini squid was lightly fried and had a dark brown sauce over it it again was crunchy and the sauce was slightly salty but had great flavor i also had their veggies and other dishes which were all pretty good the restaurant was big but we still made a reservation to be safe everyone was really nice and greeted us with great smiles if i were back in singapore i would def come back,Positive
long-beach-seafood,it is all about fingering the crabs baby you cannot say you have been to singapore if you have not tried their amazing seafood more specifically the iconic singapore chili crab a perfectly steamed from live mud crab samoan crab to hawaii yeeps claws the size of your hand shell cracked then basted in a fresh chili sauce fragrant herbs a touch of sugar and thickened by eggs messy to eat wear your bib or be prepared to toss your shirt but so tasty the warming but not thermonuclear chili flavor draws out the natural sweetness of the crab the meat itself very firm in texture closer to lobster that crab a side of montou deep fried sweet buns the perfect accompaniment to mop up the delicious sauce heck they even provide a bowl and spoon so you do not let any of the delicious sauce go to waste it is filled with the female crab eggs after all do not pass on the black pepper crab invented by long beach seafood outstanding the same mud crab perfectly steamed shells cracked but this time sauted in very finely ground copious quantities of black pepper the dry roasted pepper corns very spicy aromatic with no bitter or acrid flavors it works even better at bringing out the sweetness of the crab outstanding add a few additional fresh seafood dishes to round out the meal the razor clam ordered by the piece steamed in a gentle soy garlic sauce and topped with vermicelli and crispy garlic is exceptional the clams well cleaned and perfectly cooked display and oceanic sweetness and texture of an abalone more than a clam crunchy deep fried prawns cooked from live with freshly fried garlic also amazing the restaurant knows how to tease the sweetness out of the best seafood this prawn dish can be ordered with or without the shell note crab dishes can be done with the traditional mud crab australian crystal crab or alaskan king crab though why mess with tradition market price by the kilo  kg minimum what to drink tiger beer of course service is extremely efficient but always with a smile it is surprising that there are no accidents in the hectic dining room with servers rushing between tables advance booking required at all locations use the website indoor and outdoor seating despite the heat dine outdoors so the food does not cool too quickly although the food sounds humble seafood is rarely inexpensive this dinner for two inclusive of four beers tax and service exceeded  sgd it was worth every penny i truly cannot wait to get back to fingering one of my favorite crabs of all time,Positive
long-beach-seafood,crabs let is be real i do not care for seafood but if you brought me back to long beach i will eat almost anything you put in front of me my cousin brought us here for singapore is famous chili crab no joke that dish is legit however this place serves a lot of different carb dishes like the black pepper crab good and the white pepper crab the best imo they had other delicious dishes here but the most memorable were these three crabs you can also request the server to table side remove the shell for you what it is obviously less messy to eat and more enjoyable so if you are on that cra tour then swing by here and try their crabs i am telling you it is been a few months and those crabs are still very memorable for me,Positive
long-beach-seafood,fantastic seafood selection i would go straight for the curry crab not a huge fan of shellfish but man the sauce dipped in the soft bread impeccable one of the most delightful food experiences i have had,Positive
long-beach-seafood,im giving  stars for the pepper crab and service the other two which was deep fried baby squid was a total letdown together with the dried scallop fried rice the squid was overly sweet sprinkled with sesame seeds it was overly crunchy too felt like i am eating crackers the fried rice was super bland i had to finish most of the food as it cost us  to have  meals and dint wanna go to waste it was horrible food i thought jumbo seafood chili crab was bad we dint order chili crab here and the chili crab at jumbo was more like a ketchup crab than a real chili crab do not get me wrong their black pepper crab was good it was just the other  dishes killed my appetite and my tummy will never come back again oh yeah the crab was small for the price we paid,Negative
long-beach-seafood,long beach seafood at dempsey is a great place to sample singapore is variations of the crab dish i had their chance to taste black pepper salted egg and chilli crabs in addition to the crab beehoon although my favorite is the black pepper crab all variations were impeccable food is  stars the service at their dempsey location also deserves  stars the staff was attentive although we did not feel that we were being watched as soon as we needed something the staff appeared to our table the staff also offered to de shell the crabs the decor at the location was upscale the utensils were new and the table cloth clean long beach at dempsey offers a refined singaporean crab experience if you prefer a more casual atmosphere their long beach branch is not as formal while the food is as good,Positive
long-beach-seafood,this is my favorite place in singapore to get chilli crab mainly because they make each batch fresh and from scratch and the sauce is always rich satisfying and with a nice balance between sweet spicy sour and savory if you are lucky they will have enormous crabs available which are the absolute best they cost a pretty penny but it is so worth it when you can dunk that giant claw in all the delicious chilli crab sauce the sauce is so good i eat it with everything the crab additional prawns that i order on the side mantou steamed or fried buns i prefer steamed mee goreng if there is a lot leftover i even take it home to toss with pasta the next day they do good seafood overall i have had good experiences with their steamed clams bamboo clams or pacific clams prawns the drunken or steamed ones are my favorite baby squid fried in a sweet black sauce that i love geoduck expensive but yummy they also have some good vegetable sides and i really like the mee goreng especially when you can eat the mee goreng with the remaining chilli crab sauce yum because i do not eat crabs in any other style i consistently come back just for the chilli crabs which are truly the best thing available here i have had chilli crab in many other restaurants and none of them come close to what long beach offers at dempsey i have found that their standards can be a little inconsistent in other outlets but dempsey has always been consistently delicious service is great too you can get plastic gloves and bibs to protect your clothes and hands when handling all that seafood it just makes the entire experience more pleasant and it is also great when you do not go home with chilli crab sauce all over your top,Positive
long-beach-seafood,wow the black pepper sauce is unreal get the bread to soak it up the chili sauce is good as well be hands down the black pepper is more flavorful the scottish clams are fantastic too for desert the rose jelly is just sweet enough to not over power you as for the staff fantastic lively funny and accommodating as well as highly attentive a great place for a relaxed low stress dinner experience,Positive
long-beach-seafood,food was terrific chilli crab and black pepper crab were delicious totally worth going did not care for the fried squid appetiser tasted like overly deep friend something but nothing like squid everything else was terrific,Negative
long-beach-seafood,not worth it the service is bad and the ambience is worse spending  for two people in this setting leaves me uncomfortable the crab is good but not great many people had told me to come here instead of jumbo seafood and i think that was the wrong call certainly would not return,Negative
long-beach-seafood,must go your life is not complete without going to long beach seafood when you are in singapore my husband and i were skeptical about going out of the way for this restaurant we were staying at the mandarin oriental in marina bay getting to dempsey hill was a hassle and there are so many other good food options closer to us still a local coworker insisted that we try long beach seafood and thus the journey to great food began public transit was a hassle we took the green line on the mrt train to commonwealth then took the  bus to opp pierce from there we walked across a pedestrian bridge across a lawn up a hill thru a construction zone passed several parking areas and voila we finally arrived somehow we ended up in the back of the restaurant the really nice wait staff ushered us to the front whew instead of testing our luck at picking random things on the menu we went with a pre selected dinner menu the meal for  people cost  sgd which was about  usd razor clams had not been delivered as a result of bad weather so instead they gave us some other clams as substitutes but prepared the same way as the razor clams these were the best clams i have ever had the clams were stuffed with garlic glass noodles and clam meat there was also a light soy sauce that complimented the dish the savory dish was light flavorful and left you wishing for more up next was the leek flower blossom i never had this before but it was so very delicious the leek flower blossom was cooked but still had a nice crunch again it was a very light dish even though it appeared to be stir fried or sauted the main dish was the black pepper crab this was a life changing experience the black pepper sauce was thick flavorful and spicy it complimented the huge chucks of crab meat we dig out of the claws not only did was this finger licking good i almost kicked my plate clean i seriously had to go wash my hands and face after this yummy dish we also had the flat rice noodles with la la king sauce which was a thick gravy sauce with clams and topped with crispy friend wontons the flavor of this dish was very subtle and elegant lastly we had an amazing dessert of pudding with ice cream and a mango sauce no words could possibly describe light and yummy this dish was you will just have to go try it for yourself the wait staff was so very kind and attentive we never had to ask for anything bc they were always a step ahead of us our waiter even called a taxi for us to get back to our hotel the restaurant was also very clean the food restaurant standards in singapore should be commended,Positive
long-beach-seafood,wow this was awesome messy spicy crab but so worth it we drank wine but this is definitely a place you want to drink lots of cold beer service was great did not seem like a touristy place at all my only complaint is how expensive it is the crab and all the sides we had were great but i wish it could have been a more reasonable price oh well everything in sg is expensive i would go back,Positive
long-beach-seafood,we ordered the pepper crab chilli crab lobster shrimp each one was excellent but the pepper crab was exemplary want to come back to singapore just for that,Negative
long-beach-seafood,diners beware went last night to have a highly anticipated chili crab dinner based on yelp reviews and was so disappointed the chili crab was good but the other dishes on the value set menu were dudes especially the seasonal greens with dried scallop and crab i could not find any crab in the dish just egg white cooked to resemble crab and a few strands of dried scallop swimming in a cornstarch gloop the pan fried noodle la la king was just as deceptive about six tiny baby clam shells which only had  filled with clams again drowning in a heavy corn starched sauce consistency must be the restaurant is strong suit because the coconut jelly dessert was almost inedible non descript gelatin covered in coconut milk sprinkled with a few tapioca balls the evening started out bad when the waiter brought black pepper crab to my table after i ordered the chili crab basically he pleaded that he would have to pay for the mix up in dishes but after i insisted that i wanted the chili crab did he take back the black pepper not an enjoyable or relaxing meal when you feel you have to defend your menu selection and stand up for your rights only to realize that this is a tourist trap orchestrated from the beginning to maximize your check from the strategic placing of the non complimentary appetizer and wet wipes on your table i had to ask for napkins since they did not have any on the table another ploy to buy the wet wipes save your round trip taxi fare and  sgd value menu plus  small mantou a tiger beer and bottled water i was still yearning for good singaporean seafood after this horrible dining experience,Negative
long-beach-seafood,been coming here for more than a decade long beach has the best pepper crab hands down after eating and sampling pepper crabs round the island long beach really has the best tasting pepper crabs around this round we ordered white pepper alaskan snow crab the huge alaskan crabs were cooked to perfection in a buttery creamy pepper sauce the chilli crabs are tasty but i would recommend the pepper crabs other dishes tasted great but didnt taste as savory as their signature pepper crab which they invented i gave them  stars for their fantastic pepper crabs that never fails to satisfy,Positive
long-beach-seafood,everthing that i expected both chill and pepper crab were well done little on the expensive side,Positive
long-beach-seafood,try the chilli crab its gravy was on the sweet side perfect if downed with fried buns i was also impressed with their lala horfun you could taste the wok hay and they gave it a crispy twist try it,Positive
long-beach-seafood,ok so we are big crab fans ppq in sf by far is still our fav  thought the crab itself is awesome but very  a crab just not a big fan of the daises and pref is dry rub,Negative
long-beach-seafood,must visit resto in singapore the black pepper crab is a must try durian dessert or glutinous rice with ice cream as well,Positive
long-beach-seafood,dempsey is quite hard to get to if you do not have a car luckily my friend drove me here and the parking lot was completely full and hard to find a spot to park garlic steamed clam with fun see it reminds me of those good ones that i had in hk though it was not as good as hk but still decent black pepper crab very tasty good flavor i do not normally eat crabs but this one did not get me stomachache because the pepper warms up my stomach the crab is relatively easy to open and eat dessert with flames ice it is a special mango dessert from this shop i do not recall it was free of charge or we paid obviously i did not pay for the meal lol it was very sweet for me but nicely looking i tried jumbo seafood it was not nearly as good as this one,Negative
long-beach-seafood,the saying of you get what you pay for is very true some may find the price high we spent about  for a family if  but it is worth every penny the crab in any style is amazing as is every item on their comprehensive menu the service we found was excellent and worthy of a nice tip if in singapore i highly recommend visiting this establishment,Positive
long-beach-seafood,the best chilli crabs ever you need to make reservations beforehand to get a place during weekends and peak hours the staff is quite courteous and offer reasonable suggestions,Positive
long-beach-seafood,wow first time to have pepper crab and chili crab it wo not be the last the restaurant has an island vibe but is packed it would be best to have a reservation the food is outstanding the house standard is the pepper and the chili crab i would also highly recommend the shrimp for an appetizer it is lightly breaded and has an exquisite taste cannot wait to go back,Positive
long-beach-seafood,my friend and i came here because we had heard that the crab here is pretty amazing we ordered the chicken with fruit sauce as an appetizer and we also ordered chili crab and black pepper crab the chili crab came with some fried buns which complemented the chili crab nicely they added some texture and also helped cool us down when the chili got too spicy for us it rarely did though the chili in chili crab really has not seemed that spicy so far i loved the chili because it was so rich and creamy while my friend loved the taste of the black pepper we ended up devouring the crabs quickly thoroughly enjoying this meal we highly suggest this place if you are in town and looking for some chili or black pepper crab,Positive
long-beach-seafood,there is always this danger of one being an elitist i could just imagine how the skew of stars would change from an positive curve to a bell curve or even a negative curve however i guess i just become one when the price tag reaches a certain point after all being in business i always believe that paying a certain price comes with a certain expectation here at long beach singapore not california where the term usually conjures up memories i will have to be somewhat of an elitist after witnessing my aunt drop down a stash of cash to pay for a dinner welcoming my fiance to singapore so pepper crab originated here aye well i can believe that is the case as i continued to fight through the sweat pouring out them pores so that my tongue could continue it tonguegasmic tour of the seafood that is provided here yet thing is that was all that was the splendor this place had to provide freaking crabs everything else on the menu with the exception of the fried chicken which is not even seafood was bland and boring at best i wanted to say i hated everything else but let is be honest the aunt was showing much love to us and wanted to bring us the best as a show of love and welcome she definitely was a win this restaurant however was bordering on a fail eat pepper crab and tell the rest of the seafood choices to get a life yelp,Negative
long-beach-seafood,i did not think it was so expensive as for dollars mark the food is great and vegetables are cooked in nice way sea food is awesome should try and see,Positive
long-beach-seafood,brought  friends visiting from the states and shared the  set menu which included quite a few dishes more than enough food for  people we started with a live prawn dish with broccoli that was quite good and also some chicken wings who does not love deep fried chicken wings mmm the black pepper crab came out next and the table went silent with everyone enjoying the deliciousness we added a chili crab to our order so that we can get a taste of both and we all liked the black pepper crab better the veggie dish and noodles were quite good also rounded out with a dessert some kind of warm taro paste yum as newbies all dining here for the first time we did not know we could ask for bibs gloves and scissors for the crab when we saw the tables next to us with these awesome amenities we were very sad as we just did not know to ask the weird thing about this restaurant is they have pictures of scantily clad women on the napkin covers and menus which makes the place seem very cheap and sleazy i thought that was quite weird also weird are the beer girls when you order beer they pour for you these girls wear tiger outfits which consists of a very short one piece miniskirt dress thingy again makes the place feel cheap and weird and not a respectable restaurant i do not get it still the food was all around good enough to get  stars and not,Positive
long-beach-seafood,black pepper crab is all i need to say has become one of my top dinner choices the razor clams were also fantastic good service and cold beer on the expensive side for a dinner but i cannot wait for my next crab great quiet location for having a relaxing and enjoyable meal,Positive
long-beach-seafood,excellent service our waiter was always around paying attention when the glasses are empty if wet napkins are needed we ordered chilli crab and pepper crab chilli carb  mins to cook the chilli one was on a sweet side with thick gravy all  sets of crab legs were missing pepper crab came  mins after order was perfectly seasoned only one set of legs was present the crabs supposedly have to be  kg and above both of ours were under  kg each crab  dollars they charge   for every wet napkin you use and  dollars for peanuts offered as you sit down probably will check another place when we crave for crabs,Positive
long-beach-seafood,went here for a dinner with a group from work perfectly acceptable from that perspective got a nice private room ordered from one of the set menus with a million courses all of the food was good and served family style i will say the roast chicken was phenomenal the skin was super crispy like duck and the meat perfectly cooked i would not come here on my own looking for an authentic singaporean food experience though it is a tourist place,Positive
long-beach-seafood,not the best we tried a bunch of dishes listing them out and explaining why  fried shrimp with some type of lightly fried fish topping was okay the shrimp just did not have enough flavor i do not like overly flavored food so for me to want extra flavor means this was not done right  tofu with lightly fried fish toppings this dish was okay good balance between the sauce and the tofu was firm but soft at the same time  duck skip this dish it is dry and bland had to drown it in the sweet sauce to give it some flavor  steamed fish do not remember the type of fish but it was okay the fish was cooked well and flavored were a good mix  fried fish a little on the dry side but it was tasty  white pepper and black crab the white pepper ran was my favorite dish here it was smokey but not too smokey like the black pepper crab most of my friends like the black pepper crab though they liked the spicy smokiness  lo mein noodles with fish and squid i believe this dish was good has good balance of salty and sweet texture of the noodles were good firm but also soft  the fried buns these were so good they are plain but good at holding the flavors of whatever dish you liked the most by dipping them into their sauce would definitely order these  chili crab no bueno would not order the sauce was too sweet and tangy in a bad way tasted as though they removed it from a can and heated it up in the microwave shame that is the reason we went to this place  fried rice with little bits of fish you cannot see the fish but you can taste it this dish was good as well would definitely order  another fried rice dish with chunks of fish onions scallions and egg would skip this dish not good the combination of the ingredients and sauce did not work  the garlic clams too much garlic and clams were chewy not the best would skip  bok choi and mushroom soup gooey texture of the soup threw me off was not a fan overall would probably not go back unless i had to for some strange reason also not the friendliest staff either,Negative
long-beach-seafood,the most disappointing long beach location yet the restaurant seems run down and dirty and the service questionable i asked for paper napkins not the wet ones and the man returned with paper towels he rolled out from the bathroom wth this place sticks out like a sore thumb in midst the plethora of good classy restaurants in the dempsey area for seafood in the dempsey area go to the jumbo seafood instead,Negative
long-beach-seafood,had lunch here today and am not quite sure what to make of it i had an overnight stopover in singapore and have always heard that the chili crab is a must eat there were only a few tables filled at lunch time and the hostess quickly showed me to my table for  i probably made the mistake of telling the waiter it was my first time and asking for his assistance as the small crab he promised to select for me cost s  i had not asked about price either probably another mistake i also had two steamed buns   and made the mistake of snacking on the peanuts put on the table   and using a hand wipe   if they have napkins at this restaurant they must be hiding them somewhere throw in a tiger beer and a perrier and the whole thing came to s   wtf the chili crab was tasty but not as spicy as i had hoped i easily finished my meal and even contemplated a couple more buns as i was still somewhat hungry definitely the most expensive wine less lunch i have ever had i find the sneaky charges to be really tacky also,Positive
long-beach-seafood,i have been coming here with my boyfriend to only order chilli crab hyperventilating right now the deliiiiicous razor clams and steamed buns we needed no duck fish or whatnots just the chilli crab and its friends to go along with so first we ordered the razor clams as our appetizer it was so yummy it had glass noodles with finely diced garlic ontop the garlic was quite a lot which i like accompanied with the yummy sauce everything was just so mouth watering after that came along the chilli crab ta daaa it was so darn good the sauce is only a little spicy for me because i take spice pretty good so so savory we eat that with the steamed buns when the crab meat is all gone we tend to just keep eating by dipping the buns in the chilli crab sauce deffinitely will keep paying a visit hehe but i need to refrain myself for going every darn weekend since the chilli crab is such a high caloric food haha,Positive
long-beach-seafood,thumbs up for long beach great pepper crab razor clams lobster and vanilla clams brought my own wine to go with the spicy food they are pack every night for good reason i would come again,Positive
long-beach-seafood,crabs are what you come for here so get those if you get nothing else there are several long beach outlets all over singapore but we ended up here since it is located in the trendy dempsey area reservations are highly recommended since they are often packed for dinner seems like practically every day more so on the weekends we took the chance without reservations since we were there early and it was just the  of us they did have a table but also told us we might have to finish our dinner within an hour or so so what happens if we did not did not get to find out despite that initial hitch service was friendly and nice they offered to take our photos without asking yes i was being a tourist and the food arrived soon after we ordered one medium sized crab cooked in pepper sauce and another in chilli sauce came along with fried rice cannot recall the name but it has bits of otah in it pepper crab stir fried with finely ground black pepper sauce that gets into every nook and cranny of the crab good complex flavor with garlic and mild heat from the pepper chilli crab this is the highlight for me as the crab is swimming in the chilli sauce lacks the complexity of the pepper version but the eggy and mildly spicy sauce hits the spot drizzle this on rice or dip the fried bread rolls in the sauce either way i could live on this stuff great food and above average service but expect to pay for it total tab for the  crabs fried rice came to just over s  pretty pricey in my book but then again singapore ai not cheap,Positive
long-beach-seafood,been here numerous times whenever we want to introduce out of towners to chili crab we come here once we brought a friend to jumbo and were duly disappointed the branch on east coast is probably slightly better in terms of freshness but this one is much more convenient plus you can have a drink in one of the bars pubs at dempsey afterwards you have to order the fried mantou to go with the chili sauce soak it all up a friend took the remaining sauce home and made a nice pasta the next day in addition to the crab i would also recommend the crispy duck and the thai style steamed fish the duck especially is one of the best i have had anywhere crispy chewy meaty and packed with flavor i can gnaw on its bones service and ambience are so so and it is on the expensive side but still the best chili crab in singapore in my opinion,Positive
long-beach-seafood,i love this place ok decor ambiance can do better but the crab is great i love the black pepper crab and the sauce of the chilli crab i prefer this to jumbo especially with regards to the chilli crab i love the pitchers of beer nice with the crab,Positive
long-beach-seafood,this is the best place to taste pepper crab not one of outdoor experience is superb,Positive
long-beach-seafood,classic chain seafood restaurant now more accessible since it is near the city thus you see lots of business dining tables long beach claims that they invented the black pepper crab it is an overall crowd pleaser the rest of the classic seafood dishes are all available deep fried baby squids it was a tad too sweet the night we ate steamed bamboo clams with garlic and vermicelli fried mee goreng nice and spicy and if you are there with overseas guests they can also try lots of local desserts like durian pudding all set in a floating bowl of dry ice for added effect cheap thrill i know but it is tacky local plus free parking at dempsey tip if you prefer black pepper crab to chilli crab but like the chilli crab gravy for s  you can get a bowl of chilli crab gravy without the crab but the full works with runny egg etc that you dip with mantou best of both crab worlds,Positive
long-beach-seafood,first time here it was ok had the black pepper crab from jumbo earlier in the week and would choose them next time not quite as spicy here so if you do not like spicy then this could be a good place for you service was good in the beginning but it took  minutes to get my check in their defense it was very very busy by the time i was ready to leave so they were hustling to keep up with the large groups staff was very friendly and helpful,Negative
long-beach-seafood,i was so excited to try crab in singapore because they are well known for it we had their famous black pepper crab and although the smokey pepper flavor was unique there was nothing special about it we also tried their fried lobster which is decent but the other dishes were medicore at best we had high hopes for this restaurant given the great reviews but the whole meal was kinda of underwhelming like other reviewers mentioned the restaurant does nickel and dime you on wet napkins and other stuff the part that really irritated me was they charged us for an appetizer when they were they placed a small dish on the table but did not mention there was a charge to it most restaurants that usually place an item on the table as you sit down give you that item for free this place did not even tell us there was a charge for this tiny dish that other restaurants provide for free we spent over  dollars for two people but by far this was definitely not worth price for their  star food and one star service you could get the same crab at local hawker restaurants for less than half the price this place charges,Negative
long-beach-seafood,this place is all over tour sites for singapore so one would expect the staff to speak and comprehend english more accurately singapore is primary language is english now the food crab is quite tasty we had the chili crab and the black pepper crab more than enough for  people as mentioned before this place charges you for everything the peanuts the hand towels but not the bathroom remarkably the food is good but charging for every little thing coupled with the spotty english gives this place two stars,Positive
long-beach-seafood,in singapore on business trip one chinese three americans the black pepper crab is as good as everyone says it is very flavorful just the right amount of spicy for me they were friendly enough to break all the shell and serve it to us in easily edible pieces the roast chicken was well cooked the skin was just crispy and the meat was just juicy it was also easy for americans to eat and they loved it as the chinese in the group everything else we ordered was average broccoli with garlic sweet and sour prawn fried rice for the service and treatment for the delicious seafood  stars,Positive
long-beach-seafood,wow great eats we had a table of twelve two of which live here we let them order for all they did a great job pepper crab chili crab some other buttery type of crab prawns duck fish i think they may have ordered the menu lol fresh mango to end it it was a great night at a d lish restaurant wow,Positive
long-beach-seafood,visited again if even possible the food especially the black pepper crab is even better the manager david ng informed us that cnn had rated the crab one of the  foods you must eat in the world before you die totally agree it would be criminal to come to singapore and not experience this,Negative
long-beach-seafood,long beach has been around since god knows when and there is nothing negative about that i remember coming here many many times when i was younger for those huge raucous family dinners where we would occupy two tables and leave only after we have littered the tabletop with heaps of crab and prawn shells pretty standard chinese seafood fare here the thick chilli crab gravy is fantastically fragrant and a perfect dip for a deep fried mantou another dish i really like is the drunken prawns the preparation of the dish is a tad disturbing though they dump the live prawns into the broth in front of you and you may have to watch it shiver and jump in the throes of death not for the faint hearted another famous dish here is the black pepper crab but it is a little too sweet for my liking one thing that i have grown to appreciate about long beach is that it is such a typical chinese restaurant impatient and boisterous waitresses a dish of peanuts of a complimentary appetizer and dubious looking chinese tea that tastes pretty much just like hot water,Positive
long-beach-seafood,when i think of crabs especially chilli crabs there is only one place that comes to mind long beach seafood the name alone tells you what to expect and having been around for the longest time is one of the places you know you can trust to have a great time i have been here since young and the standards have always remained consistent bookings are essential if you want to sit indoors where there is air conditioning if not you will find the al fresco areas rather breezy as well it is not just their crabs that are awesome they also have other delicious items on the menu like bamboo clams fried duck hor fun with a very good wok hei mee goreng and the alaskan white pepper crab their desserts are rather good as well do be sure to try their durian pudding its one of the best they have but unfortunately it depends on your luck as they do not have it all the time,Positive
long-beach-seafood,this was the worst food experience i have had in singapore we ordered a live king crab at  a kilo when asked how we wanted it cooked we simply said steamed we were told no because it was not a house specialty and we are talked into a butter type sauce we also ordered some shrimp and some greens the crab came out smothered in sauce that made it very messy to eat that would not have been bad but the crab was so overcooked you had to scrape the meat out of the shell and it was mushy we told the manager that we were not satisfied so then he offered to replace with a steamed crab by that time we had been there an hour and no longer wanted to sit there after some meager compensation we still left with a  check an uneaten crab and very disappointed i will never go back and would never recommend this place to anyone go to jumbos,Negative
long-beach-seafood,one of my favorite places for seafood the steamed garoupa and pepper crab is really good if you find the black pepper crab too spicy go for the white pepper i would rate this restaurant higher if the service was better parking is also a problem,Positive
long-beach-seafood,i prefer long beach vivo and east coast location better than the jumbo is and no signboard restaurants for their chili and black pepper crabs service has gotten a lot friendlier over the years as well popular with locals and tourists for chili crabs i am just reviewing the crabs i have not a lot of the other items except for vegs soup etc usually go for the crabs,Positive
long-beach-seafood,the reported home of pepper crab one of my all time favorite dishes big noisy and un airconditioned cold tiger beer accompanies the outstanding food but be prepared for the price the simple food court atmosphere belies the high cost especially for the chile and pepper crabs which were about  apiece,Positive
long-beach-seafood,this location tends to attract a lot of tourists and for that reason i did not go there with the highest expectations but i had a very good time there the butter crab was absolutely delectable with soft sweet buttery finger licking lip smacking rich gooey goodness everywhere the razor clams are much bigger than i have gotten elsewhere on the island and were absolutely worth the premium price very fresh sweet tender yet with a good amount of chew and a great garlicky sauce the sea bass in thai sauce was average but not bad otak was pretty good tofu with house special sauce not a big standout but still popular with the table all in all a good meal,Positive
long-beach-seafood,outstanding in every way the service was attentive food was outstanding and setting was beautiful we had some all time great dishes razor clams steamed in garlic pepper crab and a soup with an amazing broth and fish ball fluffy and not dense dessert was coconut ice cream with mangos it was the perfect end of a great meal we were brought there by some friends who live in singapore they are foodies and we were appreciative,Positive
long-beach-seafood,the chili crab here is delicious i do not even remember what else i ate but i just remember drinking the chili crab sauce when we finished the crab if i had known it was completely made of lard i would have probably refrained,Negative
long-beach-seafood,long beach failed miserably today we were able to get an outside table at the last minute of cny eve however they served us frozen alaskan king crab the manager confirmed it and apologised but by no reasons should they have compromised quality in the interest of more business we have been coming here for over  years not looking forward to come back no more trust,Negative
chinatown,if you are itching to shop for knick knacks and cheap souvenirs this is the place to be everything you can think of is sold here the stalls outdoors have more interesting items in my opinion but most of them sell the same products so you can walk around and hunt for better deals some shop owners can get quite pushy but you just stand your ground or do not do any eye contact and keep walking you can easily spend hours browsing and it gets very hot in the middle of the day so either go in the morning or late in the afternoon also there is a lively restaurant strip which gets crowded in the evening but it is the right place to be when hunger strikes food looked amazing and the smell gets you salivating,Positive
chinatown,singapore is chinatown was an overwhelming assault on the senses mostly in a good way though for me once was enough i loved seeing all the colorful stalls and the insane amount of eclectic snacks and other food offerings that said it was pretty crowded around post work hours on a thursday as a tourist it was hard to walk past any restaurant without being called at by the hostess and most of the trinkets for sale looked like cheap junk also i learned quickly what durian smells like as it was absolutely everywhere that is a smell i do not want to get too close too ever again i would read that chinatown complex was a great option for dining but we walked into the super stuffy building did one lap and quickly made our exit back to the street i am the first to admit that i am a little high maintenance and this was not going to cut it for me i will just have to take everyone is word that it is a great spot for street food in summary glad i got to see singapore is chinatown definitely wo not need to revisit next time i am in singapore,Positive
chinatown,singapore is chinatown is very much like most of the other chinatown is all across the globe it is a bit contrived for those of us old enough to remember the original chinatown in singapore this one leaves at least me wishing for earlier times i am not saying that this is not a fun enough place to visit but you are not going to find much culture here and you should be prepared for what you will experience there are numerous tourist type shops in this chinatown and even a few people out on the street trying to sell you a custom made suit and stuff like that probably the high point of singapore is chinatown is the outdoor food stalls there you will find a lot of people cooking up a lot of food this is particularly a good place to visit and eat and drink in the evening when the colorful lights are on and people have come out to enjoy the relatively cooler air chinatown is definitely worth the visit just know what to expect,Positive
chinatown,when you want to go to chinatown singapore you have to tell the precise address of the location you want to drop off if you tell the taxis driver to drop you off at chinatown he will have no clue where to drop you because chinatown cover are is big and cross over several cross street most people visit the area at pagoda street and new bridge road from there you can walk to buddha tooth relic temple and to ann siang hill within the china town has  hawker centre i like the maxwells hawker centre chinatown has numerous shopping area it is up to you to search for it it has two hawker who has won the one star michelin definitely do not miss those there a bridge cross over new bridge road link both sections of the chinatown be prepared to walk a lot you can walk from chinatown mrt station to telok ayer mrt station in between you find a lot of great stuff,Positive
chinatown,china town for me used to be a place to shop when i started to coming to singapore on business almost  years ago cultural experience including food foot massage shopping was something i looked forward to price and quality at hawker centre used to be much better price is still good but not as good as i used to be i noticed same stuff was sold slightly cheaper elsewhere in singapore for touristy stuff they could be listing higher to allow price negotiation,Negative
chinatown,pretty cool chinatown with a couple of awesome food centres around including maxwell which is not to far there is a lot of restaurants shops and hostels hotels in the area at night or at least the nights i was there a lot of stalls open up at night and it gets pretty lively lots of things catering to tourists for sure but also some good eats stick around for the food skip all the shops,Positive
chinatown,chinatown is so close to maxwell food centre so it is nice to come here an walk off your food i came here so i can see where they filmed crazy rich asians the place gets crowded around lunch time but it was also raining when i went to it was a bit of a challenge trying to stay dry this is a tourist trap though there is a lot of shops here and also a history center the buildings themselves are pretty historical parking can be a bit hard so take the mrt instead,Positive
chinatown,chinatown in singapore is a must visit there are many things to do here many restaurants and malls two major metro lines intersect in chinatown which makes it easy to get to no matter where you are staying there is also the chinatown hawker as well as the chinatown street food,Positive
chinatown,what a wonderful historic part of singapore if you are ever in singapore you absolutely must come to chinatown to experience the unique flavors and multitude of cuisine options there are also in abundance of souvenirs and camera shops so you can shop to your heart is content chinatown is home to the world is first michelin star rated street stalls so be sure to find some of them in the hawker centers,Positive
chinatown,singapore is chinatown is pretty comprehensive ranging from abundance of souvenir booths to delicious eats to easy accessibility to nice decor there is something for everyone here given its popularity many tourists visit chinatown and it can be overly crowded luckily i went on a sunday morning when there was not much hustle and bustle i visited the famous michelin star rated restaurant hawker chan for chicken and got gelato afterwards at one of the booths easy to get to from chinatown as it is right off the subway station i got a good laugh seeing a sign posted no pda as that annoys children and elders is there really that much pda among couples in chinatown,Positive
chinatown,a place with a mixture of good and bad stores the best places to go for are the hawker centers the other places are meh for tourists like me,Positive
chinatown,fun to visit another chinatown in a big city not in china some interesting historical buildings tourist shops and many many restaurants guess what food is so cheap you can get entrees for  here and a drink to sip for  i had a kimchi fried rice and a lime drink definitely a good part of singapore to visit if you like chinatowns,Positive
chinatown,this area is a lot larger than i thought at first glance i thought it was just the one hawker center and some stalls then it just kept growing the more we walked the bigger it got some parts ranged from really cool to just okay for example i did not care much for the food street you always here about big cities like new york or tokyo because they are cities that never sleep well singapore sleeps and it goes to bed at exactly    pm that is just around the time where i am hungry for my second dinner but by that time most of the food street stalls are closing up even if you get there earlier than that certain stalls stop selling fruit drinks and desserts the cool part of chinatown is that it is more than just the touristy knick knack shops sure you can purchase anything with an owl on it here or some cheap tiger balm but there is also some mini malls and actual clothing stores around the area where you can pick up something more unique than an i heart singapore key chain but by far the coolest thing about this giant chinatown are the hawker centers i could eat there all day everyday lots of people lots of good energy,Positive
chinatown,chinatown is always bustling so much to see eat and buy the main objective for coming here was to find some fresh fruits i was in singapore during the end of november beginning of december so i could not find any durians at the local supermarket near my hotel the next best place was definitely chinatown since durians are not in season i paid  for a mao shan wang  which is reportedly the best it was so delicious and ultra custard like we also bought  bags of mangosteen each bag was around  pounds and it was only  a bag it is also nice to explore and view the historical buildings not only that but it is a walking distance to maxwell hawker center,Positive
chinatown,great area a very large and old chinatown with tons of stores and restaurants smith street is one huge food street featuring hawker or street food a lot of charm and always very busy,Positive
chinatown,one of my favourite parts of singapore its a great area to walk around do some shopping get a nice massage eat and get some clothes made at the moment it is decorated as cny is just around the corner and the streets are buzzing i love going to this area for excellent massage for cheap prices i had a foot reflexology for  mins  we had lovely lunch along the food street and there are tons of food options along that road maxwell hawker centre is also very close by for what i am told is the best chicken rice in town if you need competitive money exchange rates this area is a good option and in the people is shopping centre there are many exchanges with quite competitive and fee free exchange rates i have been to chinatown many times over the years and love it,Positive
chinatown,bumbling around chinatown was truly an eye opening experience architectural eye candy abounds are these buildings for real whoa look at that building with all those people carved into the building is structure my mouth just dropped viewing scanning the entire chinatown district and i kept saying over and over again whoa look at that oooh i smell curry not just any old curry smell it smells awesome fresh hauntingly delicious and does not smell stale there are so many shops grocery stores hawker stands foot reflexology clinics so much to see so many things to do here the best part about chinatown is the fresh fruit sold and the food cooked here is so delectably delicious everything is made fresh and this place is a foodie is shangrila there is no doubt in my mind why anthony bourdain visited chinatown,Positive
chinatown,i loved this part of singapore the street are filled with souvenirs shops as well as food places it also has a historical background to it and tries to show its chinese heritage the streets were full with guirlandes,Positive
chinatown,chinatown garden bridgea large pedestrian walkway bridge across eu tong sen street and new bridge road it connects the people is park complex with the pedestrian mall of pagoda street you can access the chinatown mrt station from either side of this bridge,Negative
chinatown,for tourists you have to drop by here to check out the older part of singapore which the chinese culture plays a role to the development of this country located at the heart of singapore you can take the mrt to either outram station or chinatown station and just walk to your heart is content there are lots of good eating places along the streets catering for both locals and tourists prices especially at the food street can be quite expensive but do check out the long queues as they are usually good alternatively you can visit the nearby maxwell food centre which serves good local food and if you walk a bit further amoy street food centre is another good option this would be one of the first venues i take my foreign friends here usually in the evening exploring the beautiful shop houses getting goodies for their friends back home grabbing some good food and dessert and after that walk to clarke quay which is a stop away or  minutes walk to the bars to enjoy the rest of the evening so if you are a first timer to singapore you have to include visiting chinatown in your itinerary for good food you can check out these places that i frequently visit in this area tiong bahru porridge maxwell food centreamoy street food centremei heong yuen desserttong heng confectionary egg tart is not bad,Positive
chinatown,we took a walking tour of chinatown where the guide giving the free tour was compensated by tips from the tourists we probably saw only  of chinatown but this part of town included the chinatown heritage center and the outrageously cheap hawker chan michelin one star restaurant looking around ourselves we also found the nanyang old coffee shop serving local traditional singapore coffee pre starbucks and the fragrance store for beef jerky just see where people are queuing up this was an excellent orientation to the history and activities in chinatown as well as a visit to buddhist temple constructed in  seeing the exterior of an older indian temple and learning about the chinese name for singapore posted on a few of the the gateway entrances read some of the gold colored plates on a few of the posts to get more history do not miss the chinatown heritage center is well worth the price of admission to see how the early settlers lived small rooms that could be shared by multiple individuals and families the staff at the chinatown visitor center were very helpful in orienting us to queues for the night safari next to the zoo signs for the public restrooms can be more prominent so the restrooms can be easily found,Positive
chinatown,i am not really sure if i can say all that more about chinatown than what i have already said but if there is one really bustling part of singapore it is this place okay there are the markets and in fact the markets pretty much make up the largest part of this area however there is more than just the markets here you can find heaps of restaurants serving up authentic chinese food which is by far and away the best type of chinese food as well as a number of temples including the buddha tooth museum they even have one of those authentic squares that you see scattered about the place in hong kong where old men sit around the table playing chinese checkers or some other game this is definitely a must visit place in singapore oh there is also an mrt station right in the middle so it is really really easy to reach,Positive
chinatown,during my visit to singapore i really enjoyed walking around and seeing the various delights of chinatown here you can easily go around and shop for cutesy souvenirs that are reasonably priced and there are plenty of food places to try i recommend allowing yourself at least half a day here since there is quite a bit to do if you swing by here early morning make a small trek to maxwell food centre for some breakfast since most of the vendors are not opened until like am or later after breakfast take your time in browsing the different vendors and small shops most of the vendors will sell similar things at similar prices and there does not seem to be much haggling involved some of the major attractions within chinatown is chinatown complex the temple visitor center and etc i highly recommend stopping by the complex for lunch food on the second level of the complex you will find a hawker center that is literally filled with various food stalls if you like to shop for clothes there is an abundant amount of vendors on the first floor of the complex that sells only clothes if you are a tourist and want to make a one stop kind of deal on buying tickets to major attractions stop by the visitor center my friends and i purchase our tickets in advance to the singapore flyer gardens by the bay and night safari there and managed to save money on some small discounts as for the temple it is really easy to find but do keep in mind that if you visit shorts and tanks are not allowed so remember to cover up with the garments that are provided by the temple at the entrances overall this was quite a pleasant experience and i would highly recommend it to anyone visiting singapore,Positive
chinatown,while walking around in singapore we decided to take the subway and head to chinatown it is almost very similar to many other peoples chinatown they sell chinese food cheap vacation gifts to give to friends and it was super busy did i say it was also really really hot i felt like there was no shade here at all and the heat was super crazy but at least one thing good about that is you will loose a gang load of weight we had our lunch in chinatown ate some duck which was cooked perfectly too bad i did not have wifi so i do not know the name of the duck place but it is in chinatown if you want to walk around and just see things to buy this is a place to visit,Negative
chinatown,overall    stars i love the fact that there is an mrt station here so it makes it very convenient to come here from our hotel we came during the day so we did not stay too long out on the streets due to the heat there are lots of little shops for you to pick some souvenirs and there is even a food street we were headed over to maxwell food centre so we did not eat here we went into the big hindu temple as well which was free just take off your shoes we will have to stop by again at night the next time we are in singapore to explore this area more,Positive
chinatown,proud to be chinese   zung gwok zhong guo my asian  travels whisk me to chinatown singapore chinatown in the district of outram where finally the streets are clean and so many moderately priced food options and chinese souvenirs yet with an ethnic singaporean chinese flair as curry powder red bean paste buns soya bubble tea and slice beef jerky it fends a southeast asian immersion to the historic parts of singapore with a longstanding cultural presence there are many ethnic singaporean chinese buddhist temples gifts of feng shui and colorful chopsticks of chinese cultural elements are readily available a night market contains many moderately priced peddlers where visitors can bargain until comprised as like most enclosed crowded areas of any major city beware of pickpockets for visitors who are not afraid to be immersed in asian culture with an open mind singapore chinatown is surely a worthwhile visit,Positive
chinatown,i am so impressed with singapore is chinatown i am glad that i spend some time to wander around the streets and get lost here a little the charming well restored buildings great photo ops the history the largest and oldest record of chinese community at  chinatown the numerous restaurantsthe small food storesthe souvenirs storesall these drinking places has huge photos of ice cold big beer for  i really want to have one of those the templesplaces with durian snacks i definitely will be back next time when i am in town,Positive
chinatown,if they had enough seats such a busy little street smith st lots of food options with street stalls in the centre of the street and restaurants on the side the stalls sell mostly hawker food there was a  minute wait between ordering and receiving food at the satay stall almost impossible to get a table to eat had to share which is not a problem but it took a few tries asking people until i actually found someone who would let me sit with them food at most of the stalls is good and quite well priced but some of the staff at the stalls are so unorganised and lack of seating to eat meals is a real problem here get off at chinatown mrt to get here,Negative
chinatown,very touristy quite akin to many other chinatowns in other cities lots of souvenirs for sale food stands red lanterns hanging from the top i did notice the world is largest coin on display so that was something a bit different one shop had a bunch of old chinese artifacts for sale when my bf asked how much the giant buddha sculpture went for the guy said too much lol it was an antique worth thousands i saw a lot of name chops that were kind of cute but i already have one somewhere in my parents house i think and besides i never use those things we walked into a shopping mall that was a bit old and decrepit and quite dead one shop had a funny sign that said out for lunch dinner if you need me i will skip dessert i had to use the bathroom and the ones on the upper floors were locked probably due to lack of tenants nearby so i went to the one on the bottom floor and discovered a squatter have not seen one of those in ages since i was a wee girl in taiwan there was not anything worth shopping for in the mall so we just took a quick look at some of the jade ornaments for sale and then walked on out,Negative
chinatown,loads of trinket shops and average restaurants line the streets and alleys of chinatown great for inexpensive souvenirs best experience is the durian vendor whose packaged durian can be smelled for up to a block away you have to smell it to believe it,Positive
chinatown,chinatown is an ethnic neighbourhood featuring distinctly chinese cultural elements and a historically concentrated ethnic chinese population chinatown is located within the larger district of outram as the largest ethnic group in singapore is chinese chinatown is considerably less of an enclave than it once was however the district does retain significant historical and cultural significance large sections of it have been declared national heritage sites officially designated for conservation by the urban redevelopment authority i spent a morning wandering around and shopping i ended up with some nice jade a wood comb that i still use and at few turned down offers to fit me with a nice suit,Positive
chinatown,this is one big chinatown and definitely the cleanest of the lot they have many shopping and food options available here i loved walking around chinatown and checking out the scene and life here loved the street food options and my wife liked the shopping aspect here must visit the buddha tooth relic temple here,Positive
chinatown,the chinatown in singapore was actually kind of a letdown with so many asian and chinese influences in food and culture and history i made a point to go to the chinatown here especially since it was within walking distance of downtown singapore when i got there though i was rather disappointed as opposed to the rest of singapore that is well kept and enjoyable to walk through the chinatown was kind of a dump with some parts bordering on a slum small shops and grimy miss were everywhere as opposed to the chinatown in america and other countries i was let down i did not even bother saying you are too long because there is actually nothing of touristic value to see there it is not a bustling destination like the chinatown in san francisco for instance so i think it is just somewhat of a tourist trap i cannot say i recommend making chinatown a destination since it is lost its old world charm long ago,Negative
chinatown,cleanest chinatown ever i am a magnet and postcard kind of souvenier shopper for the cheapest value take the pagoda street mrt exit go straight until you hit a t intersection where you can either go straight or right and shop around there one of the stores has some ugly magnets for a dollar but the best deal i found was  for  as for postcards one store had ugly postcards  for  but the better ones were  cents each so many food stands to choose from too but for real hawker style food walk over to maxwell food centre jonasapproved,Positive
chinatown,china town food that will change the way you look at our libations forever the real treat is to go to the food mart across the street of the temple an evening watching the traditional fire walkers charge the mosque is for some great entertainment,Positive
chinatown,one of the things that remain impressive to me having visited singapore many times is the preservation of heritage buildings by retaining the exterior architecture many of these heritage buildings have the recognizable style of windows and today there could be restaurants bars and boutiques that occupy these buildings in singapore is chinatown the building preservation is no different each storefront has their windows painted uniquely so that each store carries its own character and personality people will say this is probably the cleanest chinatown they have been to but of course this is singapore we are talking about ironically we have heard laments from a few friends who see this environment as too artificial and they long for the old days where the streets felt more natural well the old days are not going to come back though one can always continue to romanticize the past for now we still have these buildings no matter how overly preserved they may be if there is such a thing to cling on to that offer a glimpse of the past the main commercial strips of chinatown are along pagoda street and temple street the area beyond the main commercial strips have evolved into a night spot destination among the young professionals who ever says that chinatown is not a place to hang out in the evening along erskine road and ann siang road are boutiques club street has intimate eateries offering european cuisine and these establishments that take on the colorful facade of what one would expect of chinatown my most favorite part of all is how true diversity is reflected in chinatown in the multicultural fashion of this city state there are three different places of worship located on the same street in chinatown the sri mariamman hindu temple jamae mosque and a chinese temple are located just a block from each other along south bridge road,Negative
chinatown,the gold standard of chinatown singapore chinatown puts many other chinatowns to shame this one is the real deal where you can find authentic chinese attire like silk shirts and ties that are far cheaper here than in the u s if you want enjoy real china and hk street food singapore is probably the closest thing you can get outside of china and hk every night is night market here the surprise is that the oldest hindu temple sri mariamman temple is located in chinatown this is definitely a place to visit when you are in singapore you can also find some very good deals on camera here but just be aware that some shops are not as friendly as those on orchard road there is also a train stop here as well this is probably the safest and cleanest chinatown,Positive
chinatown,the cleanest chinatown i have ever been to so weird i have been to chinatowns in many countries and many cities nothing really awesome about this one besides being clean but sg is clean if you are visiting sg for a short while i would pass on this and head to other locals,Positive
chinatown,beautiful architecture temple and there was many souvenir vendors to buy cool stuff singapore is known for the lions so you will mostly find anything lion related if you keep walking you will find yourself in a hawker style food food are a little more pricey here for some dishes,Positive
chinatown,almost tempted to give a  star but c mon it is only chinatown it is a lot more cleaner than other ones esp compared to new york but even this would put vancouver in shame actually a bustling market with pretty much half covered in tents so still shoppable during their rain storms underneath still plenty of stuff to do and see right now w the moon festival chinatown is looking pretty w its colourful paper lanterns strewn all over the lamp posts across the streets safe too only complaint is the unevenness so careful of those high heels and as always mindful of your pockets in those crowded areas one tip for those touristy souvenir t shirts that say i love singapore avoid the shops on the edge you get way better deals if you venture inside the tent area i got raked for double the price lol yet still only  sg per shirt,Positive
chinatown,this is certainly the place to go if you are looking to try various street food and restaurants from several different countries we stumbled upon these winding alleys of food paradise upon hopping off of the bus to visit the buddah tooth relic temple we tried various indian and singaporean dishes and they were all great and very pocket friendly there are also many shops to buy souvenirs at much cheaper prices would definitely love to stop here again,Positive
chinatown,i love to check out chinatown it is historical type of place there are many nice cafes there old coffee shops are perfect too it is a great place to be with your friends,Positive
chinatown,definitely worth a visit cheap eats and souvenirs give your haggling skills a go lots of food stands to choose from i recommend getting some tropical fruits you cannot find at home food plates for lunch or dinner are   each,Positive
chinatown,take the mrt to the chinatown station and start exploring so much of singapore get redeveloped but some of the back streets in chinatown can give you that unique genuine experience of how singapore use to be shopping in this area is more the cultural items that may interest tourists and traditional food outlets to pick up a meal best explored on foot the new mrt station makes chinatown more accessible than ever there are some shopping centres in the area however you are best seeing the back streets people interest in chinatown should also take a look at little india,Positive
the-good-beer-company,beers on tap  dinner different beers in their five coolers an entire cooler is dedicated to dark ales they have some very high grade ales like anderson valley is stout aged in bourbon barrels they also have chimay delirium tremens etc,Positive
the-good-beer-company,i know you will get the spiel that craft beers have been in singapore for a while but it is not till fairly recently that the quality of the game has reached a critical inflection point there have always been joints serving good beer but here is the thing about beer it is a young fermentation product compared to wine and whiskey without going into a lot of geeky detail this just means that as a commodity it has to be handled fastidiously and served attentively beer loses almost all of its blush in a very short time this means that if you are having old beer or beer that is not been handled properly or served incorrectly you are not experiencing the wondrous experience the brewer envisioned for you all that love attention and expertise literally just evaporated in this regard beer is a lot like cheese once you cut into that wheel it slowly dies and the challenge is to serve it all before all the magic disappears therefore the key to determining the quality of any establishment that serves beer in singapore is proper refrigeration and turnover gbc is reasonably busy and that is a good sign it means you are not likely to be getting beer out of a keg that is been sitting for a while and that those kegs are getting emptied and changed fairly frequently make a point to check the bottled on dates on the bottles most pale ales will lose a lot of their charm six months from the time they are bottled in fact most us brewers will pull their beers off the shelf after six months these beers will still be safe to drink they just wo not taste like they were meant to they will likely be good enough for casual consumption where you are paying passing attention to the beer in your hand while engaged in some other broadly social activity enjoy gbc they have certainly put a lot of effort into making sure you not only have good beer but fresh beer and the responsibility lies with us the consumer to make sure that beer stays fresh by turning it over nuts and bolts convenient location right outside kent ridge mrt and nestled among restaurants bars and bottle shops in savourworld,Positive
the-good-beer-company,i am giving it  stars only because it is in a hawker centre but seriously i think it is great that it is in a hawker centre it is no frills you do not need to pay for service charge and the price is not marked up to pay for decorations and shit like that you just order your rare belgian beer or whatever and drink it it is hot and sweaty but what did you expect if you want air con walk  minutes to ann siang hill nearby both office workers from the us europe and  yo uncles from the neighbourhood come here to drink the fish head stall next door is also quite okay,Positive
the-good-beer-company,if you are currently in aa please do not read this review it is not meant for you it is for those who enjoy the finer things in life such as craft beer that you have given up for a stupid token jk i admire what you all in aa are doing keep it up just do not read this review okay here goes singaporeans love hawker centres and especially all the cheap but good food that comes with it i love this particular one not because of the food or the unpleasant scents of dead carcasses from the wet market in the basement that floats up everywhere but because of a small little spot nestled on the nd floor hidden from just about everything else called the good beer company owned by daniel but manned by the sweetest uncle that chuckles while holding a conversation and as excitable as a lil child given a disneyland pass with enough knowledge of beer to garner respect from a beer enthusiast this tiny stall carries just about enough craft beers to please a thirsty camel end run on sentence it is cheap it is glorious it is a destination it is a freaking pilgrimage spot for all ye true beer enthusiasts while everyone else is burning and dying in the singapore heat trying to tour the nearby areas of chinatown why not save yourself from the burning hells by coming here for a brew they even provide the right chilled glasses for your poison of choice they have trappistes stouts ales lagers and enough real juice to keep the world a better place they even carry some pansy craft crap for those who cannot hold anything down for a hawker stall this is pretty freaking amazing so why not take part in the awakening not to mention if you are actually hungry ta ta food all around to stop your whining and raw crap in the basement if you brought your stove logic beckons you to make the right choice if you do not get what i am saying you might want to consider amping up your brain power a bit and a strong trappiste might really aid you in the process oh yeah did i mention it is cheap well now i said it see ya around say hi to uncle goh he freaking works hard and is totally fun to be around ps anyone who gives less that  stars well i figured water and tea is what floats your boat p or you are just in aa lol yelp,Positive
the-good-beer-company,places like these are so very very precious especially for a new england beer snob living abroad to whom tiger beer a good night does not make i will gladly shell out the extra few bucks for a well crafted beer curated by some folks that truly know their stuff you might have some trouble finding it on the second floor of a somewhat out of the way hawker center but the search is worth the reward just follow the white guys with the curly moustaches they all know the way,Positive
the-good-beer-company,there is not that much i can say that has not already been said by others before but i can agree that this place has a really nice beer selection at reasonable prices the service is also friendly and knowledgeable which is a huge plus the environment is perhaps not the most charming but i do like the place and the fact that one can pick up a wise variety of food from any of stalls here just a great place to go for a few excellent craft beers or ciders,Positive
the-good-beer-company,lets face it beer alcohol is expensive in singapore trying to find craft beer that does not require you to mortgage a house is even harder to find so this little gem along with two other craft beer places in the same vicinity is a great find each of them have different craft beers so you can try all different kinds i did not see many white people other than ourselves which was fun because we got to share our love of craft beer with people from literally all over the world now hawekers are not the most fancy places to be but who needs fancy the beer was cold real cold it was cheap ish and it was a great place to talk to old friends and meet new ones best way to find this area it is on the smith street side enterence of the chinatown complex second floor,Positive
the-good-beer-company,i discovered this place after searching the recommended bars in singapore and i must say that it was not what i expected i spent about ten minutes wandering up and down smith street until i realised that it was a part of the chinatown complex jump another fifteen minutes before i first of all work out the numbering of the stalls and then where it is locate only to discover that it was closed however that was because i came here in the afternoon and it does not open until the evening however i was determined not to ignore a yelp recommendation and come night time i make my way back here to check it out and i must say i was not disappointed first of all it is cheap beer which is saying something in singapore and secondly it is specialty beer which is also something because most of the pubs in singapore have a standard offering okay it is not a bar in a traditional sense since it is a part of a food court but it is worth checking out for the beers that they have on offer,Negative
the-good-beer-company,great little spot i discovered with jireh michelle and nik inside the chinatown complex surrounded by food stalls what could be better they have a really great selection and the uncle makes great recommendations he really is the sweetest guy talkative and very friendly i loved the lychee beer i had and i am hoping i can find it in the states they have lots of craft brews from the us ciders for the gluten free crowd and some trappist ales too they provide you with a chilled glass i enjoyed it so much we came back a few nights later for a uye and i brought a large group of friends loved it if only uncle and his cases of beer could be in texas,Positive
the-good-beer-company,if you want to find white people at the chinatown food centre this is your place it is tucked in a very obscure corner that took some time to find but was worth it selection is not huge but very good prices are fair of course there is no ambience as you will sit at the hawker tables with no a c but the people watching is fantastic it is a good break from tiger bonus they have plenty of legit glassware,Positive
the-good-beer-company,uyes are great opportunities to discover interesting haunts and this is one of those that i got to experience through the last uye that i attended a few weeks ago i am not really a beer drinker and i think i would go for a cider anytime cos they are sweeter and more palatable however at the good beer company i actually found beers that i wouldnt mind downing cos the taste is so un beer like i believe i can actually cheat myself that im not really drinking beer at all one such beer is the melon beer that i tried it is so melon y in its scent you can smell it immediately when the bottle cap is removed the taste of the beer is also rather sweet not for the hardcore beer lovers but i actually enjoyed it too bad we cant visit it again anytime soon due to the renovation of the hawker centre hopefully the selection of beers will still be interesting and extensive when they re open,Positive
the-good-beer-company,the good beer company is a hawker stall that sells craft beers and ciders yes you read that right located in the heart of chinatown a guy that refers to himself as beer dude had an ingenious idea of having a specialty beer store inside of a hawker centre so that people can match their hawker food with beer wondering what goes with bar chor mee or claypot rice ask the friendly beer dude i wanted to try their famous lychee beer today but it was sold out boohoo so i requested for something sweet and was recommended the toffee apple cider a refreshing beverage that tastes more like zapple than alcohol with a hint of a toffee aftertaste beer dude went all out with his recommendations he gave me three to pick from and was a pro at describing each of their qualities my friend who did not enjoy sweet alcohol like me ordered a scottish ale with beer dude is recommendation and enjoyed her drink as well everyone should definitely make a trip down here and have a chat with the friendly beer dude and beer uncle and have some of the famous food at chinatown complex while you are at it btw drinks are priced from  to  no gst,Positive
the-good-beer-company,quality belgian european and us beers at a hawker centre in singapore who woulda thunk it well daniel did a beer connoisseur daniel decided to open up this little gem and boy i am glad he did it is a unique ambiance in it is own sense sitting around with a few friends on the second floor of a hawker centre sipping on the delicious hoppy and tasty beers i was afraid i had left behind on other continents the beers are relatively affordable around  a bottle cheap by singaporean standards if you are in the area and want a good brew i highly recommend it,Positive
the-good-beer-company,this is like a beer heaven that no one knows about if you are tired of all those common commercial beer such as carlsberg or heineken and want to look for some rare beers you should definitely head down to the good beer company some might find its hawker centre setting a bit weird but that is part of its charm and yes you can definitely pair good hawker food with good beer the owners are friendly and will happily tell you which beers go well with what you are eating if you are feeling adventurous just pick those devilish looking ones you wo not be disappointed pro tip head just a few stalls down to grab a big pot of the claypot rice it goes great with beer and friends,Positive
the-good-beer-company,who would have thunk that anyone would have the bright idea of bringing specialty craft beers to a neighbourhood hawker center and so the self named beer dude did in a rather quiet part of the hawker center he setup shop intent on bringing the finest brews he can get his hands on across the world if ciders and beers are your thing and you do not want to pay pub prices for them this is a no frills and a damn good way of getting your weekend tipple better than pub grub are our local fare that is around in the complex if you do not want to walk too far for food you can opt to buy some in the neighbouring shops just a few steps away they are good too ask the beer dude for recommendations nothing in his fridge has never been tried before by him they open all days of the week except sundays they open till late on friday and saturdays close up before pm on weekdays,Positive
the-good-beer-company,i had stumbled upon chinatown complex and after checking ye olde yelp app to see what is good i noticed my bookmark of the good beer company popped up after walking around aimlessly trying to find stall  i finally do and i am welcomed with a small but well curated fridge of beers and ciders to choose from as everyone mentioned in prior reviews the trusty uncle was present and gave me a ton of information about the beers i asked about it was really hard to choose but i ended up going for jungle beer is tropical wheat and i definitely was not disappointed i had not even heard of jungle beer before so to me it is a nice local alternative to tiger since it is at a hawker next time i want to bring all of my friends all  of them gahhhh i need friends will you be my friend and we will do a beer and hawker food pairing,Positive
the-good-beer-company,there is something magical about sitting around a rickety picnic table in a steamy hot singapore hawker market drinking an ice cold oregon beer even if that oregon beer is rogue zing daniel the man behind the good beer company is not just an oregon beer fan he is a fan of all delicious or should i say good beer and he has made it his mission to spread the goodness to a land that considers heineken a rare import tucked away in a corner of the chinatown complex you will find over  types of boutique bottled beer and cider something that is not only unusual to find in a hawker centre but anywhere in singapore california and oregon are heavily represented as are the uk and belgium as you would imagine but i was surprised to see a few from switzerland and the netherlands as well the stand out recommended by daniel of course was hitachino nest white ale from japan that tasted like christmas in a bottle if you are a fan of beer head anywhere in singapore but if you are a fan of good beer you will have to come here immediately,Positive
the-good-beer-company,great beer selection good prices but beware to foreigners that have yet to acclimatize to the sg weather if you think its hot outside drinking beers at this hawker center is like drinking a lovely refreshing beer inside your local sauna there is one table that has a fan pointed at it but short of getting that table after two beers dont be entirely surprised if you have a slight buzz the combination of alcohol with the extensive loss of fluids through sweat will make even the most hardcore drinkers have to pace themselves,Positive
the-good-beer-company,every time i bring someone to good beer it is like bringing a kid to a candy store i will leave them there for a while and come back to claim them later take your time and marvel at the wide selection of beers tried and tested by daniel if you here for a meal and cannot decide what to have tell daniel what you are having for dinner and he will do his best to recommend something that goes along throwing a party and wanna pick up some unique craft beers no a problem here as as student the main attraction here has got to be the affordable prices thirsty easties are in luck because they are gonna open a retail outlet in the katong area some time this month so do look out for that,Positive
the-good-beer-company,i cannot get over how amazeballs a bit of mei guo slang this place is they even have american microbrews like rogue this beats the pants off drinking tiger and dealing with the immediate hangover the fact that it is in the middle of the smith st complex and that they can help you decide what food to get with your beer kicks it up a whole other notch carrot cake or xiao long bao life is full of tough decisions they even have the proper glassware to serve your beer why deal with the pretense of clarke quay when you can just get down to the business of drinking delicious beer you can still walk to cq if you want to afterwards i really hope you guys are successful and will be back again next christmas good luck sirs,Positive
the-good-beer-company,the good it is in the dna of an expat to relish the mix of the familiar with the unfamiliar and that is exactly what this place does there is something magical about drinking a microbrew while surrounded by a bustling hawker environment selection is strong and the fellow working uncle of the owner was friendly helpful and just down right adorable the icing in the cake were the prices cheap the bad larger selection since i will be returning often and probably going through most of the brews drafts maybe  regular and another that gets changed periodically and a non alcoholic beer option the ugly closed on sunday please open on sunday that is when us expats drink the most,Negative
the-good-beer-company,what a rare treasure within the labyrinth which is chinatown complex chinatown complex is house to endless rows of hawker stalls the complex is at least stacked with   stories of hawker stalls making it the biggest hawker centre i have seen in singapore you can get lost in there i am serious the place is so big that some hawkers will even refuse to deliver the food to your table because it is simply too far we took awhile to find the stall the good beer company despite one of us having been there before yes it is that confusing thankfully after a few wrong turns google maps and a bit of luck we managed to locate the stall fyi it is at the green section of the complex because the complex is so big it not only differentiate the stalls by unit numbers but also by color each section of the complex is color coded so that the surrounding hawkers and tables within the same zone share a common color our table number was  another indicator of how how big the place was and we were only on the second floor back to the beer we gleefully pick our drinks and gulp them down like thirsty travelers  brothers tutti frutti this is a pear cider laced with berries which gave it a wonderful cheeky pink color it tasted ok i could not really taste any pear though but i could taste the berries just a lot of fizzy  green gobllin this was labelled as cider but it tasted more like a light beer absent was any sweetness you would expect in a cider overall it was ok not what i expected but alright interesting bottle  fuller is organic honey dew strong rich it slid down my throat with a warm tingling sensation and left a subtle after taste of honey service great they were very generous with their tissue paper even encouraging me to take a whole packet for free,Negative
the-good-beer-company,excellent tried hobgoblin red ale a japanese stout and rouge from american amber ales tricky to find as food centre mazes around is located in a corner overlooking smith street on second floor,Positive
the-good-beer-company,i recently visited good beer company and really enjoyed the experience it felt a bit like beer shopping because you go to the stall and pick your beers out of the fridge i liked this because it allowed me to examine the bottles and check out the labels good beer company is located in the chinatown complex market so it really is just a small stall but it still has great variety it is location probably also accounts for the reasonable prices the owner is really friendly and knows his beer very well he will be happy to recommend the right beers to accompany your local hawker fare altogether a very fresh beer drinking experience,Positive
the-good-beer-company,so i brought a friend to good beer and the poor man did not know what hit him we were supposed to grab dinner and a drink before attending an event but j spent many stunned moments before the chiller he later told beer dude that he had lived in the us taiwan and japan for periods of time and it was like all his old friends had come back to visit beer dude and beer uncle were both super helpful and familiar with not just the beers but also the hawker centre itself helping us to find the dishes that we wanted to eat and then recommending good pairings for the food friend j was very pleased because he was recommended a beer he does not usually drink and found it to be a good pairing with the spicy dishes that we had ordered score a new fan for good beer oh and visit often for variety beer dude likes to switch round the menu ever so often and he just came back from a beer festival so expect new things so while you may not get to taste your favorite on your next visit there will always be something new to discover,Positive
the-good-beer-company,for the true beer enthusiast this is the place to be in singapore it has the best selection of american australian and european craft beers that i have seen on the island and they are  cheaper than most places that serve comparable beer daniel is very knowledgeable particularly about pairing with the local hawker food i would recommend grabbing some chicken rice char quay teow or steamed fish head then head over to stall  daniel will put the right beer in your hand and be sure to say hello to beer uncle he works hard,Positive
the-good-beer-company,the good beer company is a very special hole in the wall hangout which serves an excellent choice of beer vastly different from the many pretentious breweries and bars in singapore it is situated in a hawker center right smack in the center of chinatown a definite must try for newbies to the town since it provides a unique setting to drink great beer in a very local setting daniel is super nice and very enthusiastic i guess passion really does make a business the only drawback is that the hawker center is well a hawker center and on hot days it does get hot and let is face it the hawker center is not exactly representative of singapore is clean reputation but drinking a beer there on a rainy day ah there is no place like that,Positive
the-good-beer-company,great beer selection in a hawker eating center they were out of magic hat but told me they should have more in two weeks time so i tried the cooper is pale ale which was very flavorful and refreshing it is bottle fermented if you are craving some upmarket brew to go with your hawker food of choice this is where you need to be,Positive
the-good-beer-company,it is unbelievable that this exists in asia and even more ridiculous that it is in the middle of a hawker center in chinatown if you are a lover of craft beer this is the place to go to and next door where they have even fresher stuff on tap i regularly go here on any visit to singapore and have at least six or seven beers mixing with the delicious xlbs next door the owner is a really fun guy to talk to and his staff is extremely knowledgable i think one might be his girl or niece i am just glad it still has not gotten more popular since the first visit i made last year so i almost hesitate leaving a review best of all the prices are actually reasonable,Positive
the-good-beer-company,good beer company is like the fridge you always wanted you will spend at least  minutes staring that the amazing variety of beers in front of you my suggestion is ask beer uncle to recommend you one do not waste time too many good beers to try,Positive
the-good-beer-company,stopped by the good beer company for a bottle of dessert after having the steamed mini buns from stall   which i would also recommend i found the selection to be more than ample and i settled on rochefort  wich is one of my favorite beers it was priced on the higher side of their beers at  but this is a beer that consistantly ranks as one of the top beers in the world by both ratebeer and beeradvocate the beer was served with the appropriate glassware and i enjoyed the beer while also enjoying watching the chef in the next stall over making hong kong garlic steamed fish head,Positive
taste-paradise,fabulous dim sum as always my favorite was the black truffle shumai and the xo stir fried turnip cake very reasonable price for such a classy establishment hope to come back soon next time i am in singapore,Positive
taste-paradise,semi upscale dim sum cantonese place in ion overall good dim sum chinese dishes personal favorites are the carrot cake stir fried perfectly for the right balance of crispiness chewiness with complementary tangy sauce the pork ribs were also very tender and the char siew pao is definitely one of the better ones i have had at cantonese restaurants in sg the standard items like siew mai etc were standard good what you would expect from this type of chinese restaurantnice ambience and convenient location good for family gatherings a bit expensive and should make reservation,Positive
taste-paradise,service is great the food was yummy had dumplings soup and pork all good,Positive
taste-paradise,it is official taste paradise is my favorite dim sum place in the world this is no exaggeration been to this taste paradise for many years never a time the food was bad or experience a service lapse today was no exception lunch delicious satisfying happy me food   i ordered the following nah i did not finish eating all the staff packed whatever i could not finished for me to take away   for every one of the dim sum dishes i ordered  classic xo carrot cake a must order nobody does carrot cake like taste paradise i had tried similar elsewhere but there is no comparison  baked honey bbq pork pastry this pastry was another item here that was the best compared to many other establishments which offered the same the crust was buttery and flaky in a good way i only despise flaky when it is associated to humans the filling was generous with savory honey bbq pork  char siew bun or stream bbq pork bun the buns were so fluffy  the fillings which were honey bbq pork were savory and so good  steam cheong fun with honey bbq pork fillings rice flour rolls which were thin and soft this is how it should be it was light healthy and tasted good  deep fried prawn dumplings with salad cream generous and fresh prawn fillings in every of the dumplings the dumplings skins were so thin and crispy d ambience  no tacky dcor but elegant beautiful surrounding comfy plushy chairs nice table settings and lots of seatings service  jorrine the hostess at the door had been working here for years i recognized her always friendly and hospitable she led me to one of the room inside the server shaun took very good care of me the moment i sat down he was very pleasant well mannered and attentive taste paradise has never let me down this is the best restaurant i would recommend anyone who visits singapore when they want some top class dim sum chinese food accompanied with  star service and ambience this is truly a well deserving  stars establishment in singapore and ranked the top among all the  stars restaurants i rated,Positive
taste-paradise,made a reservation for dinner a couple weeks ahead via phone and was promptly welcomed upon arrival eating cantonese food in singapore by a singaporean chain was questionable at first the experience was world class meal started off with pickled vegetables which were tasty and flavorful opted for the peking duck wasabi prawns and foie gras appetizer which was just heavenly peking duck was perfectly crispy and the wasabi prawns was flavored to perfection the foie gras was decent entrees included the salted egg prawns which consisted of a dozen or so juicy and flavorful prawns lightly fried and then dipped in salted egg yolk yum the us beef with gai lan was also excellent it was rather odd having us beef in singapore trust me on this one next came the kurobata pork with mushrooms which was also heavenly super tender pork in a world class gravy ended off the meal with lobster with xo sauce noodles and their famous mango pomelo sago lobster was delicious and their xo sauce was on point service throughout the meal was decent seems like we were serviced by a new hire  sgd head after tax and service for dinner,Positive
taste-paradise,i wanted to visit this place because of the soup dumplings i came here on a sunday lunch time and they still had dimsum ordered three items baked bbq pork bun soup dumplings and shark fin soup i liked the pork bun and soup dumplings the pork bun dough was crisp on the outside and the meat inside had a lot of flavour the wrapper is thin and strong that holds the soup and meat well that is how you know it is good wrapper it was my first time eating shark fin soup the soup was light and there is a huge dumpling that holds all the meat the shark fins all dispersed when i opened the dumpling all in all it was a good experience,Positive
taste-paradise,we visited the restaurant which is located at the ion building for dinner if i would have to classify it this is a fine dining chinese restaurant extensive but well appointed decor throughout clearly stating that you are at a classy restaurant very comfortable sitting nice tablecloth all sets you in a mood to prove that this is a fine dining restaurant it offers a great wine selection which includes practically all first growth bordeaux lafite latour mouton rothschild as well as petrus massetto drc and if i was not mistaken even a cult california screaming eagle we had  rauzan sgla with our dinner and the wine was outstanding after  minutes in the glass excellent service starting with wine and food pairing recommendations considering our choice of wine we got recommendations to go with crispy duck instead of peking duck as crispy duck is less sweet and the recommendation was spot on excellent pairing also the duck was cooked perfectly we also had tofu and green beans each dish is excellent on its own one of my dining companions was raving about his cod with spinach sauce we also had the dessert fresh mango pure with an ice cream which is also beautifully presented on top of cold steaming bowl another high point of the dinner experience once again excellent service prompt attentive helpful and friendly definitely recommended,Positive
taste-paradise,beautiful place delicious dim sum wonderful service when you are in singapore try this place,Positive
taste-paradise,weekend dimsum brunch here is usually pretty crowded and require a reservation the dimsum here is delicious the hargao has two shrimps in it and the xo carrot cake is savory and flavorful the xiao long bao doesnt break easily and has lots of soup in it while the liu sha bao oozes when you bite into it the egg tart is also best eaten when served warm the bbq pork is rather pricey but one of the best i have had definitely highly recommended,Positive
taste-paradise,hands down this is the best dim sum restaurant i have been to anywhere in the world including hong kong which had seen a drop in the quality and service quality the last time i was there the hargow and siewmai is excellent as well as the lobster noodle their soup is also great with excellent flavor,Positive
taste-paradise,move aside crystal jade taste paradise is the next big thing for chinese food in singapore why i keep coming back despite having to reserve every time i wanna eat here  conveniently located above orchard mrt which is in highest floor of ion mall  not overpriced or overrated  polite servers  have dim sums every sundaymy  most fave dishes  blueberry foie gras braised vermicelli their bestseller in carb dept  hot almond paste soup for dessertlove this place a lot,Positive
taste-paradise,is this what paradise tastes like because i can definitely get used to this first let is start with their impeccable service the servers here are polite friendly and actively try to engage in conversation they see you as an actual person rather than just another customer constantly checking in to make sure everything is up to standards their interior is very similar to hotel restaurants you find in mainland china with revolving round tables and private vip rooms their food might come out a bit slow but it is worth it given the fantastic quality the shark fin soup is best i have had anywhere clear crisp broth with subdued flavoring that enhances the shark fin rather than overpowering it which is something i have experienced on numerous occasion in the past the spring roll that comes with it also adds another element in the texture department with the flaky crispy shell playing foil to the soft fins their garlic fried and boiled lobster was also delicious offering two interesting takes on the classic lobster dish the fried pieces were not overly greasy and had enough meat to counterbalance the shell the boiled meats however were the real creme de la creme served in a butter garlic sauce each tender piece of meat melted the moment it entered your mouth delivering an explosion of flavor among the other dishes i thought their peking duck was cooked perfectly though the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking their braised pork cubes and steak bits were also pretty good though a bit on the fatty side in terms of drinks there was nothing too standout so i would recommend just sticking to tiger all in all a fantastic dining experience at one of my favorite places in singapore,Positive
taste-paradise,this is one of my favorite dimsum spots in singapore it is in orchard where all the action is the decor is amazing inside tea kettle is quite peculiar food is amazing from the egg tarts to the pork ribs a must is a liu sha bao or the egg custard bun careful though as it is very hot,Positive
taste-paradise,i do not give out  stars lightly best dimsum in singapore forget the terrible tim ho wan seriously or the cramped and overrated victor is kitchen wtf this place has dimsum to match hkg has great service and is reasonably priced xo sauce carrot cake is a die die must try and all other usual dimsum fare are of great quality har kow and siu mai are large and full of flavour i am also slightly addicted to the little pickles they give for appetiser just make sure you make a booking on the weekends forget trying to walk in,Positive
taste-paradise,we had lunch from the dim sum menu as other reviewers had pointed out the dim sum is all round very well prepared we had plenty of items and the hits included carrot cake sheng jian bao soupy pork buns har gow prawn dumpling shumai pork dumplings however one star off for slow service repeated badgering was required and we had to wait unduly long to be brought our menus to have our orders taken and to get our iced water refilled we paid s   for  adults and  child,Positive
taste-paradise,my friend strongly recommended me the place for dim sum i have been meaning to bring my parents here for weekend is dim sum galore alas they are always fully booked on a lazy sat afternoon i managed to get a table for after  pm they still serve dim sum at that time yay we ordered the usual char siew so which is extremely delicate and crispy it is a must order dish here next came the xo carrot cake which i heard so much about it tastes good and the carrot cake is chunky i think another place which may be better than here or on par is at chinatown is spring court i honestly could not be bothered with taking photos subsequently cuz the food was just too delicieus to ignore we had the braised foie gras in blueberry reduction it is super yummy i would say it is basically foie gras terrine with blueberry jam crackling pork belly could be one of the best served in singapore i could have a whole plate to myself again i think that goes for every single dish that we ordered will come back for moreeeeeeee,Positive
taste-paradise,i have been here a few times and keep coming back convenient location inside ion reliable dim sum and elegant surroundings make me a repeat customer yes it is a bit pricier than other places but i like the fact that there is quality food proper tablecloths porcelain china and pretty teapots dim sum lunch was  and we left with happy and satisfied bellies for the same price i was at marmalade pantry at the stables where i paid for  subpar dish and  latte helped me decide to not go to mp again ask for a table in the back section the drapes are drawn allowing the sunshine in i sat in the front section of the restaurant this time and it was kinda dark must xo carrot cake exquisitely made here shrimp dumplings avoid bbq pork belly it was something like  for the tiniest portion i have ever seen,Positive
taste-paradise,have been coming here for the last   years and their egg custard bun is still in my opinion consistently the best great location great ambience the rest of their dim sum is great as well crackling pork belly is heavenly unfortunately everything comes at a price in this case quite literally the pork belly costs something like  for a tiny portion the rest of their dishes are also pricey worth it but you probably cannot afford to come here too often,Positive
taste-paradise,one of the better ones in the league of siew yok roast pork in singapore i have returned time and again for it alone crispy and crunchy skin with tender flesh and a sliver of fat not too much just enough to be justifiable for those counting calories whilst most rave about dim sum here best dish in my humble opnion is mango prawn not quite the traditional favourite but the best one for me i thought their usual fare was more impressive winter melon soup was served steaming hot in a hollowed out winter melon a little corny but may be the reason it tasted better than others cod was very well cooked and it made my day that my mango sago came with a trailing smokey stream of dry ice for only   i was getting all the fireworks the restaurant is lavishly decorated typical of chinese opulence but with just a touch of modernity it may annoy you that the wait staff continuously stress that you can only stay for min hr  hr before you have to vacate your table but service is prompt and attentive and the quality of food easily makes up for everything else,Positive
taste-paradise,coming from the us i have never had an amazing dim sum experience such as this one the place is very classy and the attentiveness of the staff is on par with restaurants that cost x as much over in the states the price is a little on the heavy side compared to the local street food but you certainly get what you pay for and comparatively from the us it is the same as regular crappier dim sum establishments if you are looking for some of the best brunch experiences in singapore taste paradise is certainly one of them,Positive
taste-paradise,my family i are their loyal customers we have been following them since their st cze char seafood place in defu lane industrial eastate we love their signature dish stone pot shark is fin soup super much they use superior stock for their broth they are generous with their ingredients their ingredients are fresh not inferior at all their peking duck set dinner reunion set dinner always overwhelming response my family has to make very early reservation their dim sum are also our family is favourite yummy worth trying,Positive
taste-paradise,i am from hong kong and let me say that taste paradise probably makes the most exquisite dim sum in asia outside of hong kong their egg tart melts in your mouth salted egg yolk buns has so many layers of flavor i thought i was in paradise must order dishes also includes the xo carrot cake peking duck and the foie gras xiao long bao which are much much better than those from their sister chain paradise dynastty you can actually taste real foie gras in them the restaurant is a bit on the pricey side but really i think it is well worth the money,Positive
taste-paradise,currently my favourite restaurant for chinese food and dim sum the dishes at taste paradise are more exquisitely crafted and refined compared to crystal jade imperial treasure and tung lok must try dishes is their signature superior shark is fin in supreme broth accompanied with crispy spring roll that is served in a japanese stone pot if you are a supporter of the no shark fin campaign the other dishes you must order is the xo carrot cake peking duck char siew and custard buns a great place to host clients and overseas guests as well as weekend dim sums my family has been holding our reunion dinners there since  and it continues to exceed our expectations every year without fail so far,Positive
taste-paradise,tasty dim sum pretty standard offerings with ha gow and siu mai get the pork bun pastry that was a stand out,Positive
taste-paradise,so not get me wrong this place had some good dimsum but the rent and tablecloths in this place are clearly not cheap and the prices reflect that i am not sure it was so exemplary to be worth paying the type of prices they demand for example the wasabi shrimp were unique and interesting but the shrimp themselves were not that flavorful,Negative
taste-paradise,this concept restaurant of paradise holdings often gets outshone by the infamous rainbow xiao long baos of its counterpart paradise dynasty that lies steaming just four storefronts down but if you are in the mood to shell out a little more for a fantastic chinese meal this is just the place to be brought a visiting relative here for dinner and every dish was worthy of praise the spare ribs in sweet sauce is the first dish that comes to mind caramelised sauce hangs off succulent tender meat that you wo not be able to get enough of the tasty crackling skin of the peking duck wrapped in thin popiah sheets is also probably one of the best i have ever tasted in singapore another must try would be the perfectly baked cod that simply melts in your mouth the interior of the restaurant is little too over the top for my liking but most will probably like it for the posh feel about it,Positive
taste-paradise,situated in the ion mall this restaurant specializing in dim sum was excellent comfortable seating and modern design we sat in one of the side rooms next to the window and were served tea to start btw tea is not complimentary the service i have to say was on point very attentive and accommodating one issue was they forgot to bring out a few bowls of corn soup that was ordered so we ended up canceling and the english proficiency was not great but overall we were pleased preparing the peking duck rolls takes time the star of course was the outstanding food the dumplings fois gras pork and shrimp were excellent the previously mentioned peking duck was beautiful the crisp fatty skin rolls were scrumptious and the meatized with noodles was delicious we loved the light bouncy xo carrot cake which by the way i still do not know why it is called carrot cake the beef and scallion was juicy and creamy i would highly recommend taste paradise for your dim sum gorging pleasure,Positive
taste-paradise,taste paradise is one of my favourite places for dim sum they have a good variety of the traditional har gau siew mai stuff but they also have some innovative new dim sum items that are not available anywhere else food m and i are fans of the salted egg yolk custard bun taste paradise offers one of the best salted egg yolk buns in singapore my only gripe is that they only offer the steamed version and not the deep fried mantou version at man fu yuan their har gau shrimp dumplings and siew mai pork dumplings are very fresh and well executed may the manager of taste paradise informs us that they are made fresh every morning i really liked the prawn mango roll which is encased in a lightly crumbed roll instead of beancurd skin mayonnaise is also thoughtfully included in the roll so it all oozes out nicely in one moreish bite the char siew sou puffs are really quite awesome good meat to pastry ratio and the latter is light buttery and flaky the carrot cake with xo sauce is not bad but i prefer the one at space my humble house the steamed beancurd skin with bacon rolls are pretty awesome as well but the wu kok deep fried yam puffs do not taste as good as they look the double boiled soups are also excellent very tasty and great for a cold day the dessert of aloe vera with ice jelly and wolf berries is extremely refreshing too ambience i like how they have private rooms so one can request for them if one chooses not to be caught up in the hustle and bustle in the main dining hall the layout is a bit labyrinth like but nice modern chinese decor with pictures of the different emperors from various dynasties in the private rooms service prompt polite and overall perfect may runs a tight ship and trains her staff well will be back for dinner soon,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,loved the ambience service staff they asked if i have any food preference allergies very attentive we had the  omakase dinner and we had a wonderful dining experience with the cocktails concocted for us definitely will look forward to go back again,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,all the drinks are pricey even with the hh list attached of  drinks what a steal sense the dripping sarcasm haji lane is a must for locals and tourists alike it is known as the heart of boutique shopping in the muslim quarter but after a few shops down everything starts to blend in expensive wooden panelling and chic not really our fashion vibe so we turned to the cool libations and food spots here there were cafes and restaurants open while we window shopped but even more exciting are the second story hidden bars maison ikkoku was the first second story bar we visited in haji lane that day we were the first ones inside around pm and luckily it was happy hour i guess singapore has a different idea of happy hour because drinks were a hefty  i got the passion thymes gin vodka passionfruit thyme lemon while my sis got the moscow mule i loved my sweet drink i got it because of the passionfruit but it is on the sweet side thank goodness for the thyme which balances it out the mule was smoky because of the garnish he torched however it was a refreshing mule just like all other mules they were delicious so say the least but after one i would not want to order another round because that would be almost  for two drinks per person like are you kidding me this is not bayfront or mbs i do not understand affordability would be so much more welcoming especially to tourists however service by our cocktail connoisseur was great he made the drinks in a much more timely manner compared to the guys at bar stories but he was not as warm or talkative it seemed like he knew we would just get one round of drinks and peace out because hell o it is freakin expensive cannot blame me for that i would definitely come back here again for their libations they are not snobby about their drinks and they definitely do not take  minutes to make you a sipper their bar space is beautiful and airy which is hard to achieve given how small the upstairs space really is,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,very nice cafe coffee shop during the day its small so you might need to wait for a table once seated you order at the counter food was tasty and portions were generous with sufficient options for vegetarians i loved the avocado on toast topped with cherry tomatoes the scrambled eggs were a little too soft for me taste but i am extremely picky about that the flavour seasoning was great coffee was a touch sour but still decent the cakes all looked amazing egg dishes were about   each it seemed reasonable by singapore standards,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,dude i have been here two times in the past month i tried the signature  course menu on my first visit and it did not disappoint creative dishes and also paired with  different cocktails also as it was a friday during lent the chef was gracious enough to substitute a veggie dish for my main course since i was not eating meat second time around i went for the omakase menu peep the pictures its  courses for under  is there a better deal just relax and enjoy the chef even came over to talk to us about what he prepared nice touch location is awesome cool points for date nights or to impress people from out of town i am coming back as i have a queue of visitors coming through bartenders also excellent and super nice i heart this place,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,excellent service been wanting to try this place for sometime the lobster udon and lobster linguine were very good the chicken sliders and salmon don were good the bespoke cocktail was freshly made only thing was the place was a bit cramped,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,as far as surprise dinners go this was a success the surprise was meant for my husband but never having been to fort it was for me too in a way i liked the fact that you drive up the hill fort canning park not really knowing where you end up it is beautiful up there and the pinacoteque de paris is a wonderful example of a heritage building we walked around for what seemed like ages not finding any signs whatsoever and then called the restaurant to ask for guidance as they were not allowed to put up any signs outside just walk into the building and look for black signage the entrance to the restaurant is quite inconspicuous and the place is really small really small looking at the photos i would have imagined some kind of room with space for tables but literally all it is is a large rectangular bar divided by a ceiling to floor crimson curtain the chef at one end of the room in his small sushi kitchen and some hipster lighting exposed filament bulbs a nice touch is the small terrace outside you can use for a smoke or just getting some warmer air where you can also follow the action of the shakespeare in the park show drawing to a close depending on the hour of course the welcome was very friendly and the seating at the bar quite ok despite the chairs not being too comfy we ordered water and were asked when opting for cocktails what our go to drinks usually were as this is a bespoke bar the mixologist would prepare something that should then come close to your favourite drink using homemade infusions and literally mixing it up a bit so he did my husband received a great alternative to his beloved negroni with earl grey infused gin and i loved the new take on my manhattan for dinner we went with the  course omakase which had started right away and i can only say that we enjoyed each course immensely our mixologist matteo also the only staff on duty that evening apart from the chef explained each course to us and also suggested how to eat it e g how to mix the flavours on the plate for a truly delectably experience very fresh ingredients and lovingly prepared portions are however on the small side which is to be expected from a  course meal and we did feel quite hungry still having some food at home later on although this might have had to to with our alcohol intake as well all in all we had a lovely evening and would readily visit fort and matteo again,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,fort by maison ikkoku located at the serene and idyllic fort canning hill is a new cocktail bar and fusion dining concept helmed by executive chef and head mixologist ethan leslie leong the creative team applied different styles and techniques of cocktail mixing such as distillation infusion spherification dehydration emulsion and smoking to bring you chemical transformation of ingredients and the best of molecular gastronomy to elevate your dining experience the  signature mainstays available in their ala carte menu are the sea the nest and the fort all in all the synergy of the gourmet dishes with ingenious cocktail pairings brings me on a gastronomical journey fit for an epicure in a truly magical setting no less,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,overdue review from my last trip i came here on a saturday morning with my sisters for breakfast so many cafes have popped up in singapore that i am skeptical half the time but this one really delivered i enjoyed the piccolo latte and french toast with caramelized bananas place has a nice laid back vibe and is not way too crowded on a saturday morning when we went there,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,when i received my bespoke cocktail i just stopped and stared and stared some more it was just that pretty and then i was not sure i could drink it because what a waste that would be so yes maison ikkoku they make pretty damn good cocktails both literally pretty as well as the figuratively i was really happy with my tweaked old fashioned as well as kiwi something i call it bellissima staff are really friendly and knowledgeable atmosphere is really nice and this is a great place to chill out with your date and people watch,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,came to the bar about pm on a wednesday night for a nightcap another mixologist bar where the men take pride in their dressing and drinks nothing spectacular a safe bet in terms of cocktails where the mixologists mix according to what you feel like i asked for something fruity and with a thick layer of egg white foam yum i got a fabulous diana v and my companion got a french maid which is essentially coffee and alcohol i would not say this place is stunning but it is quite cosy and nice i would still rather go to the horse is mouth instead,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,the espresso is really good at this place the cakes although huge and pic worthy is just average imo they are  people size so you will struggle even with  people i dunno i know that cake is a simple dessert but i rather have a smaller dessert that wows me lady m when it comes to dessert maybe it is the motion of the ocean rather than the size of the  star on the espresso though yumz,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,it is hip because there are naked light bulbs hanging from the central bar it is a great place for first dates yes if you are a teenager or in your early s cos it is cheap  plus for dinner omakase honestly it is not an omakase dinner it demeans and disrespects the word omakase it is not sophisticated service is patchy at best drinks are mediocre and if you are a real foodie have been to a number of decent restaurants you will know what i mean whatever seating you go for the earlier dinner or later service means you eat with everybody else they serve everybody all at once the same course so yeah i was starving by  pm and finally the first dish was served all dishes were what you would expect an  year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with the dishes mostly japanese inspired were ok at best and some were quite laughable just imagine a run of the mill japanese chain restaurant in singapore and whatever they have on the menu just itemized into very small portions and you get to try about   dishes that is your dinner at fort cocktails are made a la bar stories what do you like sour ok so it is some vodka kiwi yuzu concoction nothing like bar stories unsophisticated wait staff varies none were rude but obviously that is not an acceptable baseline one of the waitresses serving us could not enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes obviously wo not return you have been warned,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,had a great coffee in here liz was managing and can really work the very state of the art expresso machine great atmosphere and very engaged friendly staff as it was slow i got many kind tips about the neighborhood this is a brilliant business model be kind when you can clients will return to that,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,i have only been here for brunch and coffee and cake on weekends love the brunchy egg dishes and coffee the cake we had was decent but not something to rave about coffee is really good smooth it is always crowded on weekends and with that came the noise which is loud enough to give you a headache service is average to non existent especially when everyone is rushing around when it is full house probably a   stars place  stars for the food and coffee  stars for the service and ambience,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,yes our favorite brunch co now has a cool and classy restaurant bar sister at pinacotheque de paris on fort canning hill the menu sees a line up of bespoke cocktails alongside pretty plates of mod japanese food and the entire concept is developed by the familiar ethan leslie leong who is both the executive chef and master mixologistmuch thought has gone into the cocktail pairing multi sensory dining experience at fort by mi expect to be surprised by the changing scents textures sounds flavors and techniques showcased in the food and tipples preparation it is a f b lab with the insert chemical process here processes going on right before our eyes some highlights from the a la carte dishes here the sea  is a pretty sashimi platter which layers on hokkaido scallop irish oyster seaweed ikura tobiko and ebiko on a bed of sea salted ice it is gorgeous but the overall flavor was a little too salty for me with all that roe and it got fishy as well the nest  is such a festive plate does not it remind of easter think of this as a western chawanmushi which combines hot melted mozzarella and parmiagiano reggiano with free range chicken eggs not a fan of the smoked hay it smelled like gym socks but i guess that adds to the overall rustic appeal of the fish a mod sushi roll which is quite fiery is the spicy maguro hand roll the fort  pcs  pcs  pcs the heat comes from a special asian chili sauce added to the minced tuna which was a bit mushy but the overall bite was quite shiok to end off the dinner the delicious martell cordon bleu lavender crme brle silky custard infused with the subtle lavender and a buttery caramel cognac end the night perfectly with the snowman a concoction of spice rum with buttered popcorn hazelnut and milk which is another dessert in a cup i am definitely coming back for the super affordable  course omakase for just  pax ethan definitely has many more tricks up his sleeves bespoke cocktails are priced at  and infusion shots at,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,i have heard plenty from my friends who have been here and they raved so much about the coffee atmosphere and food that i simply had to try it sooner rather then later although it was a saturday evening at around pm there was not much crowd we nabbed a cozy spot next to the door with sofas and our back to the wall panelling it was a pretty interesting place as we had the privilege of looking at the types of people walking in the door my keen eye spotted a socket plug at our table and immediately started charging my phone coffee was excellent while the lady lemon cake that we ordered looks tasty but fell flat to our expectations they have other cake selections on display as well but the selection names did not catch my attention the staff service is highly commendable even though we were seated near the door the cashier took note of our departure and bid us adieu would definitely be back here again tips our seat had  socket plugs so internet phone junkies would love this spot to recharge your phone do not sit outside unless you are sure that the people at the table next to yours are not going to smoke if you prefer a cooler air conditioned experience it is better if you take a seat further into the cafe,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,set in a trendy area of singapore this place is also clearly mainly aimed at the hipsters perhaps the hipster have already left the area for cooler places but the popularity of maison ikkoku seems to still remain they do coffee cocktails and food the coffee is surprisingly good i was a bit skeptic after looking at them make it as it appeared i got a new employee trying to learn how to make coffee but it the kenyan coffee came out clean and crisp perhaps lucky that i ordered it as an aeropress as it is one of the more forgiving brew methods they offer an extensive food menu where a lot of the items are fairly pricey but everything i have had here has however been very good and the cheese and garlic bagel is both good and good value but it appears to be a seasonal dish so try it now the handcrafted cocktails are also good but a bit pricier than other as good places in singapore a general issue for both coffee and cocktails is the slow service they are very friendly but even when it is almost empty it can take a very long time to even be able to place an order and even longer to get it brought to the table if they would up the service a little bit i would change the rating to a four without a doubt,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,cafe changed management on st july  they are no longer doing brew coffee too bad as i have been coming here for the brews time to explore others all the best to the new mgt anyway,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this place would have received a   star review except the bar was so rude charging me a  drink and forcing me to pay  tip for a bar trick f you chris a who came to visit me from l a and i were catching up when a bartender interrupted my conversation and asked if we wanted to see a trick of course we reluctantly said agreed she then asked for a  put the bill in between two beer bottles and asked us to remove it without tipping the bottles over or she will place the  bill in the tip jar w t f would i come back again i do enjoy the drinks but forcing me to tip ha,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this was my favorite cocktail bar however on my last two most recent visits the cocktails are just not up to par they are awesome if ethan himself is mixing them but when left to the other mixologists the drinks just do not step up still love the space and the concept just do not believe in paying their pricing for the quality of the drinks that i am getting the search continues for the next perfectly balanced cocktail in that elusive bar in singapore,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this cafe is one of the better brunch places i have been to in singapore the food served is really good and the coffee oh man that is just the finishing touch on a good brunch i had the smoked salmon scrambled and the portion was huge enough for  to share well we wanted to share cause we needed to save space for the desserts the scrambled egg and the salmon went so well that i am going for that combination from here on the multigrain bread as soft and easy to eat which was lovely the guacamole is too awesome for words i am not a fan of guacamole but boy did i wipe out all of it this time around i had an iced cafe latte skinny which was so fragrant the last time i remembered having such good coffee was at a coffee joint at bowery street new york desserts is a must this time around we went for the rainbow cake last slice btw and it was so good not too sweet that it turns you off it seemed like a mix between a carrot cake and a cheese cake this place is really good and a must go,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,we got to maison ikkoku around noon on a sunday evidently peak brunch time as the tiny cafe was already packed however we were quite lucky there is still a table for two that is only reserved for pm since we were not planning on chatting or taking our sweet time there we promised we would be in and out before then i immediately zero ed in on the smoked salmon omelette  mainly for the chunky guac side while my sister got croque madame  i was pleasantly surprised by the portion the food itself was also enjoyable although i preferred my omelette to be a little less done i also enjoyed the side salad with roasted almonds and lemony olive oil dressing at maison ikkoku you place the order yourself at the cashier and get your own iced water and condiments they do not charge service charge because of this while i was ordering at the cashier i spotted a spam musubi  on their counter and decided to give it a try as well spam musubi is one of the best things that came out of hawaii imo and maybe ryan higa p maison ikkoku is spam musubi yum i enjoyed the seasoned rice and it is pretty cheap for the size i think it is pretty hard to mess this one up anyway,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,small place tucked in at the end of kandahar street chanced upon it while walking around and then read good reviews online nice place nice service you have to order yourself at the counter which is not a stretch at all the salted french toasts were amazing the orange juice was great too freshly squeezed but somehow when i saw it had froth around it almost looking like a mango shake would i go again yes i would especially is one is in the arab street area there is no other place which is a worthy competition for mi except maybe the hangar but then it is overcrowded and one is always under the feeling that one should leave soon,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,have not been here in a long time so when i came by today it felt like i was coming home i used to be here almost   times a week so it is nice to see some familiar faces still running this joint the mi latte is a big dollop of wonderful besides the good food the coffee here is exceptional the staff do their best and it is situated in a wonderful area in singapore full of culture and atmosphere right across the cafe is the malay heritage centre which has a sprawling garden serenely situated within this district taking a stroll within the compound after your coffee break at maison ikkoku is as simple as walking across worth coming here during a lazy afternoon just note that weekends are extremely crowded during brunch time and most seats are usually taken up they take reservations as well but call early oh my recommendation try their own in store crafted tiramisu cake it is delectable and delightful,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,loved this place the brunch was one of the best i have had and the eggs were absolute perfection we also ordered the french toast which was a nice sweet treat we came early on a saturday morning most tables were reserved however we were able to find a spare one easily the service was quick and the food beyond delicious very happy with the prices,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,the coffee tho i have been heading to mi for at least  years now and it is never disappointed heck i have brought at least  to  different groups of friends and they have all loved it as much although i have to add the quality of coffee you get at mi differs according to the barista making it plus the food used to be terrific and extremely value for money sadly in recent months years standards seem to have taken a hit and prices have only inflated tip if you are driving do not scrimp on a parking coupon the parking wardens are relentless around this area,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,great coffee place trendy in malay kampong glam area good sandwiches innovative combinations and cakes relatively expensive  sandwiches  capuccinos and  fresh orange juices will set you back about sgd but very good quality will definitely return on my short list now for breakfast brunch lunch in sg,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,seems like there was a change of management same old place different standards of coffee sub par on some days real bad on others inconsistent music selection seems like classic rock and boybands are put on strict rotation cringe on the topic of music why am i made to feel like i need to shout in here to have a decent conversation with friends just decide if you want to be a speciality coffee shop or an ah beng ktv already bad music on full blast every single time we have had to tell the staff to tone it down but most of the time they seem too preoccupied with singing along and clowning around with their posse to even care about service what happened to the good ol days maison you have managed to turn a good thing bad congratulations for a while we were on the fence but i think we can safely write you off now r i p,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,i went here for the valentine is day special which was a  course meal everything was wrong my girlfriend and i arrived at  pm for an   reservation we were told immediately that they needed  min to clean and prepare for us  minutes later we were seated it took  minutes of that to get a drink and a water while we waited the staff was confused as what to do someone said we needed to wait downstairs but we were were sent upstairs by another staff member the  courses were being rushed out they took  seconds to eat but took another  minutes at least for the next course and the food was not even close to being worth the price of over  for  the place was packed and the seating was minimal they were obviously overbooked and unprepared i do not think we will be going back anytime soon the drink i received from the mixologist was the only bright spot,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this intimate spot is proud of its cocktails and for good reason expect a consistently tasty drink and spectacular presentation,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this place has a really laid back indie vibe slightly off the beaten track with warm orange lighting and chilled out tunes in the background it calls for a nice lazy afternoon with a cup of well brewed coffee and maybe some cake if i had my way i tried their pumpkin cheesecake and was pretty impressed on my first taste of it i could taste the pumpkin though the cheese and the nutty crust brilliant it was however a little too heavy for me towards the end well that is partially my fault for being too greedy anyway their coffee was pretty good smooth and velvety just what i needed for a rainy afternoon i went up to the roof top bar to have a look but it was closed in the day perhaps this place beckons for another visit at night,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this place is definitely one of the cafes in singapore that i loved they had a good brunch menu and also had free wifi i love arab street and haji lane and hence its location was perfect for me to spend tea time here and head out to dinner afterwards at one of the muslim places in arab street it is perfect if you want to meet a friend to catch up of tea coffee,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,what i love as much as this place has  levels the cafe the store and the bar on the rd rooftop i am only gonna comment on the bar as that is the place i love love love to the core it is quite the climb but it is worth it once you get up the view is amazing of the beautiful sultan mosque with the glittering gold domes and with a few drinks you almost feel like you are not in singapore anymore i almost feel like i am istanbul looking out the ambiance is chic the tables outside on the deck are my fave but the ones inside are nice if you want air conditioning must haves the smoked goose omg i cannot even describe this the drinks are amazing i think they have a menu but i always just tell the waiter what i feel like having something not too sweet refreshing and strong and they will whip up something for you makes it kinda exciting their drinks are visually orgasmic with very elaborate designs and very artistic interpretations of the traditional cocktail i had like   drinks there last friday and had a blast go with friends and enjoy the hipster chic arab street what i do not love drink are   a pop so errr yeah,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,my friend and i literally stumbled across this lovely place yesterday and boy it was such a gem amazing bartender matteo was so attentive with incredible craft cocktails and beautiful prosecco we were not intending to stay long but the food booze and great company kept us all night we had a fresh irish oysters to start and insanely great maguey carpaccio with out of world virgin olive oils and sea salt the dish called nest was delish as well with an interesting twist of chawanmushi with mozzarella cheese love love loved it i cannot wait for my next visit,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,i used to love coming to this place because the coffee and food was good but had the most horrible experience today i went there to buy coffee with a friend as usual my friend had commented that her loyalty card had disappeared once new management took over and the girl was very defensive and unapologetic then turned to me and basically said you do not want coffee right that is fine you can go i was struck by how dismissive unfriendly unapologetic and rude she was and can not believe her attitude towards the customers of course i did not order any coffee after that and will not be coming back again unless something changes extremely disappointed,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,ikkoku definitely has national best worthy potential along all the dimensions it offers coffee food cocktails enough skill to be worthy of  i am docking one for high prices and their inability to keep up service quality when the place is full and somewhat because the location is annoying to get to as well as being quite nice none of these except lack of scalability is worthy of a star by itself but they add up the coffee is very very good in fact i used to trek there to get my beans because they get the roast amongst the most right of all the roasters in singapore it is a light roast of single origins with very nutty tones think colombian which is perfect for long drinks price is in line with hipster coffee places at  for a cold drip the food is best defined as quality tiny portions at exorbitant prices  for a bit of cheese and  crackers is ridiculous but it is a hip place the customer base is probably trying to keep under their calorie limits i try to eat before going there even though it is pretty good stuff the cocktails are precise and well balanced what i wonder is how much of that is bartender skill and how much is recipes and good quality control nothing wrong with the latter but the prices seem to be marked up to levels implying the former if ah sam can offer bespoke cocktails and chuck  attempts down the drain before offering you something they are happy with for only  the more than  charged by ikkoku is a bit ridiculous it is also worth noting that you take a risk by letting them go wild occasionally you get a dud our berry mojito was not that different from a dragonfruit flavour vitaminwater but that is part of the game no risk no gain i do wonder what the ice is made of the smell of the water from the melting ice definitely reminded me of macritchie reservoir again at that price point i would expect using something other than tap water in delicately balanced cocktails or at least filter it what annoyed me is that i once asked for a variation on a classic cocktail instead of sticking with giving them a mood and getting something created and they made a bit of a fuss about it implying i did not trust them or something on the contrary a true artist works best within constraints cf what helmut newton is victims said of sessions with him which were dictatorial a classic sour for example is all about balancing the sour sweet and booze taste wise and texturally the egg white which they did impeccably a sazerac is the hardest of all as too much absinthe results in basically an aniseed short drink and too little and you have something resembling an old fashioned the location is alright sandwiched between shophouses and with a magnificent view from the garden over the sultan mosque which has just been renovated bit far from public transport by foot on a normal i e not full day the prices are somewhat justified by the competent and personalized service and peaceful interior then we made the mistake of coming on the chillax anniversary night where something like  amex card holders poured onto a small number of bars to test the resilience and scalability of the teams on duty that night once we got there and somehow secured a table the team cranked up the music to painful levels to stop people lingering and clear space for more of the mobs so much so that we on outside tables kept closing the door to try and preserve our eardrums it then took them  minutes to take our order and around h to deliver the cocktails this is the downside of hand crafting every order scalability is almost impossible we moved on to auld alliance which had no issue with the chillax crowds thanks to having both ample amounts of staff at hand and serving whisky instead of cocktails which take less effort to serve if chillax had been my only experience of ikkoku i would never come back the thing is at this price point i do not bother going to ikkoku anymore anyway sure it is good but the stack of small risks and issues just make it hard to find the willpower to make the effort particularly if the night will be crowded there is plenty of competition in town,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,very delicious  buck cup of mocha i did not eat anything here just sat alone with my hot cup of mocha surrounded by couples and groups of friends chatting about weekend plans and other activities yep just me and my  dollar cup of coffee it was good but maybe i will drag the princess here with me next time but she is only  years old and probably should not drink coffee,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,i was here on a saturday morning for brunch in the cafe downstairs what struck me about the place at first was the decor beautifully simple it was furnished with eclectic pieces of furniture i settled down ordered the break of dawn and a latte the orders came quick served with a smile i would have to say the fare is simple but delicious helpings are okay i would definitely come by again and check out the bar that exists on the rd floor,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,all i had in mind yesterday afternoon was spam musubi spam topping a log of japanese short grained rice mixed with furikake a lovely mix of texture and flavour i really appreciated how they offered to warm it up as i was having it to go musubi latte perfect pre dinner snack i will be back there was a orh nee yam paste cheesecake sitting in the refrigerated case calling my name,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,seinen manga nerds you have come to the wrong spot unless of course you are looking for delicious coffee fast free internet and a delicious hot brekkie think sea salt caramel french toast with cinnamon and sour cream in which case you could not have picked a better place welcome in maison ikkoku is somewhere i come on each visit to singapore whether it be for the downstairs cafe with their gorgeous coffee or the upstairs rooftop bar with one of my favourite views in the city i have even picked up a beautiful tie for my other half in the swanky and uber sartorial men is boutique in between you will definitely pay a bit more than you might be used to but with food this fresh and cocktails that are equally delicious you will likely be more willing to dish out,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this spot is houses a cafe on its first level an apparel store on its second and a cocktail on its third this is a great place for a cozy meet up or appointments without formalities it serves pretty good coffee that will work well with most palettes you can try most of the popular beans you will probably need to try at this spot if you are down on a hot day i will recommend their cold drip or iced long black skip the syrup please they have really good desserts to accompany the coffee so you may like to leave some space for your sweet tooth when you are down a winner on their menu is their mi spam misubi which is a dish brought forward by one of the co owner days in haiwaii it is really addictive sushi made up of long grain rice and a piece of spam luncheon meat on top i love their apparel store as it features male clothes from japan london etc very edgy range with a nice attention to details,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,i cannot comment on the food here as this is not what i dropped in for it was the extensive coffee menu that caught my attention on a steamy hot singapore day a big cold glass of cold drip went down a treat they have a wide range of brew method options v syphon etc and some pretty impressive looking cakes in the cabinet some of the tables were marked reserved and it appears to get quite busy during brunch period so if you are after a meal it might pay to call ahead,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,great coffee good food very good cocktails in the evenings free wifi what is there not to like i love that the place is named for a fictional boarding house in a manga series and that somebody thought it was a good idea to combine a coffee shop boutique and rooftop cocktail bar it really really is,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,maison ikkoku is a chic little concept store made up of cafe level  shop level  and mixology bar level  and unfortunately for the ladies dedicated solely to chic men is wear but do not despair you can rock the androgynous look or covet the cool bags or live vicariously by shopping for your partners here it is mostly designer wear from usa and japan so it is a bit pricier i did not have time to visit the cafe or bar on the first and third levels but it does sound like somewhere i want to go back to again,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,i love everything about maison ikkoku which is also part of a concept store on the nd floor and a bar on the rd they have a great ambience and your tables are made out of old recycled doors or cupboard doors old shelves are also nailed to the celing giving a vey odd impression that they are falling through the ceiling somehow the coffee here is fantastic i always order the latte or the mi signature latte they use a fragrant blend of beans that i can enjoy without sugar for those who are not crazy about coffee you can also order the chai tea which i find good but a little too sweet for my palate the cakes here are also worth mentioning my favourites were the pumpkin cheese cake which was light and not too heavy and the red velvet cake topped with cream cheese icing walnuts and comes in a gloriously large slice they have great sandwiches here at affordable rates i found them so big a friend and i could share one they use good freshly baked bread and quality ingredients for their sandwiches i have also tried the eggs benedict on their weekend brunch menu and enjoyed it i will definitely head back to try their other coffees and dishes it is mostly street parking around here so good luck at peak hours this area is also notorious for the summons people loitering about and giving tickets so it is best not to risk an illegal park there is also a wait list for tables sometimes especially on weekends but i have not had to wait for more than  minutes before,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,maison ikkoku is the only place in singapore where i will order espresso based coffee after weeks of hunting around the city for a decent espresso based coffee i mostly gave up the stuff you get from starbucks coffee connoisseur tea leaf bean and similar is junk usually watery tepid and bitter mostly i got comfortable with the kopi houses all over singapore for my caffeine fix it is a very different kind of drink but once you get used to it i found it to be a better option than the other coffee available anyway back to maison ikkuku this is the place i visit on the weekend when i want to have a real coffee fresh ground beans well roasted and made properly with a decent espresso machine operated by people that know what they are doing best coffee i have had in singapore i gave it  stars because even though it is the best it is not comparable to what is available in melbourne,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,passed by this morning and remembered the good reviews i read on yelp and decided to give it a try i got the flat white to go since i was in a hurry it is a little pricey s  considering i can get a good kopi generally for s  but the coffee was good also like their outdoor tables made from a recycled door,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this caf takes coffee very seriously they even have diagrams and descriptions of how each cup is made the fit out is very cool and very new york the furniture fixed to the ceiling was a bit unsettling at first but you get used to it i appreciated the few salad options on the menu as i hear that it is not always that easy to find salad in singapore overall this is a very cool little place to hang out,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,i am a fan a fan of the bar not the coffee the bar is definitely a must try the bartenders are very well versed with their flavors ingredients i enjoy telling them one or two key ingredients or taste let them mix a cocktail and be surprised of course you can always try their more popular drinks the bloody mary is one of the best in town so are the smoked whiskey chili drinks the service is great everyone is cheerful and friendly the vibe is uplifting cosy for a group of friends to hang out or catch up my only pet peeve is no reservations after  pm but i do understand their point of view i hope for better seating arrangements nevertheless keep up the great work and have more new produce ingredients,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,as i just passed arab street i wanted a coffee and checked on yelp for suggestions maison ikkoku caught my eye because of the cosy and chilled atmosphere however i thought that the service was pretty unfriendly they were all chatting with each other and it felt like i was bothering them with my questions regarding the menu and since i am sensitive to the service it did not make me want to stay i ordered an iced americano to go which was not exceptional alright maybe i will give it another shot,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,did not really get to try their brunch because i missed the timings the place is a little small and was not able to enjoy myself there because there was a constant crowd that adds pressure to make you leave instead of chilling and just hanging out with your friends there staff are generally quite friendly though choice of timing to visit quite crucial i feel,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,we came here for brunch on the weekend had a pm reservation for  it was crowded and a bit cramped especially since we were sitting at the table by the door there is a bit of self service you have to go to the counter to order and pour your own water but they do bring you your food and are pretty attentive about taking finished plates away since there was barely enough space on the table made from recycling old doors my husband and i ordered the smoked salmon scrambled mainly for the guacamole that came with it and the french toast with caramelized bananas both were good not to die for but definitely good for the first time in singapore i had a version of spam musubi with real spam at  it was a bit overpriced for its small size but it satisfied my craving the few places that sold musubi used generic spam my caramel latte was much better than i expected not too sweet but the coffee was strong and flavorful definitely not your average brucnh latte our friends ordered a side of potatoes and it was a lot smaller than we expected it came in the same sauce like container the guacamole came in it made the musubi for  look like a good deal haha two of us ordered the specialty coffee drinks and although they were good they were not as unique tasting as my latte overall this place is cute including the street it is on and the food wo not disappoint,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,went on a friday night and had an ok time service was very good i must say that but my cocktails were again strictly ok i had  in total with a rum base and finished with a white wine base nothing tasted any different from what i have had before and for  dollars a cocktail i was not impressed though i must say a friends of mine who just told the bartender to surprise her did get good cocktails maybe i will use that phrase next time,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,coming here for  days straight this week but their coffee tastes a bit sour i do not know if they change their coffee beans recently or they just hire a new barista who is not experienced enough to handle their strada machine but i do think their coffee standard drops i used to love coming here for my caffeine fix bc of its proximity to my office but now i would have to think again to come back for their coffee and maybe for their mains,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,have not had the food but the coffee is on point some of the best espresso based drinks i have had in singapore the mason jar tiramisu was good too,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,all day breakfast had the big one lovely and imaginative well prepared and good vaiue they do coffee prepared every way you can imagine pour over press aeropress suction you name it so you get to try different ways to see what you like excellent coffee though the wife is latte was a bit too sweet for my taste worth a stop if you are around arab street did not try the roof cocktails but will definitely be back for another breakfast and coffee,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this is the place to head to if you want to break free from the mediterranean saturated arab st and you happen to be in the area it is probably the only place of its kind in that enclave i was looking for a good coffee boost but did not want to have turkish coffee so my friend brought me to this place it is along the row of shophouses just opposite the malay heritage centre it is got a very welcoming cozy vibe the kind that invites you to just hang out here for hours i ordered an iced latte loved how it was served in a generous portion of a jar and had a red velvet indeed i got the coffee boost i wanted and more the coffee was beautifully prepared with alot of love the red velvet was a nice accompaniment though it was quite a huge slice that i could not finish it have not been to the other floors of this place but definitely have become enough of a fan of the cafe to check the rest of the place out final verdict a good break from middle eastern food and atmosphere of arab st,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this place is kinda like a department store but way way way cooler great aesthetics link all three floors and it is one place i can actually can get something read spend money on every floor on the ground the cafe serves up some serious coffee manager rizuan roasts the beans himself and the baristas all have experience get welly to pour you a signature mi latte he is pretty good heck even the chef is a bit of a barista himself oh and the food is pretty good too try the weekend brunches or grab a musubi if you are in a hurry spam on sushi rice yeah second level houses a menswear boutique cult brands decent selection i have been making eyes at some miansai accessories for ages picked up some twins for peace shoes instead firstworldproblemstop floor is a boutique cocktail bar now if you remember a mixologist called leslie who used to be at another bar a couple streets away i found him he is a smooth operator and he is got a wealth of experience test him for as much as your cocktail is worth,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,there is a stark contrast between old and new taking place in maison ikkoku on a quiet side street the calm of a quiet saturday afternoon is broken by the hum of conversation and the hiss of milk being steamed under pressure the painted brick walls with industrial style copper pipes and light fixtures are far removed from the original shophouse that was here and are closer to a contemporary urban studio apartment there are some quirky touches also with old pieces of furniture suspended from the walls and doors recycled into tables on an outdoor terrace an espresso shot is the foundation of many different coffees it is hard to make a bad drink with a good espresso and so much easier to make a bad drink with an over extracted shot the espresso shot that i ordered arrived with a medium dark brown crema and a small volume of coffee the crema colour is an indicator of freshness if it is pale it is stale which is why i always make a note of this the small volume suggests that the shot was not over extracted which would give rise to unpleasant flavours in the shot as non soluble coffee grounds end up in the cup it was bitter with hints of woody flavours and a slightly thick mouthfeel the aftertaste was bold and lasting overall a well executed espresso so far so good i ordered a latte also the espresso was definitely muted by the milk it was smooth with the coffee flavour not lost or drowned out by the milk however the overall quality is reduced by the presence of larger bubbles in the milk foam this is something that i have seen before in maison ikkoku this might seem like the most minor and insignificant point imaginable but there are valid underlying reasons for pointing this out larger bubbles do not impart the same silky smooth mouthfeel that microfoam does also the baristas have gone to the effort of creating latte art unfortunately larger bubbles cause the foam to break apart so the overall affect is lost after a few minutes this is something that is fixable and it is a shame to see their efforts go to waste for the sake of a small change to the steaming technique it is also the difference between a very good latte and an average one one thing to bear in mind however the point above is simply not relevant for anyone who prefers drip or brewed coffee and might not even be an issue for anyone else there is also a good selection of brewed and drip coffees available for anyone with different tastes pourover coffees are on the menu along with cold dripped syphon aeropress andv all available as options coffee choices include pretty much everything except ristretto shots that is ok though there is more than enough on offer one thing that maison ikkoku does well is the pairing of different bean types to different brewing methods and the baristas are well versed in which method to pair to which bean this is great to see and speaks volumes about the cafe and the owners intentions and reasons for starting prices as are expected   for the latte and cappuccino above and broadly in line with what is charged in other quality cafes along with smitten and chye seng huat hardware maison ikkoku has a very well stocked retail section with accessories that are not always found elsewhere there is a good selection of items for brewed or filtered coffees including chemex and v coffee drippers cone filters and syphons there are also tampers on sale for home baristas unfortunately maison ikkoku does not sell coffee beans this is something that i would like to see happen as there are some interesting blends and single origins from columbia and el salvador being used overall  stars as the selection of brewing methods available and the quality of espresso makes up for the steaming issue described above which will not affect everyone but it is unfortunate to see this when everything else is done so well also maison ikkoku can be very crowded at weekends with queues for seats opening the second floor cocktail bar during the day would help to alleviate this it is certainly worth a visit and along with symmetry and espressolab is a good choice for anyone craving caffeine in the arab street area,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this place knows some of my exes and the some cocktails i love most,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,the good cafe fantastic coffee atmosphere music service staff food location in that order this place rates as my all around favorite cafe in sg boutique great japanese brands mostly for men bought a few things decent options and easy to chat with staff great way kill time while waiting for a table bar friendly and skilled bartender tasty tasty drinks nd favorite cocktail bar in singapore tippling club reigns as  no surprise there the bad cafe food has taken a nosedive since opening change in chef recipe something is off because before it was the best eggs benedict and now it is just average tiramisu is to die for literally gave me and my friend a stomach ache always crowded so be prepared to wait boutique would love more options sizes bar a bit too congested and pricey need cheap beer options have not been in awhile i hope they added a free self serve water option because it was not there before the ugly if the drop in food quality is any indication this could be one of those great venues that gets popular and forgets about the little things that made it so i am optimistic though because it seems that the staff actually cares,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,omg love the drinks here its one of those do not have a menu but tell me what you want type of speakeasy ish bars while the decor is not that of a speakeasy the drinks are the classy types that reminds you of one try to go early on a random week day to get a seat at the bar so you can see the amount of care and skill that goes into each drink i love watching the mixologist okay not just bartenders but this is some classy stuff so mixologists it is going at it with each drink pounding away on the berries cucumbers for super fresh flavors slapping the mint not just ripping it up like how ppl usually do but slapping it and lighting up rosemary on fire for extra flavoring and a show drinks are amazing here the only time i have had to have something re done was for maison is version of a bloody mary it was not that it was bad but it was just too spicy overall i always have a great time here chill vibe classy music and decor and most importantly each drink makes me feel so special it is a big plus that the mixologists are super nice and friendly chats away with you and explains things to you if you are curious you must hit up this place if you are in town,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,they make drinks from all fresh vegetables and fruits had the bloody mary and it is amazing,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,poor customer service mosquito flying around ur cake dont know if they even open air condition,Negative
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,excellent coffee and brunch items the actual seating area that is next to the coffee counter is very small and cramped so go early or expect to wait i like there house special brew but they have the usual other options worth a visit if you are around arab or kanadahar street in singapore,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,top notch coffee in a trendy part of town free fast wifi and nice interior,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,this is a cool place to hang out with friends always crowded during weekends but adds to the atmosphere food is quite good too highly recommended,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,do not particularly like the design or atmosphere of this place but the coffee is good and the food is good and the service is good generally it is a great place for a good study session,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,one of coolest place in town the cocktail at the terrace are just amazing top quality try the one with coffe omg blow u away,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,there has been a trend in the last couple years of converting shophouses into amazing little restaurants my favorite in this genre recently is maison ikkoku not only is the building itself gorgeous but the interior use of space and design compliments it well my husband and i stopped in for a late lunch last sunday and the place was packed so be prepared for the wait there are plenty of magazines to accommodate that or you could leave your number and have them call you when we sat down the waiters were attentive and took our order quickly i had the umami florentine and c had a croquet madame he said it was the best he has ever had which is saying something while i loved my mushroomy eggs florentine i thought the hollandaise sauce was a tad on the mustardy side i would like to try the salmon version next we could order everything at once and they held off making our coffee until we were done with our meal that latte was so good it almost had a nutty flavor i am guessing it is the way they roast the beans they also are hitting on the trend of offering a ton of different coffee preparation styles french press vacuum whatever c is coffee was superb the only downside to this fabulous little eatery is that we felt bad holding the table so we quickly sipped our coffee and skedaddled i am totally going back next weekend,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,the sandwich salad drink combo for lunch is great love the sandwiches and salads,Positive
maison-ikkoku-restaurant-and-bar,i do not drink much coffee so i feel like i am kinda missing out on the whole point of this place that said it is got a really chill vibe perfect for lazy weekends the red velvet cake was good,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,nothing can beat handmade croissants with homemade pandan egg custard jam free from the condiment bar we have been going back to this place every time we are in singapore located in quiet neighborhood worth checking the shops around the bakery store,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,if you are desperate for a good french croissant tiong bahru nails it it is fluffy inside has crisp outer layers that fall apart into flakes when torn apart and your fingers get a little greasy my daughter loved it too i tasted their croissant at their safari location such a cute ambiance and had a few other classic french items there hence the determination to go to the original location this bakery is a stone is throw away from tiong bahru food centre so if you are in the neighborhood do stop by stick to the classics plain croissant latte cannele and save yourself some dough haha from the expensive items on the pastry display case i tried a flawless looking chocolate eclair s   but was a bit disappointed when i bit into it the custard was nice tasting but the outside did not taste fresh things took a downturn when i received my iced earl grey lavender latte because it arrived with just plain  tea bags did i just pay s   for iced tea i asked the lady who brought my tea to confirm this is my order she came back to say this is correct last time i checked a latte comes with milk should i have brought my own also do note that even if you purchase items for take away you still get charged for the  cover charge this place was named best french bakery in singapore i highly doubt it,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,neither my kouign amann nor my green tea croissant were as up to snuff as snob carb moi expected the expectations were much too high certainly the ones i have had in other places had better buttery lamination with good flavor the ka simply was not buttery or fluffy enough sounds funny that a ka could actually not be buttery enuf and the caramel y bit was amiss not cheap prices just expected more places like b and arcisault and tartine are my benchmark comparisons,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,let me begin by saying this is a small neighborhood establishment it opens at   am me and my friend decide to get there before the opening because we had an engagement which required us to leave the hotel at   am we showed up at   am and there was already a queue this tells you how good this place is taking a hint from the french patisseries this establishment is quaint and comfortable typical of its european model the individual comes in grabs a danish or a breaded product with a cappuccino and makes their way towards the beginning of a new day i cannot say enough about how good the bread is in this place the almond croissant stole the day it is crispy sweet base contrasted delightfully with it is flaky soft body i almost wish i had purchased two of them the apple my apologies that i did not get the full name of it also had that sweet succulent flavor combined with the flaky bread crust the ham and cheese croissant would have been stupendous except the ham selection left a lot to be desired whenever i am in singapore i will make it my business to show up at this establishment in order to enjoy it is fattening but delightful,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,i set my expectations too high for a high end bakery named after the hipster neighborhood it is in when i arrived  minutes before closing time i was hit with a nice gust of ac as expected options were limited i expected some sort of discount as many bakeries do near closing time but they did not have after i settled on the mille feuille the older woman behind the counter said it was   the display had said   so i asked her if she charged me the dine in price instead of just answering me she snarkily started explaining that here in singapore they have to pay a thing called gst to their government and this money does not go to them i said yes i have been in singapore for  months already and that was not my question i want to know if you know mine is to go then she said you should know that already then who talks like that to a customer overpaying for your pastry eventually i figured it out and said oh i see that gst is not included in the price although sometimes it already is but speaking of the mille feuille it was such a letdown the cream had barely any flavor and the puff pastry layers were bland too leaning on the salty side the highlight of this dessert was literally the raspberries,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,really awesome bakery in a young kinda hipster neighborhood of singapore make sure to walk around and check out stores bookshops murals the croissant was heavenly but i think my favorite part was the creams and jams available in little pots i was able to put as much nutella as i wanted on my croissant which made me quite happy def take advantage,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,amazing place for breakfast nothing short of perfection the latte i ordered was flawless and the salmon spinach quiche was simply delightful i found nothing wrong with this place it was not crowded extremely clean and the staff was engaging during our visit i think a return visit is mandatory,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,we definitely over carb ed here lol trying everything and being two people but one life no regrets came on a weekend and everyone was there so super hard to get a table we waited a bit the traffic was just flowing with ppl buying pastries and coffee some to go and some to stay we bought a bunch of goodies then ate it then more goodies,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,alway a lime at this outlet at lunch time good quality sandwiches and croissants almond croissant was a little heavy some sweet thing stuffed inside that makes it a bit jelat coffee is strong friendly service systematic way of dealing with the crowd from the notice board i found that they have another  gluten free cafe called the butcher is wife which is about  minutes from this cafe,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,this is a really nice little bakery they have many pastry selections as well as coffee to choose from the cinnamon chocolate swirl that i ordered was nice and flaky and tasted good although the mocha that i had ordered was okay,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,great bakery with air conditioning and nice indoor seating enjoyed a kouign amman and cappuccino here and a great start to the day,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,green tea almond croissant    starsmuch better than i last remember reviewed and probably one of the best croissants i have had in singapore would love for it to be a bit less sweet though,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,delicious pastry i have tried many different bakeries and out of all the locations this is the best i cannot remember the names of the pastries i ate but i have photos these are the most popular and best selling items in the store crispy outside and so soft inside also their coffee is so good this is not normal coffee just to give you an idea starbucks coffee level  coffee from here is level  coffees are specially brewed by barista to perfection it takes time to receive the order but worth it i also ordered ice chocolate glass bottle drink because i love the bottle not only the bottle looks pretty taste is even better very deep rich taste employee told me these are made and prepared daily very good but expensive compare to other items next time i should try their fresh juice,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,famous bakery chain in singapore known for its croissant the croissant is the heavy dense kind as opposed to the soft airy flaky one the croissant is rich and guiltily good the other signature item i would recommend is the krouig amman though a tad bit sweet the crispiness of the pastry goes very well with the sugary filling which seeps through each layer of the pastry other dessert items are so so one comment is the quality is a bit inconsistent across branches the best one is at the original tiong bahru branch tried it at another outpost but they slightly overbake burnt the croissant,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,the baked goods and sandwiches are top quality coffee is too but they only have medium roast beans this is asia and they like it medium i preferred dark roast and i would rate this bakery a  star the teh tarik is one of the best that i have had and the first that i have seen with latte art this would be an awesome beverage if they make the tea a bit stronger,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,yes it is as good as the hype take it from a pastry hating sweet tooth lacking miser even though the almond chocolate croissants are over  they are worth it their flaky outside somehow holds a thick kind of gooey but not cloying center outlined in good rich dark chocolate the paper bag is hefty in your hand when you carry it out felt like a good pound,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,amazing croissants and beverages croissants were the right amount of sweet and their flavoring pleasant and not overpowering similar could be said of the tea coffee and hot chocolate,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,very nice bakery just outside the hawker center nice place to cool off from the heat once you have had your hawker center fare i was very impressed with their latte art nice selection of pastries and baked goods too,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,this was one of my top places i wanted to check out while i was in singapore i thought that tiong bahru bakery was good but not great the options are fairly limited and because their items are pre made and i was told there are no chefs behind the kitchen during working hours then they do not do any substitutions or adjust menu items for example they sell croissants and have boiled eggs in another menu item but they could not sell it to me together i had ordered the quiche lorraine croissant and apple kouign amann to share with my mom the croissant was okay nothing really special the kouign amani and quiche were fantastic very flavorful i also felt in comparison to all of the other places in singapore the service was lacking the waitress was not very attentive she would forget things or ignore us and the tables next to us regardless of those details the kouign amann and quiche earned the four stars,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,this place was right next yo my hotel lucky me ofcourse i got the croissant yummy they are really soft and chewy not like typical croissants i got the plain one with hot chocolate with soy milk i got these  days back to back i will likely go back for the hot chocolate but i had to say to myself self you cannot eat croissants every day while you are in singapore so today i will go elsewhere the store itself it is moderately sized i really like the door staff there are pleasant,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,i travel a lot and am always on the search for the perfect croissant it is half a world away from where i live us but i found it in singapore in this great bakery who would have thought,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,nice place to sit down for an expensive cup of joe or pastry and pretend like you are hipster yet chic minus one star for no wi fi,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,espresso is not bad actually i am assuming they are sourcing from common man because they had boxes with their logo anywho i feel the style is a little dated maybe  years ago it would have been hipster heaven cons no wifi which is sort of understandable as people will camp out the major sin is the inedible pastry i ordered seriously very old are they dumpster diving outside other cafes,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,definitely a popular spot for people to hangout i found it a little expensive for certain items and their pastry selection was good croissants are kind of flaky and apple kouign amann was a little too sweet but a good consistency and taste i would say the atmosphere was quaint and pleasant the people working seemed nice although there was a customer in front of me and that was unsure of what to order and the server kind of seemed annoyed the bakery was okay but if i was not in the area i do not think i would travel just to go there tip  go earlier to have more selection tip  if you are unsure of what to get many people try their almond croissant and their coffee,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,cool offthey make  of the best coffees in singapore and great pastry and cake their savoury not so good no real selection of cold drinks only  to select from so that was a bit strange on the upside this place is freezing inside it is the first proper air conditioned establishment i have found here so go in an cool off i love the neighbourhood very hip n happening my mate lives upstairs so i like to visit and hang out here great for people watching because of their cold drink situation i usually go to the market that you can see from the door take the escalator up and on your left you will see the fresh juice lady i grab a large watermellon juice   then go for coffee and cake,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,can here for the first time today as i have heard so much about this place could only try one thing as it was post lunch dessert the vanilla millefeuille was definitely the right choice it was difficult to cut so we had to resort to using our hands but it was heaven in every mouthful the sweetness was just right the vanilla cream just melts in your mouth and the the biscuity puffs sandwiching it were a perfect complement my latte was alright have had better coffee elsewhere ambiance is so so would be nicer if the staff made sure all the tabletops were clean after customers leave but if you are just grabbing and going nothing to concern you about i also bought some kouign amanns to go will update again if i end up being the one eating them,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,i have not reviewed this place yet well i am trying to hide this from all of you here this place is crowded in the weekend as people from all walk of life come here for a cuppa of coffee and some delicious croissants in the weekday is mornings thankfully it is not as packed but it is still buzzing i wonder why people do not have to work and hang out at coffeeshop all the time the bakery is good though i chance upon quite a disappointing macha croissant today just order the original croissant will do the kouign amann is also good but a lil too sweet overall i like this joint better than the one at city hall as it is more quaint because it is located within the hip tiong bahru neighbourhood,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,described as the tartine bakery of singapore i went here a few times i gotta say i never liked the coffee but the sweet pastries were good if you are into that kinda thing but i did just enjoy the plain croissant enjoy the funky center hinge door when you go,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,recently tried their new savoury croissants speaking of the rolling dumpling i would not have guess that it was inspired from xiao long bao if not for the menu description as it lacked the distinctive traits of this classic chinese dumpling such as the slurpy pork broth yes there were pickled ginger and succulent minced meat but the black vinegar dressing could not lift up the dish nonetheless the sparkling chemistry between the subtly spiced chorizos and the sweet caramelized onion jam in the flying pig left me clamouring for more its miso dressing did not overpower the dish and i would not even mind if the sausage was spammed with even more of the tasty onion relish on top as a person with a soft spot for fish i thought i would love the jumping fish the most but it turned out otherwise a bite into this voluptuous croissant revealed an oasis of minced spinach and salmon filling the smoked salmon was not too salty but the filling which reminded me of the classic greek pie spanakopita needed a shake of herbs to bring it to life another calorie worthy croissant is the running egg that was garnished with non heady japanese spicy flakes while ramen egg gurus might insist that the molten egg yolk could be more gooey i thought the current consistency worked well with the bonito flakes and mayonnaise sauce which contributed to the tasty umami flavours prepared fresh in batches and kept warm in hotboxes to retain the temperature all the croissants except for the ramen egg are baked together with the ingredients this results in a croissant dough that are more moist and chewy while the external layer retains a delightful crunch each croissant is retailing at   each or you can select any two flavours to go with the tangy salad with yuzu dressing dried cranberry and mixed seeds for  my suggestion is to enjoy these savoury croissants at the outlets where they are served piping hot and fresh from the oven it is alright if your stomach acknowledged the aroma of caramelized butter by making some embarrassing growls in public mine did but so did everyone,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,there are many awesome bakeries and cafes in tiong bahru but none are as packed as this one this is both the upside and downside of this local bakery the constant line and flow of people means they are always putting out fresh goodies and pastries and even the displayed cakes are not laying around for long on the downside it is rather difficult to find a place to sit especially on the weekends and lunch time with that said tiong bahru bakery is worth a visit as they have many original pastries cakes and even savory treats including one of my favorites the squid ink bun when i lived in tiong bahru and even now it is one of my favorite breakfast cafes,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,ordered a chocolate and almond croissant as well as ice chocolate the ice chocolate is very chocolate which is great this is by far the best ice chocolates i have ever had beside la galate de paris which is just awesome to have something so close to perfection they do use real melted chocolate instead of chocolate syrup which jc quite rare to find in just any cafe around singapore as for the croissant it is buttery melt in your mouth buttery it came very close to what i have had by a professional pastry chef all in all because it is too damn close but as i said it is close but not quite therefore it might be the best for sunday times but not really for me i have had better sad enough i have had better,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,after a disappointing chai we stopped by tbb thinking we could at least rely on an oldie the crumble seemed to have dropped in standard the filling of fruit was barely there and the layer of crumble was so hard,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,the bakery in tiong bahru is almost always packed with people and i would say it is for a good reason they have an excellent selection of different pastries to satisfy your sweet tooth my clear favorite is their almond croissant it is a bit different than most other croissants as it is bigger heavier and has a slightly more dense feel to it the generous filling of almond does however make it really nice most of the other pasties i have tried have also been very good as well as some of the savory croissants as well they do also sell are gular bread but actually never tried any of it but it does look nice they serve pretty good coffee as well from  hands and the teas are also nice i also like that they manage to keep things moving smoothly despite the place being full and the service is with a smile,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,decided to check out the place with the hype among singaporeans i was pretty excited the moment i stepped into the little store got served by this awesome waiter who tries very hard to ensure customers do not wait for too long for their seats thumbs up queued and order a chocolate croissant pandan croissant and kouign aman the overwhelming buttery taste of the croissants were so good i had this infusion of butter in my blood kinda feeling after my breakfast if you know what i mean the chocolate croissant has a really thin layer of chocolate in appearance but the taste of chocolate was really strong pretty delighted with that pandan to me it is a very localized flavour and i like the idea of it it gave croissant a different punch in fragrance worth a try kouign aman was my companion is favourite as it is salted caramel flavoured bread infused with salted butter and caramelized sugar overall taste of the breads were really good had a latte and received a fantastic latte art the sight of it makes me love the cup of latte i was holding on to taste awesome the bad side over priced totally over priced even the coffee is over priced my first bite into the cold breads in the morning was a huge disappointment i was expecting the bread to be at least warm all my  breads that i ordered were served cold all in all it was only a ok for me too much a hype,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,the pastry i had the kouign aman think of a light croissant crispy buttery layers topped with salt and caramel more tasty than their plain croissant and not too sweet which i liked they also provided an assortment of fruity jams at the side self service i picked a dark pump colored one which i suspected was a mixture of fig and blueberries the sandwich kh had the speciality bun with bacon and not being a big fan of bacon i only took a small bite out of it it consisted of bacon as its name suggests onions rocket salad and sun dried tomatoes the bacon strip was neither deep fried nor salty but still tasted good a much healthier way of consuming bacon has been invented hurray the bun was really soft and not heated personally i prefer my carbs hot and crusty but this was ok too the beverage the coffee was divine probably the best part of my meal i had a simple latte later i learnt that the coffee was provided by forty hands also part of the food collective owned by spa esprit group fun fact this is the same group behind the concept of house dempsey and skinny pizza both of which i enjoy definitely looking forward to checking out their other food joints that i have not tried like open door policy and forty hands overall    but i cannot seem to do a   on yelp oh wellz  then overall i think it is a pretty decent place for an afternoon tea or a light snack if you are around the area tiong bahru can be pretty far and there is not much to do around there except eat again at other places which we almost did at rachel is outrageous suggestion if our bellies were not at the brink of exploding pictures of the cafe and its food can be found on my website pandarcakes,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,this place has managed to take all of my money since i have started working here as it is a  minute walk from the office this original location has been around for some time and it is still as busy as ever i am amazed at the amount of people who chill here around  am on weekdays both locals and expats i almost want to yell does anyone do any work around here there is a lot of baked goods to choose from but i normally aim to satisfy my sweet tooth by ordering their chocolate croissants their plain croissants are also worth a try as they are super soft flaky and buttery there is also a savoury that i love but it has a french name that i cannot remember all i know is that it smells like pizza and it is delicious i am not sure if they do this all the time but the coffee that they offer is from forty hands as they are related so if you are a fan of the brand you can easily get your fix here the only criticism i have is that the furniture is starting to show some wear and tear if they could just repurpose the chairs and tables perhaps it will give it a less tired look you know i would never do such a thing i am obviously just jealous,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,first breakfast in singapore definitely a great place you can tell the break is freshly made every morning,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,not only are their baguettes possibly the best that you can find in singapore right now but they have also brought the simple art of jambon beurre sandwiches to our island as well one of my favourite staples whenever i am in paris the ones at tiong bahru bakery are the real deal and the two main sandwich ingredients ham and butter are of great quality talk about simple pleasures this is definitely the bakery of the moment so it gets pretty crowded even on weekdays worth a visit and make sure you get one of their baguettes to enjoy back at home as well,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,bewildering i never imagined so many types of bread were possible and is that black bread oh squid ink that is really clever omg tarts and croissants and savouries too with coffee and tea in a pleasant great smelling and great looking french bakery that is quickly gaining popularity judging from the waitlist of people trying to get in this must be what heaven is like and french heaven is just extra sexy these were the first thoughts running through my head when i first saw tiong bahru bakery in the first week of its opening tiong bahru is really getting its hip on there was no doubt i had kouign aman if a croissant and a salted butter sultana got together and had a baby this would be it it was buttery and only slightly sweet and so fluffy i could taste a hint of salt and a bit of heaven life was good there and then to be kind to my waistline i am going to make it a point to try something new every week here instead of doing it all at once and because i just want an excuse to come back all the time coffee was nothing to write about but hey that is not what gontran cherrier is famous for,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,the cafe latte was really really aromatic and rich in taste the milk they used was really good that it did not leave an aftertaste the crossaint was by far the best i have tasted in the long while only gripe is that it is not bigger otherwise its rather creamy and fragrant definitely a must try,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,two words chocolate slipper two more words almond croissant honestly this place is just across the street from my work and i find it hard to not want to devour everything it is a singapore institution and i can see why everything is freshly baked the staff is super friendly and they really know what they are doing big kudos to the team at tbb,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,the latest addition to the quaint tiong bahru area that has seen an explosion of indie coffee joints tiong bahru bakery is the result of a collaboration between french baker and the spa esprit group despite the rather quaint location the bakery is frequented by many and its quite common for it to get packed during lunch serving up a range of pastries and desserts that are all freshly baked to perfection according to the chef is recipes the number one selling item here is the plain croissant while it sounds too basic to be a best seller the flaky and crispy exterior has a soft airy interior that will blow your mind away othermust tries include the kouign aman and chocolate brioche definitely a place to visit but somehow i still prefer maison kayser,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,i have such a nostalgic attachment to tiong bahru bakery it was one of the first cafes i visited when i was rediscovering the new old tiong bahru and i dare anyone to resist their drool inducing displays the coffee infographic menu is the eye catching centre piece of the entire bakery and true enough it was very well made might have something to do with the guys from forty hands unfortunately the both pandan flan did not impress most of their baked goods are priced above  and i was just hoping for that little bit more it is a beautiful space with such a vibrant atmosphere i would be happy to come back and give tbb another go apparently the croissants are legendary,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,got a few desserts and breads and have to say the breads are awesome and some of the desserts look better than they taste lemon tarte is tooooo sour and slippery too bitter,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,coffee is good especially when paired with their pastries and other goodies i found my sweet tooth here do not go pass the kouign amann or the almond croissant sandwiches are good but its their danish that gets me coming back,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,like that ex you can never cut ties with i have a love hate relationship with tiong bahru bakery let is get this clear tiong bahru bakery is expensive whether you think it is worth it is of course up to you but i generally do not think it is the sandwiches are good but cost more than two plates of chicken rice at the market down the street and is not more filling what is worth going for the kouign amann buttery caramel y goodness this is absolutely delicious and the one thing i go back for again and again despite my verbal insistence that i actually boycott the place after a few weeks of having it regularly though i am proud to say that i am finally so over it and managed to stay away for a good  months that all came crashing to an end today after i popped in for a coffee if you did not know tbb is owned by the same company that owns forty hands meaning you know you are going to get a good cup of coffee here it is a little pricey for a is mall cappuccino meaning that coffee here is actually a touch more expensive that most places in the cbd but it is good robust coffee and if you are already overpaying for bread and pastries well you might as well overpay for drinks too right why is it still receiving  stars then why do i go back because it is across the street from my office and it has the best coffee in the area because the quality of what it offers is undeniable they do good shizz but the prices oh the prices,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,i knew this was going to be a interesting meal when i saw the fun front door the line was terribly long on the saturday afternoon we first visited i think everything is pretty tasty but the choice while seemingly extensive is kind of just variations on a theme i would like more diversity in bread products than pastry and sandwiches my iced latte was delicious the guacamole sandwich was tasty but not filling the pear tart should have had more pear the food was only two thirds of the experience because the cafe was so lighthearted and bustling we could not help but have fun i have been back since and enjoy the food but i am still looking for my favorite,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,i am typing this after being done with the salmon and cream cheese bun thing and the pear tart had a flat white as well i must say i had high expectations seeing as to how my friends have raved about this place verdict nahhhhthe salmon was not fresh very unlike the salmon baguette i had at broers cafe and their specialty is not sandwiches and they could have been a bit more generous with the cream cheese the pear tart was okay with the so so hand action could have been sweeter given how the girl asked me would you like any sweets to go with your meal coffee was okay too i guess it could be because it is pm and the food is not quite as fresh i will give it a second chance and be sure to be here much earlier in the day so far seems pretty overrated,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,croissant is nice and chewy and flaky on the outside delicious add some strawberry jam and a latte and it is a great way to start the day the apple crumble has got to be one of the best things here heat that bad boy up and it tastes just like mom is apple pie love it big enough to share huge portion tried the tuna bread as well sadly it was disappointing and difficult to eat cut not the most dainty if you ask me plus you get kickin breath after so do not order this if you are on a date,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,best bakery in singapore croissants bread sandwiches pastries and drinks real quality plus i enjoy the local scene in tiong bahru to return many times,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,three visits over three days probably wont be a th if there are more than   tables in use the service dropped drastically in proportion to the number of people they had to serve asked for sandwich ro be toasred heated came out just warm  coffees ordered at same time but each came separately   minutes apart no warning no explanation not good enough,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,had the squid ink buns stuffed w ham cheese and croissants plain almond paste and everything tasted good although pricey extra star was for the fact that we could walk there from our apt,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,the crowds here are insane despite heading over post lunch hour we were still met with queues and what is up with the separate lines for orders and drinks anyway the order queue is so long it will definitely intersect with the drinks queue at some point creating a confusing mess found it very frustrating and decided to do a takeaway of lemon zest tart and berry crumble both items were at  each which was a little eh as the tart is smaller than one is palm and the crumble was easily twice the size of the tart tart was well not tart which left me a little disappointed it was actually rather sweet given the candied lemon zest tart shell was firm to the bite and made a mess when it shattered all over my desk i quite liked the berry crumble now that was tart and sweet all at once the base was buttery the crumbled top crunchy and the whole item summery and yummy,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,there is alot of hype surrounding tiong bahru bakery it is gotten alot of press ever since it opened so i wanted to see if it lived up to all the glowing reviews quite easy to miss if you walk a little too fast along eng hoon st the bakery is got quite a welcoming interior as a long row of pastries greet you as you enter i tried the supposedly best croissant in singapore with a cup of flat white there is free flow of butter and jam and water on a separate counter which i loved the croissant was still delicately crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside it was good yes but then how much better can the plain dough of croissant get not to dismiss the skill behind baking a really quality croissant but surely there is more to this bakery than the croissants so i had the salmon sandwich which came with a cardamom bread all the sandwiches have been pre made so you cannot really choose whether you want salmon with the squid ink bread or chicken with the cardamom bread which is quite a bummer because i wanted to try the squid ink bread with the salmon i did not really enjoy the cardamom bread because the cardamom seeds kept getting stuck in my teeth it was very crowded for a weekday and the queue was busy throughout final verdict i dough not know if it will continue to reinvent itself or get too complacent with its current success but for now i will just come for takeaways because it gets way too crowded,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,their baguette is the best i have had so far in singapore easily a five star rating but what brought it down is the below average crowd control which can easily be explained by the craze caused by word of mouth and being in the straits times taste wise the baguette is near perfect down to the hard flaky brown skin and the moist chewy flesh that has the texture and bite comparable to the boulangerie in rue caulaincourt in paris loved it price wise at  cm the benchmark the one in singapore comes up to s   while a parisian counterpart would be   about s   a little too overpriced especially the croissants but lending the gontran cherrier baking touch comes with a price i guess will definitely be back for the basic breads but will give the sandwiches savoury items and coffee a miss as there is no way i am paying s   for a sandwich the size of my palm,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,i must say that tiong bahru bakery is quite a cheeky cafe this from the outside you may easily walk past disregarding it as one of them shophouses especially with the chinese teal stamp on the wall outside yet on the inside it was as though past met present its choice of furniture created a feel of a s bakery yet it also had all the luxuries of a present day air conditioned cafe if anything it can get pretty congested when fully seated and so rather noisy but i guess that just adds to the buzz and bustle of it all i asked the lady at the counter as i always do for their recommendation and was a little surprised when she pointed me to their simplest of plain croissants it did seem quite pricey   but i thought that if she would dare to point me to something as plain as that there must be something to it so on i went to get that and just that it was such a treat you could help yourself to as much butter and jam as you wanted from the side and trust me you will want more than one little dish of it the prune plum jam was such a good balance of sweet and a little sour and a tinge of bitter which made my croissant taste like a good after meal sweetener then if you would add the butter you feel like it could well be a pre meal bite such versatile tastes based on the freshest crisp and perfectly baked croissants you will find in this country i found it to be   well spent,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,i absolutely love the vibe of this cafe because i have celiac disease and cannot eat gluten i cannot speak to their food items beautiful looking muffins pies tarts etc but the coffee is fabulous they always have a line and the buzz of energy makes for a very pleasant environment we always look forward to a stop here while we are doing our marketing,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,best bakery in singapore having recently moved here from san francisco i have been trying to find a good bakery with good coffee and both savory and sweet options tiong bahru bakery is it everything i have tried there has not disappointed traditional baguette is amazing chocolate almond croissant is good and the specialty bun with ham sandwich is excellent,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,the coffee is good but not fantastic either pretty standard but over priced pastry is nice yet not cheap as well more for ambient if go there again,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,definitely one of the best croissants that i have eaten although the place was small and crowded the servers were friendly and efficient we waited less than  minutes to get a table for four the latte was rich and flavorful the brownie is good and so were the almond croissant and brioche took away a squid ink bread with salmon and ham but my sister said it was on the salty side the cafe music is rather loud and i do recommend going to raffles city outlet for a more luxurious and lazy way to spend a sunday morning,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,come for the kouign amann and buzzy atmosphere spotted before zoe taythe weekend that tiong bahru bakery first opened traffic snarled to a stop on eng hoon street despite new outdoor seating the best place to sit is indoors close by the long display of breads and pastries sandwiches and baked desserts in that order if you are just ordering the fabulous  hands coffee skip the usually long queue and go straight to the counter one for cash payments and the other for credit cards tiong bahru neighbours swear by the kouign amann   a salted caramel spiral shaped croissant which offers crisp layers and layers of buttery sticky delight there is no fruit filling if you like those pullman bakery does a decent version there are three croissants plain   almond and chocolate the texture of the plain croissant is not the classic flaky sort here it has many distinct layers not a unanimous favourite the almond paste version is much too sweet for me while the chocolate has a really good quality to it baked desserts are rather pricey for the size but seem to be popular try the palm sized lemon tart  which is sweet and zingy with a lovely short crust sandwiches are a good deal with various ingredients such as bacon avocado and tuna each matched to a specific bread such as squid ink or sunflower seeds and makes for a cheaper lunch than at sister establishment  hands on the other side of tiong bahru from the recreated old skool look to the freshly baked and high quality goods this place deserves all its kudos but the slightly high price point keeps it from becoming a true daily hangout,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,the baguette is way too tough i prefer maison kayser is baguette the plain croissant was crispy on the outside but a bit too doughy in the inside at least for my taste they are closed on tuesdays by the way,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,good coffee and amazing croissants i have also had their lemon tarts and it was definitely tart enough i would totally go back for more of those mouth watering croissants really cute place great to chill and snack they also have the coolest door ever,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,coffee is excellent and the pastry is divine a little on the pricey side but very cool and hip a must try if you are in the tiong bahru area,Positive
tiong-bahru-bakery,this place is way too hyped for what it is the food is not bad but it is nothing special and not really worth the price their pastries kougin amann i am talking to you are loaded with butter and sugar and the bread is not anything memorable for a bakery that charges so much pastries are usually   sandwiches   it is a pretty big disappointment,Negative
tiong-bahru-bakery,the best for croissant it is real remind me home and italian bakery i know the place is french but the location and the aroma seems to be back when was child going to my bakery on my street,Positive
national-museum-of,well organized overview of the history of singapore nice use of senses in this museum ticket purchase online or in person educational for kids and adults rated g pg version of the war non residents visitors  admission steep discount for singaporeans,Positive
national-museum-of,any nations you go for the first time it is respectful to learn about their history and culture a museum like the national museum of singapore would be the best example underneath the glitzy hotels and swanky retails lies a more profound singapore a history that started with the entire nation being tropical agrarian land before the arrival of the westerners it was more man vs wild than crazy rich asians it starts off with the indigenous people aka the malays and their methods of cultivating land then the arrival of chinese mainly from provinces of hainan and other parts of south china who arrived as early as the th century both groups worked along side each other in the jungles later traders from india mostly from tamil arrived museum murals depicted how each of the groups worked side by side later segments in museums depicts the arrival of europeans and especially stamford raffle the founder of modern singapore it focus the control of singapore under the british east india company it was still a colony with current day malaysia known as british malaya until  when it joined malaysia as a soverign nation rest of the museum focused on its succession from malaysia in  and the formation of todays singapore which is the modern metropolis of success,Negative
national-museum-of,i am a sucker for museums especially national museums representing a country the nms is located in a prestigious english parliamentary type building with large columns sweeping staircases wide corridors and numerous wings bottom floor entry has a singapore history exhibit which talks of the native people early chinese indian malay traders dutch and british colonizers japanese imperialists and eventual separation from malaysia the latter with film clips discussing the hard decision on the separation from malaysia quite poignant artifacts throughout the exhibit including a japanese wwii replica tank second floor has an animation exhibition in the round and also streaming along a winding corridor depicting animals trees flowers etc impressive to kids and adults other exhibits on fashion women is changing roles in singaporean society the benefits of government housing changes between s and s singapore you can easily spend  hours here cost is  singapore dollars per adult,Positive
national-museum-of,a great place to learn about the history of singapore highly recommend taking the guided tour at  am tixs are  per person sd our docent was a retired pilot who spent  hr  mins taking the group thru the gallery he was excellent and knew his history well and passionate about sharing his knowledge the museum is very modern and pretty several things to see besides singapore is past history also modern growth since the s onward in the upstairs area and an animated d area with a sky fall of flowers and a forest of local animals habitat and flowers i found it to be dark for the animated portion but it was very pretty there is a section which talks about all the colonial occupation of singapore including the japanese occupation during ww and the suffering endured by the singaporeans when we were in japan  yrs ago the museum in japan made their war invasion sound like a patriotic thing and how their citizens suffered and the recovery efforts after they surrendered no mention of their atrocities to the countries they invaded nor regrets or public apologies there is a tiny cafe on the bottom floor if you are in need of rest or nourishment,Positive
national-museum-of,i believe the national museum of singapore should be the first thing everyone visits during their travels to this beautiful country this museums shows you the history behind this amazing metropolis and all the hardships they have been going through before and after their independence in  this museum will definitely give you a greater understanding and appreciation of how this country works and how they have been so successful during my visit i got to enjoy a special exhibit in world war ii which was very eye opening growing up in mexico and then moving to the united states i only learned what happened in europe and north america during wwii and it was somewhat scary to learned everything the japanese empire did in this side of the world during the same time period i could not believe we were never taught any of this at school thank you national museum of singapore for teaching me something new and opening my eyes to new possibilities and world views,Positive
national-museum-of,as far as national museums go this appears to need a major overhaul completely skipping the dutch influence on singapore is history is a major faux pas especially considering how singapore wants to be seen as inclusive they apparently had no problem setting up a comprehensive display on the brutal japanese occupation and that was only three years for the admission price the facility leaves a lot to be desired though the effort made is certainly commendable,Negative
national-museum-of,great museum especially if you want to take advantage of their air conditioning lot is of history and you get to finally learn all the western influences had on singapore and there are exhibits that talks about singapore during world war  and their independence several years later,Positive
national-museum-of,great place to learn about singapore is history especially the guided tour by a passionate volunteer guide a lot of coverage on life during and post ww lunch options are rather limited and overpriced though,Positive
national-museum-of,entrance is  for regular adult and  for senior citizens however it is free for all local residents nice way to soak into the history and culture of singapore place is huge and immaculate wanted to see the janice wong exhibit however it was closed for a private function,Positive
national-museum-of,i was visiting singapore for a few days and as someone who is used to dry heat the singapore humidity is a lot to handle especially midday as such it was important to us to find things to do that would be both interesting and allow us to escape the heat one of the things we did was to check out the national museum as the name suggests this is a museum dedicated to all things singaporean the exhibits detail singapore is history throughout the years and smaller exhibits will go into more detail of certain eras or certain facets throughout the ages e g pop culture fashion plants even if you are not a huge history buff i think that you can definitely find something interesting one of my favorite exhibits was the special story of the forest exhibit created by teamlab it has digital images projected onto the walls maybe not everyone would find it interesting but i happen to be a fan of teamlab is work although all the descriptions are provided in english they did have handouts in  other languages for non english speakers this was useful for my mom as she reads and understands chinese a lot more easily than english overall this is not a bad way to escape the heat for a few hours you will be able to see some interesting things while learning more about the development of singapore as a country,Positive
national-museum-of,the building is flashy and the interior itself is worth seeing if you are a singaporean pr you can get in for free otherwise it is not too much to pay either i give this place three stars because most of the exhibitions here are from other countries yes granted that people of singapore did come from many other places and they are all immigrants so to speak but there are not many interesting contents in the museum apart from the time when they were colonised by the great britain museum wise it is ok bordering on the must see because what else do you do in singapore after eating laksa and chilli crab right kidding but chinese heritage museum gives you so much more story than this place,Negative
national-museum-of,the previous time i was in singapore i gave this place a miss namely because i thought that it was basically a natural history museum however as it turned out it had nothing to do with natural history and eveything to do with the city of singapore basically the museum looks at the whole period of the city from the prehistoric eras through colonialism world war ii and the birth of the island republic and the problems that arose therein it is interesting but really only if you are hugely keen on knowing more about the city itself or are bored and looking for something to do as for me i found it interesting but not hugely fantastic,Negative
national-museum-of,it is always a good thing to learn a thing or two about a new place when traveling we visited the museum to learn more about singapore is past present and future i loved the exhibits and the artistry the museum offers great for the whole family did i mention that there is ac and escalators,Positive
national-museum-of,a good museum for singapore is history but i went here after going to the asian civilisations museum so it seemed a bit repetitive although cheaper the second floor of the museum is singapore through the decades that portion was a bit fun especially the  s room lots of reminiscing for my mom i guess the culture over in hong kong was not too different during that decade,Positive
national-museum-of,if you are rich dine at flutes restaurant in the museum if you are middle class eat at food for thought in the museum if you are on a budget makan at food republic across the street if you are poor chow down at koufu food court in the basement of smu cross the street and take an escalator down museums make visitors hungry,Positive
national-museum-of,absolutely phenomenal the nms is one of the best museums i have every visited beautiful building with terrific architecture both inside and out for the main admission fee of  sgd you get access to several art galleries and two exhibits on singapore history there is also one special exhibit that you need to pay extra for which i opted not to pay extra for the art exhibits are okay full disclosure i only had time to check out two but in my opinion the stars of the show are the history exhibits there is one of the first floor that offers a fairly comprehensive overview of singapore is history starting from pre european contact through the present i felt like i really learned a lot about the different eras in singapore is history and there were plenty of cool artifacts along with mny different oral histories that you could listen to by picking up the receivers places along the walls the past  years of singapore was a smaller exhibit upstairs in a beautiful wing of the building this was split into four parts each in a different room pre war colonial era through s japanese occupation s post war independence s and s and the beginning of the modern era s and s each room gave an interesting snapshot of the era depicted my favorite was the last one covering through the s it was quite elaborate with a giant mosaic screen in the far wall facing two rows of stadium seats that were taken from the original singapore stadium the screen changed every  seconds or so to show a new scene there was also a second smaller room behind the giant screen that was set up like a drive in theatre complete with mock up cars that you could sit in to watch the short film that was playing on repeat brilliant visit this museum if you do not you are really missing out,Negative
national-museum-of,i think this is a good way to get a little picture of how singapore has evolved over the years there are several galleries that cover sort of one or two decade stretches of time and those are really interesting and presented in very engaging and creative ways the main singapore history gallery has information dating back to about ad and forward to the economic powerhouse that it is become careful to point out that singapore existed before raffles landed and started it plus for the wwii buff in me the downstairs traveling exhibit covers the experience under japanese occupation i wish some of the exhibits had gone in to a bit more detail i am the guy who loves the most minute details about some of this stuff but all in all worth visiting more expensive than the nearby asian civilizations museum but definitely covering very different content,Positive
national-museum-of,a born and raised singaporean my first trip here was long overdue this is a world class museum of the history of singapore with plenty of interactive audio and video exhibits to tell singapore is story from its roots as a sleepy fishing village to bustling global city state i thoroughly enjoyed my visit and spent   hours here by myself i explored every nook and cranny and there was always something exciting to see one of the highlights of my trip were the glass rotunda which houses teamlab is magic forest interactive exhibit if you are familiar with teamlab you will know they make the most entrancing magical interactive exhibits when you first enter you will be captivated by a large room with magical plants projected on the walls swirling around as ambient background music enveloping you amazing there is also a larger room like that with comfy bean bags that you can lounge in and just soak in the atmosphere i loved it so much i visited twice another highlight was the exhibit life in singapore surviving syonan it documents life under the japanese occupation and was completely fascinating i have heard stories of the occupation but never visited an exhibit showcasing the documents and personal accounts beforehand there is also a cute room with a heartwarming story of how a couple fell in love during those harsh times this exhibit gave me great insight into the japanese occupation and i loved every moment the main exhibit history of singapore is large comprehensive and beautiful it covers singapore is entire history and i believe singaporeans and tourists alike should visit admission for singaporeans and permanent residents is free just flash your ic and it is only   for non residents if you are on a budget skip the special exhibit that is going on right now what is not visible is not invisible because it is not really worth  its the kind of art that is only art because of what the artist writes about it there are two cafes and a restaurant to choose from when you get hungry clean and beautiful bathrooms are everywhere the architecture of the museum is both traditional and modern and will take your breath away overall an amazing museum it makes me proud of my homeland and to be singaporean,Positive
national-museum-of,good place for a quick rundown on singapore is history ground floor is currently about the late prime minister lee kuan yew who was instrumental in making singapore what it is today the lower floors are about singapore is history how the major ethnic groups chinese malays indians came here and what they did also some colonial history and about the japanese occupation of singapore during the nd world war i found the revere bell see pic interesting i bet most americans do not know that american patriot paul revere is daughter gave this bell made in boston to a church in singapore in,Positive
national-museum-of,really nice building where we spent some time waiting for our battle box tour learned about the history of singapore which i did not know much about really liked the sculpture or is it a display of all the pots and pans making a huge sphere in the entrance i did not have time to see the rest of the museum but apparently goes into detail for specific eras in history i enjoy historical museums a lot more than art museums so this was good i think entrance was about   but worth it to get outta the rain,Positive
national-museum-of,i had fun here as a tourist from usa loved the exhibits and the price is just about average great accommodations for kids as far as i can tell with areas designed just for kids and whatnot we easily spent  hours here reading about the history of singapore,Positive
national-museum-of,fantastic place to learn about singapore is history i spent about   hours here but could easily have seen more there is a cafe in there but bring snacks if you plan to stay long they have great bathrooms water fountains wi fi and of course air conditioning there is so much to see closest mrt station is bras basah but dhoby ghaut is walkable too,Positive
national-museum-of,the nsm is permanent exhibition was being revamped for the nation is th anniversary when i visited but i cannot imagine i would have enjoyed it more than the singapura  years which very thoughtfully presents singapore is lengthy history of human habitation i am guessing here that it was way more rewarding for this visitor than any bus tour around the city could have been we also got complimentary chinese new year photographs and enjoyed a comfortable if unmemorable lunch in the restaurant,Positive
national-museum-of,great museum that focuses on the history of singapore lots of rotating exhibits through a well directed variety of galleries easily  hours spend inside with cheap admission and air conditioning it seemed like a no brainer to stop in to kill some time in the afternoon immaculately maintained and clearly updated regularly,Positive
national-museum-of,museum is free admission to all singaporean and pr now during school holiday it is sn other holiday place for your family with kids to go and enjoy food for thought definitely positioned themselves with an excellent location that people would in any case to love and enjoy with the venue and the selections in the manu,Positive
national-museum-of,so this review is solely for my visit during the singapore night festival  the national museum is very much a centerpiece of the night festival and they open it up with a bunch of cool exhibits for free as a tourist it was really exciting to be able to check out the museum when i went they had a really neat exhibit for young photographers and a pretty interesting in depth history exhibit on singapore is past very informative it is also a huge museum there are three floors i believe the top floor is a play area for younger children all in all great experience and i was glad to be able to stop by while during the festival,Positive
national-museum-of,i was visiting singapore for a work vacation and had the opportunity to check out the national museum the museum provides a great overview on the history of singapore from pre historic times and early civilizations to the period of european colonization to early modern history to japanese controlled singapore during world war ii finally to modern day society great museum,Positive
national-museum-of,best place for history ever i love it so much it makes me feel proud to be from singapore the building is so nice and the layout is fantastic admission is always free which is so much fun however my tour guide was very silly last time but whatever,Positive
national-museum-of,the rather iconic colonial white structure and dome really stands out in this part of town and it is quite a lot bigger than one might think the gift shop at the front entrance has an interesting collection of singapore designer souvenirs which make for great gifts for tourists to pick up i enjoy visiting the various exhibitions from time to time the last one i saw was the wedding dress one and i am also a fan of the swinging lamp installation on the second level parking here can be expensive you might be better off parking at smu instead and taking a quick walk over,Positive
national-museum-of,located next to the smu school of law accountancy this place is very good to chill at during a break between lessons there is a restaurant called novus as well as a museum cafe to cater to the crowd i love the architecture of the national museum and the interior too which is a nice simplistic white there is a swinging light installation on the second level by suzann victor titled contours of a rich manouvere they have housed popular exhibitions such as the ruins of pompeii and more recently famous art works from europe and more admission is free for all tertiary students,Positive
national-museum-of,as the name suggests the national museum of singapore is one of the biggest museum in singapore with frequent installations and rotating exhibitions there is always something new to expect from national museum there are many different types of exhibition there from artefacts to film photos from the past and even interactive exhibitions it holds a lot of history and cultural facts about singapore a good place to learn and appreciate the place we call home at the gift and souvenir shop it holds a lot of creative and unique stuffs about singapore from badges to t shirts cups and mugs i even bought myself a choy charm which was simple adorable really cute items sold there most stuff are suitable for gifts too,Positive
national-museum-of,been here a few times for night festivals but today i caught the last day of the princely treasures of lichtenstein went to the   guided tour and it was informative and fun saw baroque flemish and other lovely paintings i also liked the decorative works like pottery drinking vessels and pietra dura chests,Positive
national-museum-of,i traveled to singapore by myself in the summer of  and had a fantastic time here i am not an expert on museums but i have visited several in europe and asia this is by far my favorite museum in asia prior to my trip i took a quick glance of the country is background so i was happy to see the collections of trinkets i felt the museum did an awesome job at presenting the history in a way that was entertaining and informative the bright green audio guide is probably the best device i have ever used at any museum in the world,Positive
national-museum-of,i went to singapore for a few days and made my way to the national museum of singapore to learn more about the country since i pretty much had no knowledge of its history i have to say the building is absolutely beautiful though its mostly empty because the main galleries are underground i kind of walked around the empty spaces wondering where the museum part was until i found the main entrance but once i was inside i found the nms the most well curated museum i have ever been to you enter the main exhibit and galleries via a cylindrical building and go through a movie which was the most unnecessary part of this whole experience since it was just a gathering point they give you for free an audio guide connected to an ipad like mobile device that has every artifact with a there was so much information it was kind of overwhelming every different room was a new group of info everything had audio and then the artifacts in that room are listed at the bottom of the touchscreen if you want to find out more info about anything all the time periods of singapore are covered and there is a lot of primary sources and pictures tracing the history one thing this museum did very well was understand that not everyone likes history and maybe some people are dragged here by someone else in his or her party i say that because throughout the museum there are two different tracks you can take events and personal stories some people love history and some people do not care for it and would rather hear about personal stories and have history interpreted that way instead of just by dates and battles and conquests etc that was this attempts to mollify i followed the events track so i actually did not see the other part of the museum based on the personal stories i checked out one room just out of curiosity and it seemed like a completely different museum the one room i checked out talked about women is rights in singapore yet i did not see that topic discussed at length in the events track so it made me wonder what was not covered in the other track and vice versa i see in other reviews here that the audio guide is slow and there is actually nothing to read on the walls since everything is in the audioguide to that i say that singapore is a multi cultural place with four predominant languages english malaysia chinese and tamil what exactly do people want extended explanations in four languages under every single artifact and picture and portrait that is untenable which is why the handheld device is so invaluable and makes the experience much better imagine the crazy clutter everywhere if everything in the mobile device had to be printed and put on display and the audioguide is great for visitors because i saw one guide in japanese and that would not have been a language on any of the walls but now those visitors can understand what the museum is showing them yes there is a lot of information and the guide is slow but pretty much everyone around me rushed through the museum because they did not want to go through the trouble of typing in the number  on a touchscreen seriously i compare this to other major museums that i have been to like the louvre or the uffizi and i am struck by how much better this museum was than those that is not to say the actual information or art is better here than at the louvre of course not but moreso i mean how the experience here is so much more user friendly and there are not surly museum workers standing around in a perpetual state of being pissed off with having to deal with tourists the price of entry is sgd  and i got in free with a student id and the audioguide is free for everyone and that stands in contrast to price gouging at poorly kept european museums where entry and audioguide are easily euros and there is not nearly as much information and ease of use as here overall i would definitely recommend a visit to the national museum of singapore there is enough information to spend all day but after about   hours it gets a bit daunting to learn so much there is a cafe restaurant at the museum but raffles city is close as is the colonial quarter so there is plenty of places to eat around,Negative
national-museum-of,if you want to kills sometime you an walk around the museum for hours i went in for a exhibit and it was only s  very educational and well maintained the building is pristine and i see people taking wedding photos there the area is nice as well there not a bad walk on a sunday morning,Positive
national-museum-of,this is possibly the museum that i have been to the most it is located just a little distance away from dhoby ghaut mrt station and the building is easily recognizable apart from the special exhibitions there are several permanent exhibitions at the national museum that tells retells the history of singapore it includes the singapore living galleries namely on food fashion photography fashion and film wayang and the singapore history gallery for the living galleries i would say i enjoyed the section on food the most it is really telling of our country is culture colorful and vibrant there are even videos on the process of preparing the local dish which keeps people interested and easy for tourists to understand our culture as well i like the singapore history gallery as well firstly it takes on a story telling approach which makes it more engaging it covers the major national events in the development of singapore as well as personal stories of people from the past it comes with an easy to operate multimedia handheld device called the companion which facilitates the audio visual tour the device is available in four languages namely english mandarin malay and japanese definitely a place to visit once in a while and to introduce to your overseas friends when they come by singapore for a visit,Positive
national-museum-of,i highly recommend a visit if only to escape the scorching heat humidity of midday s pore the history section on singapore is amazing i learnt so much about my own country even though i grew up and lived there for almost  years worth every penny,Positive
national-museum-of,the national museum is one of the more popular local museums there are always interesting international exhibitions going on with a small section bringing the traveling exhibition to a local context for example in the recent wedding dress exhibition from the victoria albert museum in london there was a small section on local traditional wedding outfits and symbolisms such as the cheongsam in the exhibition on treasures from ukraine there is a bit at the end describing the importance of gold in asian cultures as well the permanent exhibitions are also quite worth exploring to find out about singapore and our history the singapore history gallery in particular offers a very personal interactive experience with your own audio companion and different paths that you can take throughout the exhibit my only complaint is that there is insufficient time to cover all the exhibitions in the building in one day which is a pity as there is so much to see,Positive
national-museum-of,this is the only museum i know that has galleries devoted to food other than the special exhibitions there are a few permanent exhibitions at the national museum on the history of singapore such as the singapore living galleries namely on food fashion fashion and film wayang and the singapore history gallery i don tfind the permanent exhibits tthat exciting however the historical building is a great place for taking photos a friend of mine posed for dance pictures here she was featured recently in the chinese newspapers and must say they turned out beauttifully,Positive
national-museum-of,lovely colonial building on the oldest part of singapore the building is lovely but the museum is so well worth a visit there is a long of history without it being overwhelming the displays are lively and i so loved that some rooms were re enacted at they were i would certainly advise anyone to take a few hour to visit,Positive
national-museum-of,nice museum depicting the history of singapore air conditioned museum,Positive
native,if you are going to spend over  sgd on a cocktail do it here the mixologists at native take their job seriously and have a passion for making the most creative cocktails i was very impressed with their style devotion to representing local flavours and above all the taste their menu is eclectic and fun you will find amazing mixtures like soy sauce and coffee oysters and kaya toast a handful of selected drinks sure to please the adventurous palate after a tipple take a walk upstairs to learn about how the magic happens it is the fun day in science class that i missed a well earned evening,Positive
native,native boasts cocktails off the beaten track procured with native produce i enjoyed an oyster cocktail seriously locally sourced oysters from the nearby isle of ubin infused with miso cured egg pepper and coriander shoots i was either going to love or hate my cocktail selection loved it the sparkling saki is a must try too sweet and easy to drink friendly knowledgeable staff make for a great social eve out,Positive
native,i came here while visiting singapore with a friend the ambiance is very cool and trendy the bartenders and staff were excellent so friendly and welcoming they spent time explaining all of the drinks to us and even showing us where they make concoctions and try different things for the menu they may have also snuck us a few different drinks to try sparkling saki is my new favorite all the drinks were tried were excellent delicious and unique i would definitely recommend coming here if you are in singapore,Positive
native,can i give this place  stars native is not just my favorite bar in singapore it is a strong contender for my favorite bar on the planet there are many reasons to love native and i will list most of them below if you want the quick rundown native serves super high quality expertly made delicious cocktails many containing very rare spirits with amazing customer service and all in a cozy and inviting setting here is some more detail the drinks native is drinks are a combination of superior quality and exquisite taste i have been looking all over the planet for sri lankan arrack a slightly sweet liquor that reminds me of a combination of bourbon and rum and not to be confused with arak which is completely different since i visited the island nation last year and not only does native have it but they make one of the best cocktails i have ever had with it the pineapple arrack this drink showcased the near perfection by which native crafts every cocktail i could not get enough of it not to be outdone my wife is cocktail was also amazingly tasty while the prices are a bit above average you wo not feel like you are overpaying by the time you leave and you might feel like you did not pay enough the extras we were not expecting anything more than the drinks that we ordered but the bar included complementary welcome and parting drinks these two drinks showed off their in house distillery and turned the slightly higher than normal drink prices into a great value the service not only were the bartenders personable and knowledgeable but they were obviously very passionate about working at native in addition the owner came out and talked to us for a long time which we really enjoyed at the end of our stay they even took us upstairs and gave us a tour of their distillery all in all this was an experience not just a visit to a bar the location easy to get to very comfortable and inviting and with clean bathrooms if you are in singapore and like cocktails you owe it to yourself to experience native,Positive
native,at first i was turned off as i wanted one of the bartenders to explain the difference between two drinks i was deciding between another staff member explained the difference between the two cocktails to me not a good look as all the staff should be able to discern each drink on the menu what i really liked about this place was that the cocktails were very different craftily concocted organic and represented different parts of the world even the playlist is carefully constructed for this place my intrigue and respect came back for native i enjoyed both of my drinks at this place,Negative
native,second stop on my night of nicer cocktail bar hopping native welcoming and homey with drinks inspired by the bartenders travels yes they go on little trips together and come back with jars of local ingredients to infuse into their cocktails cool right it reminded me a little of the whole nordic farm to table philosophy that i am such a fan of and what do you know some of their bartenders are currently in copenhagen collecting ingredients and learning from the noma chefs amazing fun fact my drink came in a frozen napkin and i thought it would be wasteful to keep a freezer full of frozen napkins but my friend kindly reminded me that liquid nitrogen is a thing oops anyway along with our drinks shown above we were given some sparkling sake much better than hot or cold sake potentially because the flavor is lighter and some gin infused pomegranate stuff and a tour of the cocktail lab where they distill and extract concentrated flavors of the various ingredients that they collect straight up fancy versions of the distillation apparatuses that i have used in organic chemistry lab wild they do not use lemons and limes typically staples of any bar due to waste instead relying on the acidic profiles of other ingredients to give their drinks that same flavor very unique concept and i am a huge fan of their narrative definitely give this place a try tourist or local,Positive
native,tldr this place exceeded all my expectations which was a lot considering its one of the worlds top bars highly recommend due to amazing hospitality i came to check out the place near opening because i was worried it would be busy but luckily i was immediately seated at the bar the place is tiny but not in a bad way maybe it is because i did not have to wait long so it did not bother me it had an intimate setting once seated they hand you a menu and a glass of sparkling sake the sake was refreshing and slightly sweet maybe to cleanse the palate it was great considering how hot and humid it was outside i ordered the strawberry kimchi had a nice kick and they used strawberry granita to keep the drink cool the drink was just okay in my opinion it is kind of pricey but that seems to be the norm in singapore i would have tried more drinks but there were other bars i wanted to stop by as well what really gave this establishment  stars was the customer service maybe because i was by myself but the bartender and host were friendly and easy to talk to i ended up leaving with recommendations for bars in taipei and tokyo too,Negative
native,this place is amazing we walked in late for our reservation and the staff could not be nicer or more welcoming we interacted with all of the staff while we were there and all the drinks were explained in detail we were offered a tour of where they make many of the ingredients for the drinks but we were already late for our next destination i got the sarapan and jovanie got the pinapple arrack both were good though i liked jovanie is better i was even going to order it but thought to try at least two drinks while we were there if you are looking for a beautiful bar with a great staff and delicious drinks that you have never tasted before go here,Positive
native,i really enjoyed myself at native not only were the drinks pleasent the customer service was excellent native brings to the bar scene local and regional influences sourcing and just an all round good vibe their spirits are mostly derived from small regional distilleries mostly in south east asia the seating begun with a free shot of sparkling sake and proceeded to our orders and finally a free whiskey citrus combination to end the night very enjoyable our host spared no details as he shared the philosophy behind native most of what they have are created in house from kombucha to different pastes and other fermentation not to mention they only played local music i had the grasshopper which is a classic twist on the usual grasshopper with a dash of actual fermented grasshopper my friends had the peranakan which came with a kueh and had strong essence of gula melaka and we also tried the oolong highball and pineapple drink overall i really enjoyed the experience i believe the drinks could use a little more strength but i believe the experience at native itself is worth the visit,Positive
native,what a cool bar experience the drinks are so unique because they really pride themselves on sourcing local ingredients and traditional flavor pairings and the bartenders are all incredibly knowledgeable of their liquors where they are from history etc came here with a rather large party while visiting singapore with a family friend who always takes guests here and i can see why we sat at the booth and as members of our party started coming in they provided us with a free starter drink a delicious sparkling sake which was very much appreciated some of the drinks had really interesting profiles like strawberry and kimchi and a grasshopper that used crushed up dried grasshoppers when they served the drinks the bartender would go through each drink to explain the background behind it and the recommended way of enjoying it a few minutes later he would come back with some of the key ingredients and liquors in them and go further into the history and importance of those ingredients it was really cool to experience and provided some key insights into singaporean history overall native has a really cool atmosphere and is unlike any other bar i have visited before you can tell that they really pride themselves on their quality sourcing and sustainability as an establishment the painting along the stairs as you walk up was made using the scraps from the bar the interior is not very large but is very intimate and homey yes the drinks are expensive but it is comparable to other cocktail bars in singapore you get a really authentic experience and delicious drinks when you visit native,Positive
native,what an incredible bar in singapore the drinks are extraordinary very special and the taste is unbelievable there are only a few so innovative bars in the world so if you go to native slow down enjoy the explanation of the team of each drink and maybe you have luck and you will be invited into the lab,Positive
native,very creative and innovative cocktails lots of restaurants and bars are fond of saying we are telling a story this is actually happening at native you can get a nice education of local flavors through these drinks stayed way longer than anticipated deserving of all the accolades,Positive
native,this place is great the vibe the atmosphere workers and most importantly the drinks my only qualm about this bar is the teeny tiny baby portions you would need  drinks to get a buzz huge ice cube and the drink barely has any liquid drinks are around  sgd so be prepared to spend if want to get drunk,Positive
native,amazing upscale cocktail bar with an amazing theme they focus on regional spirits and even go so far as to have all their drink ware hand made and hand painted every drink i tried was unique a pure delight to the senses the drinks are a little on the pricey side but then again what is not in singapore it is worth the price for such a special experience,Positive
native,best bar in singapore one of the best in asia and one of the more unique in the world of their bottle collection they had only about two kinds that were widely distributed really excellent cocktails knowledgeable and fun staff relaxed atmosphere very cool distillery on the third floor if you visit one bar in singapore it should be this one,Positive
native,great ambiance super informed friendly staff that is all before one gets to the drinks wow pictures do not do it justice and they even have a mixing lab upstairs to try out new variations highly recommended,Positive
native,some of most creative thoughtful well executed and downright delicious cocktails i have ever had this place is different very different it is not just another cocktail bar with the usual drinks you will not even find spirits you recognize here the spirits used ingredients and ideas are as original as i have ever seen they have spirits i have never heard of and note i collect and am a spirits enthusiast and the recipes are epic they do not have rail spirits ambiance is nice but the place is new and more folks need to discover it and once this happens trust me it will be as packed as anywhere else bartenders are awesome and super friendly and clearly really skilled go here of you wish to have happiness,Positive
native,absolutely unique bar with completely handcrafted local cocktails you simply will not find anywhere else in the world,Positive
native,this place is groundbreaking and inspiring got to try some really amazing spirits from thailand i cannot wait to go back,Positive
native,while visiting another bar nearby i was recommended to visit this bar and i am happy for this tip while most bars that i visited in singapur are focused on western spirits this one is clearly focused on what they call regional products of course regional in this case means from india up to japan with these products they need to invent their own drinks and that is what i really like here you do not get the same drinks as everywhere else they are also trying to reduce waste and so you wo not get lime or lemon juice too small amount of juice for the big fruits they use different products even ants yes ants are part of recipies to get acid into the cocktail crunchy very nice personnel who even showed me the whole third floor with their own gin production,Negative
native,pretty new cocktail bar specialising in regionally sourced spirits they also infuse their own gin on the third floor space good service with friendly bartenders i am not so sure about the specialty cocktails and the acoustics are pretty weird as the music tends to drown it conversation ambience is a little off as i do not think many people know about this place yet so it can be pretty empty hope it picks up soon,Positive
mtr-1924,on the first morning during a business trip to singapore my boss gave me two options for breakfast continental breakfast at our hotel or some indian food was not much of a choice we walked for about  odd minutes from our hotel on orchard to little india soaking in the heat humidity and the greenery admiring the clean streets and the well mannered motorist silently pondering that this looks and feels like india except for much cleaner sigh we descended onto mtr courtesy yelp mtr is a small clean air conditioned restaurant trust me  mins of a morning walk in  humidity you respect air conditioning i ordered the pudi dosa neer dosa and the filter coffee i confess i would not have tried those except filter coffee if it were not for the nudge of my colleague i had never tried those two the pudi dosa came first with the chutney and the sambhar oh man those flavors and the texture it looked like an uttapam the savory pancake with ghee and a concoction of red spice on top not hot but spicy amazing flavors it had been a while that indian food has surprised my palate writing this review triggers the flavor and aroma memories such a delight then came the neer dosa neer means water in the local language as the name suggests its very light and subtle flavors quite the contrast from the previous dish this came paired with coconut sauteed gently with cardamon and sugar it was heavenly for me my colleague on the other hand was slightly less impressed he said he has had better neer dosa i believe him it was amazing for me two chutneys and the sambhar came with one of the dosas not sure what came with what what i can tell you with confidence it that my colleague and i agreed that the coconut chutney was as authentic as it gets and as flavorful as one expects we topped off the food with filter coffee that was probably the least favorite for me it tasted like instant coffee not a huge fan i went back another day for more pudi dosa my new favorite south indian restaurant only  hour flight away from palo alto and  hours from india ps i wish i had clicked pictures,Positive
mtr-1924,this was a delight to go to in little india very good service and authentic unique menu which is not so common in south indian restaurants i have been using mtr spices and have known this brand since childhood so going to the restaurant was exciting and special the manager graciously let us keep our stroller outside the door and mentioned not to worry about it the server was very helpful and told us to try few specials which we relished i definitely enjoyed their set dosa highly recommend this place if you are looking for south indian meal or just tidbits,Positive
mtr-1924,great food at good prices i ordered the mini meal pudi idli and buttermilk pudi idli  was my favoritebisibelabath raita rava kesari and avial in mini meal  were outstanding veg pulav was good and curd rice was decent but again i have never been a fan of curd rice so my opinion could be biased buttermilk  was very good too the portion size is generous one dish should suffice,Positive
mtr-1924,love that i stumbled across this gem on my first day in singapore delicious food kind service reasonable prices credit cards accepted i have been working my way through the menu and everything i have gotten so far has been fantastic always crowded it is that good,Positive
mtr-1924,firstly the place is clean and i mean clean even by singapore standards in keeping with the high standards set by the original location in bangalore try to go before  am for lunch especially on weekends and before pm in the evenings to order one must get in line at the cashier and pay up front then one gets a stand with the order number which is displayed on ones table menu highlights include the ragi finger millet dosa bisi bele bhaath rice cooked with lentils and veggies puliyogare tamarind rice maddur vada crispy fritters seasoned with onion curry leaves and spices set dosa like pancakes served with coconut veggie curry called avial drinks are decent the lassi is always good to try as is the badam almond milk this visit i had the akki roti roti made from rice flour and seasoned with onion and green chili and button idly soaked in thove kind of a thin daal without the typical spices of sambhar or rasam for dessert i highly recommend the badam halwa which is a deceptively small serving however since it consists of just ground almonds ghee and sugar it packs a massive punch do not underestimate its ability to fill you up only reason i give it  stars is that the spice level is often a tad too high for me else thumbs up including for the prompt and courteous service,Positive
mtr-1924,love the food not a veggie guy but this place has one of the best dosas in town enjoyed the unique experience,Positive
mtr-1924,overhyped indian snacks restaurant prata walau serves better dosai at better price too good for tourists though,Positive
mtr-1924,uddin vada similar to a donut very good fried crispy but inside was softpudi masala dosa has a spongy texture came with potatoes on topmini meal set tastings of five different rice stew sampler,Positive
mtr-1924,this place was up off the beaten path past little india and my husband and i went way out of our way to go here based on the reviews we ordered dosai dosa dishes and the sooji halwa for dessert the dosai were way too crispy missing the al dente chew you look for in a good dosa especially if you intend to roll it up it requires a flexibility to do so service was meh and the wait was long for a table lots of local indians so clearly they are doing something right though,Positive
mtr-1924,some amazing south indian food here its a very distinct style though something i have not tasted so far the dosa is thicker than usual but oh so crispy loved the vegetable special dosa unique texture and great taste the rice idli and coffee was amazing too will be back for sure,Positive
mtr-1924,not only is the indian food absolutely incredible but they were extremely considerate about my dairy allergy here the food came out quickly and the owner double checked to make sure it had no allergens great food great vegan dairy allergy options and nice service plus lots of free drinking water all around great experience,Positive
mtr-1924,love love love mtr in singapore do not miss the bisibele bath set dosa and filter coffee liked it so much that we had mtr catering and all our guests loved it fully vegetarian menu service is fast and restaurant is centrally located in little india,Positive
mtr-1924,i was not wanting for vegetarian but was very happy i sought out mtr is little india authentic curries and breads stuffed with all good things such as potato and onion popular with the locals too so you know you are into a good thing do try it if it is veggie curry in a hurry you are after you wo not be disappointed,Positive
mtr-1924,this was the most authentic indian food ive tasted in singapore the staff were extremely friendly and even seated me at  pm right as they were closing down for a switch to dinner i was really blessed by my experience highly recommended a must try in singapore many thanks pictured below is a famous single uddina vada doughnut accompanied with chutney,Positive
mtr-1924,poor quality oily food i guess this is the state of all indian restaurants in singapore,Negative
mtr-1924,the best south indian food in singapore for the price range that is saying a lot since there is a lot of completion for the same kind of food there used to go there often love the dosas button idlis vada filter coffee consistent good food used to eat there then pack food for home highly recommend it,Positive
mtr-1924,nothing more you can ask for a early morning dosa crispy and spiced just nice came here at exactly  am saturday and was the first customer no issue finding parking which is mostly a drag for eateries around here place is clean service is excellent before  it was packed back again july rd with the in laws and yep this as good and efficient as ever,Positive
mtr-1924,amazing restaurant very homely food for me as a south indian the food is well cooked and tastes very different and unique compared to other indian restaurants around little india try the pudi dosa a dosa with spicy chutney powder and ghee which is very special to this place service is fast and friendly i will come back again and again and again,Positive
mtr-1924,we went to mtr for breakfast two days in a row as we loved it food was freshly prepared and tasty the restaurant was very clean and well kept the staff was attentive it does get pretty crowded on weekends as soon as you enter the restaurant you need to place the order at the counter before being seated hence it is better to take a look at the menu which is placed outside the restaurant before entering so that you do not feel rushed i would highly recommend this place for good old indian breakfast,Positive
mtr-1924,deliciousness exemplified the taste of set dosa took me back to the days of delicious dosas at udupi upahar in kormangala south indian cuisine is hands down the best of all,Positive
mtr-1924,best vegetarian food and so clean masala dosa is my favorite also had the chai was there with a large group and we liked everything we ordered clean plates around highly recommended good service very fast and delicious,Positive
mtr-1924,recommended by a colleague they are a famous chain in india and have set up shop in singapore love this place the restaurant is a bit on the small side and they must be popular as there was a small queue when we arrived on an early saturday afternoon around pm they have a good system to minimize waiting by allowing you to place your order and pay while in the queue then being seated closer to when your food is ready as all orders take about  minutes my guess is b c everything is made fresh to order they specialize in south indian cuisine and everything is vegetarian the place is spotless well lit and air conditioned a big pitcher of water with napkins are also available at all tables which is totally worth the extra few dollars you will pay per dish than at say banana leaf everything was delicious especially the tomato rice dish wish i remembered the name the set meal i had was also good comes with a couple of fluffy pooris white rice daal etc and good value for money i think we have found a new favorite indian spot in singapore,Positive
mtr-1924,most variety for a south indian vegetarian place in singapore everything is made in ghee this adds to the taste but also to the waist everything is good but the place next door has a homely feel and super tasty dosas,Positive
mtr-1924,a friend took me here for lunch today to introduce me to food from his home region i am not familiar with the type of food or even vegetarian food much but i thoroughly enjoyed the meal the staff was friendly and kept asking if i liked their food we tried four different dishes and i generally liked them all i would definitely go back and eat here again great food and great history to the place,Positive
mtr-1924,the dosas both masala rawa were excellent the best part is that the accompanying sambar for each dish be it the dosas or the vada or rawa idli was distinct and each of them were pretty good particularly the accompaniment to rava dosa which was similar to avial the good old sambar was pretty good as well the vada was excellent the rawa idli filter coffee were good overall a very good addition to singapore is indian food scene,Positive
mtr-1924,great place to enjoy indian vegetarian food food is heat and the ordering and delivery is really fast and efficient across between sit down dining and quick service everything seems to be priced at  very clean and new as well,Positive
mtr-1924,my favorite south indian restaurant in singapore so far it is a chain from bangalore and the singapore branch opened earlier this year is the first one outside india their masala dosas are amazing the crispiest and lightest i have had anywhere i have also had a few new dishes i would never had before such as bisele bath which is sort of like a tomatoey rice stew made with rice lentils cashew nuts carrots and other goodness my other favorite is kharabath which is kind of like an indian polenta made from semolina with a bunch of spices the older gentleman who takes your order at the front counter is very helpful and friendly and patiently explains and recommends different dishes he also backs up the talk today he told my friend and me to try their freshly ground coffee instead of just ordering cokes and said if we were not happy with it we should come and see him afterwards thankfully there was no need for fisticuffs with the old dude because the coffee was damn good,Positive
mtr-1924,excellent vegetarian restaurant with amazing bisi bela bhaat good dosas decent idlis ordering is a pain and almost negates all the good the set up is plain silly you will spend ages queueing in the cramped entryway everyone takes ages to decide huge menu several would ay of the week items daily specials complicate things further always sell out of some so you choose and choose again and worse typically gluten free south indian dishes such as idlis and dosas etc have been modified to add rava which is semolina and thus wheat based wish these guys would find someone who could help them fix the simple things that make a great restaurant concept with pretty good food a mediocre experience suggestions if management is listening change ordering location and system add simple descriptions of dishes list ingredients simplify the menu put day of the week dishes and daily specials on a separate one or board let people enjoy the whole experience,Positive
mtr-1924,awesome place fantastic food and great service the quality of the food matches what one is used to back in bangalore love going here and will surely go back there soon,Positive
mtr-1924,one of the best places to have indian vegetarian cuisine spice combinations are delicious prices are very affordable might get a little busy during normal meal hours but definitely worth the wait rawa masala dosa and onion uthappam are highly recommended,Positive
mtr-1924,good place for a south indian breakfast need to order food and pay at the counter before you sit down i do not like such restaurants otherwise i would have given it  stars,Positive
operation-dagger,this is a well hyped speakeasy style cocktail bar located in a subterranean venue that is not super obvious to find google maps gets you pretty close but you have to look for a building marked  ann siang hill and find a black door with a tiny operation dagger sign next to it still it is worth the effort required in finding it while the cocktails are premium priced you are also getting quite a unique sensory experience their menu for example is not the standard listing of drinks and their ingredients instead you will get vague descriptions of the flavor profiles of each drink the bartenders can explain further what ingredients go into them although i was not sober enough to remember what went into mine the cheese no egg for example was described as offering notes of cheddar cream honey and smoke it certainly delivered on the first three parts as the drink was on the surface a chilled almost egg noggy affair served in a small cup but the smoke was what distinguished it the cup containing the actual drink came inside a large glass jar full of nest like material that was set ablaze which created lots of smoke that settled into the drink once the glass jar was closed see the accompanying pictures and videos to get a better sense for what i am talking about the so it was not coffee meanwhile had no hint of coffee whatsoever although it was a strong boozy wake up call that tasted like ginseng but there is no ginseng to it the bartenders explained that it was the interaction of the specific ingredients that created such a strong flavor the space itself is super sexy and is perfect for both intimate affairs and for small groups it is a dimly lit bunker like venue although cocktail purists might not be impressed the novelty of it all made for a very compelling experience,Negative
operation-dagger,this was a complete  from native in terms of atmosphere but yet again the drinks and staff were amazing we walked through an unmarked door and down a set of stairs to a an open bar area that was very industrial and had a canopy of lightbulbs on the ceiling i think we tried almost every drink on the menu we had to stop before the last two because we had an early morning flight out of singapore my favorite was the hot and cold i also tried the red eye bee pollen corn and oil and black attack i cannot remember if these are the correct names of the last two but again as with native these are drinks i have never tasted before i have barely even heard of the ingredients we always had our water glass filled and people checking on us without us having to flag someone down they had hip hop playing in the background and it was pretty full for a wednesday night i want to visit singapore again just to come back here that is how good these drinks are,Positive
operation-dagger,what a crazy and quirky bar i loved the decor here especially those light bulbs overhead i had the hot cold drink and my husband had the gomashio while the cocktails are pricey what alcoholic beverage is not pricey in singapore they are absolutely worth the experience while we were here only for a nightcap i could see myself staying here for a long time everyone seemed very friendly the music was great and the drinks were fantastic,Positive
operation-dagger,wow i was pretty blown away by their cocktails you will literally miss this place if you do not know about it no signboard located in a corner of a building only indication is a glass door and the operation dagger stick figures on top of the door it is down a narrow set of stairs that kinda smells like someon yakked there part of the vibes maybe they have been around for about  years and have this prohibition theme for secret societies and triads of singapore it is a tiny room which could use a little more smart planning but perhaps this is what the space is meant to be we stood and waited for about  mins before a table opened i tried the egg one of their classic signature cocktail served in a tea cup displayed in a glass nest the nest hosts smokey star anises that were flamed and added to the drinks essence i loved the texture of the drink it is like a thick milky emulsion that washes down with its pleasent sweetness at  it is kinda standard for sg hipster mixologist scene i also enjoyed the hot and cold give it a try i will definitely be back to try their other stuff,Positive
operation-dagger,on the outskirts of traditional and touristy chinatown there is this hipster little street on ann siang hill with a darn good selection of bars and if you know me you know i love a good cocktail it was my first time visiting singapore and after getting rejected from a different cocktail bar for wearing flip flops give me a break i am a tourist and it is real hot outside me and a friend ended up at the mysterious operation dagger so mysterious that the entrance is marked only with their logo that you gotta be in the know to recognize the interior is hipster industrial with mood lighting the atmosphere a little more than cold and aloof and the cocktails divine you better be strolling in in your yeezys and supreme which i was not the menu lists only flavor profiles because reallllly the focus should be on cultivating these profiles rather than thinking about whether you are feeling vodka or tequila an appetizer of cucumber pieces in some white creamy stuff served on a stone plate to cleanse the palette my drink was served in a ceramic tea cup with a white chocolate cup and some frozen yuzu balls inside the cup that you are supposed to eat first then drink original definitely unique and very very smooth prices are not cheap but for the experience i would highly highly recommend,Positive
operation-dagger,stars creative cocktail bar in ann siang hill one of my favorites in sg very creative drinks and everything is good personally enjoy the hot and cold and gomashio the bartenders are also very helpful they give great recommendations based on your preferences pricey though  for a small drink location wise a bit hard to sign as there is no obvious sign you have to look for a creatively designed o d symbol at the address specified speakeasy atmosphere,Positive
operation-dagger,had the mocktail version of hot and cold to say it is delicious will be an understatement my first sip of the drink was euphoric the creamy hot white chocolate at the top combined with the cold pineapple at the bottom was heavenly in the mouth coupled with great music dark ambience and rich intellectual conversations you are gonna get an absolutely memorable experience,Positive
operation-dagger,people laugh when i say my saturday night plans consist of drinking alone at a bar with me myself and i i did not let this hold me back as i did deep research into good solo traveler bars so i could continue on my mission to review all the finest food and drink singapore has to offer originally i tried to go to the much talked about  hong kong street but was turned away because they had a private party and i was not invited womp womp of course i had a fall back operation dagger operation dagger is advertised to be kind of secret but also really well known for their cocktails i would say the interwebs has done a great job capturing the essence of this place because that is also exactly how i would describe it i felt silly walking past the door many a time i had dressed up determined to take myself out on the best date of my life and i walked behind the hustle and bustle of club street down a street that no one seemed interested in i nervously hoped i was going the right way and did not look like a total doofus that got all dressed up with nowhere to go at this point i am torn whether or not i should post photos of what the entrance looks like but i have decided not to because finding this place is part of the experience if you cannot find it there are some pretty obvious hints scribbled on building walls so do not worry too much or just google it i opened the unmarked door and walked down a short dark cement staircase that made me think twice about continuing the trek but i did and it was so worth it in an attempt to avoid the crowds i got to the bar a bit past pm right after it opened i had no trouble finding a seat another solo traveler sat at the bar and two larger parties sat at the tables the menu was full of elaborate seeming cocktails that truly seemed unique at prices that i would never pay in america i had just spent  on a regretful singapore sling so i questioned whether i should drop another  on a unique cocktail i did it was great i got the hot cold which is apparently a mix of pineapple lavender white chocolate and coconut i have to say it was one of the best drinks i have ever had ever the cold is the actual drink which is proabably where the pineapple comes into play the hot is the delicious dessert like foam on top which oozes white chocolate and coconut i drank it all dangerously fast and could easily see myself downing four drinks before dinner that is  for those of you counting at home i did not but i wanted to i wanted to try everything on the menu as i saw people around me getting truly fantastical creative drinks made before them like works of art the staff were so kind and committed to their craft they gave me a few tips on which other bars i should check out and i even got a free ginger beer as i waited for a few friends to show up the only downside of this place is that the drink i had did not taste like alcohol at all so i am honestly not sure if there was any in my drink seriously did i order something off the virgin menu this is definitely a place worth a trip or two or three if i lived in singapore it would be a go to date place for me especially since the music is on point i honestly want to try to omakase and see what else od has up their sleeves i will be back for sure maybe even tomorrow night total cost     usd no  ann siang hill b singaporevisa acceptedthis review was copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews,Negative
operation-dagger,that is not a knife there is a good reason why you are not sitting in operation broadsword or operation halberd because those would provide a front on assault to the senses operation dagger is a stab you in the back with the x multiplier fiend who will lure you into the dark and then steal off with your gold purse and giggle with glee as he does so i have been in singapore for   years and have only just visited this bar recently having been to the likes of hk shin gi tai debespoke gibson adrift and countless other fantastic cocktail bars od had a lot to measure up to and it was a big glug of the good stuff short on all counts the first impression is dark and dank which would be ok if there was some sort of atmosphere or vibe the lightbulb conglomeration is interesting for about  minutes before you realise that is the entire theme of the place the menu was extremely short and i am told has not changed in forever which was disappointing to say the least because the drinks are underwhelming i had  drinks from the menu and both were so sweet i almost could not finish them no balance no finesse and certainly no demonstration of mixology expertise i also had one off menu just asking the bartender to make something based on a flavour profile whilst this was marginally better it was still a long way from just a standard negroni i could get in just about any bar in singapore the staff were hit and miss we were attended to quickly upon arrival with menus water but then had to wait significantly to get drink making attention when looking for the next drink we had to wait again there was a distinct air of indifference from the staff they were not disinterested they just seemed to be going through the numbers rather than providing that great vibe and banter that you are looking for in a best bar in asia one is a hard score but i could not go two for three clear reasons firstly od comes with a fair bit of hype being listed on the best bars of asia lists all the time and alongside those esteemed entries it just does not stack up secondly i would never return here or recommend it to anyone it is dank and dark and offers little to no atmosphere other speakeasy type bars even sparse ones offer some sort of thematical nuance to draw you in i cannot imagine any scenario where i would find myself coming here to start middle finish a night lastly it is expensive for what you get i e high end singapore prices for low end cocktails served by indifferent staff in a dark hole in the ground,Negative
operation-dagger,the space is a little cold and bare but the staff and the drinks are great they have a limited menu but this bar is known for creating drinks based on what you feel like drinking just tell the bartender what you like and he she creates a unique drink for you we were presently surprised with how well made our drinks were and the process they took to make them the best by far was a drink called hot cold which consisted of pineapple lavender white chocolate and a coconut foam top,Positive
operation-dagger,i am glad my brother came to visit me otherwise i would not have ventured here on my own od is a very cool speakeasy we came on a thursday night to only two other patrons present but it was still a pretty great atmosphere thanks to the reviewer who mentioned looking for the crown above the door without it we would be lost while i am not one for cocktails i followed the reviews and ordered the off menu hot cold and jesus christ the most amazing cocktail i have had hot foam cold drink a dessert in a cup and granted you really did not taste much alcohol but it is delicious enough to overlook this fact my brother ordered the bee pollen and enjoyed his as well although likely not worth the price point it was regardless the vibe is very nice and i would recommend coming here at least once frequent visitors might find a large hole in their pockets,Positive
operation-dagger,not cheap easily a  to  us dollars but delicious and inventive cocktails in a space that is as cool as any trending speakeasy in new york or la absolutely unpretentious and chill the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable part of the fun is hunting for its hidden entrance so enjoy the search the surrounding area is full of other bars and restaurants so you can easily make it a full night of barhopping,Positive
operation-dagger,as stolen from rachel r if you are looking for a glass of wine or a beer go somewhere else if you want incredibly creative cocktails this is the spot operation dagger was our rd stop on bar crawl in attempt to hit each singapore location on the world is best bar list we arrived right as they opened and enjoyed having the place and the bartenders to ourselves the menu is small but each drink is exceptionally well crafted the space is a little cold and uncomfortable but i ordered the hot and cold and it was the best alcoholic drink i have ever had without a doubt pineapple lavender white chocolate and coconut with a foam top be sure to sip deep enough to get the warm and cold liquids at the same time be sure to ask the bartender is what they recommend they know the menu better than anyone if you are interested in doing a similar bar crawl operation dagger is easy walking distance from the tippling club and exceptionally close to native world is  best bars  manhattan singapore atlas singapore operation dagger singapore  hongkong street singapore tippling club singapore native singapore,Positive
operation-dagger,this underground speakeasy is a must for your singapore adventures i read about it on a couple of sites so i was excited to experience it it is hidden so a little hard to find but there is a discreet crown their logo to help you know identify i was thankful to have a local who knew exactly where it was it is such a unique space once you get in very minimalist decor the huge lightbulb fixture over the bar is really interesting and makes for good pics as well as the liquor in the individual bottles on the wall i definitely fed into the hype but let is be clear this place will make a dent on your wallet with most drinks running at about sgd to sgd,Positive
operation-dagger,if you are looking for a glass of wine or a beer go somewhere else if you want incredibly creative cocktails this is the spot its an unmarked door on the left keep your eyes out for people exciting its quite loud on the weekend but they have great taste in music ask for the off menu hot cold a delicious combo of coconut foam with pineappley deliciousness prepare to become addicted,Positive
operation-dagger,relatively small bar with a cool vibe and unusual and creative drinks we were glad we were able to locate this bar and complete our mission,Positive
operation-dagger,this place really has something special here it is a must go if you love cocktails their bar snacks will beat most restaurants appetizers awesome staff and really intriguing menus,Positive
operation-dagger,it is cool it is a speakeasy but the drinks are ok nothing to write home to mom and dad everything pre mixed and all the staff could care less that we wee there to try out one of you asia is best bars,Positive
operation-dagger,whatever happened just before i went there i am not able to understand any good review for this hole at all besides quite unfriendly barkeepers and the fact that sitting in froint of the sink is definitely not a nice spot the drink that i was offered tasted like a mixture of dishwater and vinegar prepared in a small bowl and garnished with some dry thyme this was far away from anything being good perhaps i did not understand the drink concept perhaps they forgot some ingredients but no this bar will never be a target again,Negative
operation-dagger,the ambience for this bar is awesome love the drinks my favorite was hot cold had snow for starts and then had the bee pollen but that was not to my liking my friend ordered the gomaishio and that was too cucumber and ginger ish for me new york punch was really good toothe drinks are like  each pretty pricey but for the novelty i think it is okay the decor was cool too,Positive
operation-dagger,really like the true speakeasy concept and the interior stylings the drinks are fun inventive and fairly potent a great place to stop in and have a drink or two or eight one of our dear friends was leaving so we decided to visit a couple of watering holes that he had not had the chance to go to of the handful of places we went to this was one of my favorites as soon as we entered we were greeted and drinks were recommended and ordered the air smelled slightly herbal and the drinks delicious the drinks on the menu differed enough to appeal to a variety of palates and the staff are skilled enough to craft something to suit specific palates would definitely come back to chat with friends and relax,Positive
operation-dagger,pretty cool subterranean bar in ann siang hill club street i believe this has been here for a few months and of course i only discovered it thanks to you yelpers this is a true speakeasy in the sense that there is no signboard just a symbol above the door and it is pretty hidden to help you find it it is right behind oxwell co and yes they are related once you enter the ambiance itself is pretty cool and it makes you want to proclaim welcome to my underground lair ala dr evil in austin powers the walls are dark grey they have those clusters of lights reminiscent of the ones in pangaea and some interesting art a lot of the alcohol is specially made so be sure to ask the knowledgeable bartender about what is available the cocktail menu is pretty short but they can definitely do bespoke if you would like i tried the sugarcane and if i recall correctly it had spices like chili and cinnamon so it definitely packed a punch i could not taste much alcohol then again it seems their style is to make it that way prices are typical at   when i visited my colleague and i were the only ones there but i am pretty sure it fills up eventually great chill bar to start out the evening,Positive
operation-dagger,two visits in and i have tried every drink on the menu on my most recent visit i find something new genmaishio and it is up there with hot cold and snow as my faves true they are not the strongest drinks on the world but they are mighty tasty and if you go on a weekday night you will have the pick of the bar for seats and might even get some puffed mixed rice for bar snacks go and then you do not have to wish you were like the cool kids,Positive
operation-dagger,operation dagger a speakeasy with a hint of mad scientist potential located in a basement next to the famous club street the stairway to the bar is hidden behind a simple glas door the only identification is the small logo unnoticeable if you are not looking for it we were out on a saturday night and surprisingly there was not that mich movement in and out to give away what is inside the decor is industrial meets scandinavian minimalism read upper class hipster there are not that many seats but the space is airy despite being in a cellar and i could imagine standing around would not be too laborious there is a long bar with shelfs and shelfs of ingredients in plain brown bottless i spot a past acquaintance from my days working for a paint company a bottle of titanium dioxide white pigment i cant believe they use that for drinks should not be dangerous but yuk and wonder what else is in the jars there is a laboratory next to the bar area which i suspect is where the magic is invented byt the house drinks maste the drinks list is small but creative with around   interesting cocktails and some beers we went for a sugarcane with some chili cinammon and pineapple flavors a hot n cold that is more like a liquid dessert and the mulled wine which is pretty much what the name suggests but prepared in a syphon with some impressive flame action all the drinks are very good and i am almost disappointed we dont have time for another round price wise operation dagger is equivalent to other nice cocktail bars in singapore with prices of around  sgd  its not cheap but it is worth it staff are friendly and take time to prepare your drinks this is a perfect place for an after dinner drink or a kick start to a club night,Negative
operation-dagger,i like this place a lot but mainly for the atmosphere the drinks are not very strong so do not come here expecting to catch a buzz or get drunk unless you have a secret flask in your purse a date brought me here on a saturday night and i am such a sucker for speakeasy type places no way in hell could i find my way back here not in a million years and i was completely sober when i walked in the door lol the place is small but definately started to get busy as the night went on i had one of the coctails with cucumber and vodka and salt it was good but i tasted zero alcohol which is weird for a craft cocktail place usually the drinks are super strong they have a good selection of concoctions and beer a really good place to start your night but not stay the whole night what i loved was while i was waiting for the bathroom there was a small tv screen in the corner which looked like it was a camera in the bathroom of the bar it showed a girl doing coke off the toliet hilarious the owners must have quite a dark sense of humor which i found entertaining all in all a good place to take a date it is quiet enough to talk or a quick drink prior to going out on club street,Negative
operation-dagger,operation dagger is one of those secretive speakeasy type of bars perhaps a bit silly of me but i do like the concept when i first visited it was perhaps a bit more secret but these days it almost seems common knowledge that they are there it is located in a basement on ann siang hill look for the small logo over the door i like the design of the place as it is very sleek and a bit industrial in feel there is actually a lot of space downstairs and while a bit dark it still does not feel as if you are in a basement bar there is a short cocktail list that rotates fairly frequently and everything i have tried on it has always been very interesting and exciting and most of the time also very good price wise they are not cheap but around   sgd for a good cocktail is the normal price level at good places in singapore and for the quality they deliver here i find it well worth it the service is friendly and they know their stuff when it comes to cocktails great place to head for a few cocktails and surprisingly it has never really been full when i have been here,Positive
operation-dagger,innovative spins wacky creations churned out from the crazy scientist lab experimental and refreshing love this place walk down the flight of steps to get here,Positive
operation-dagger,love love love the cocktails here i guess u cannot have too much of a good thing these babies go for  a pop drinks in singapore are so expensive faint they have a cucumber drink that is very interesting it is like chicken rice in a cup sesame ginger and cucumber kinda refreshing and savory at the same time the egg drink is kinda like that too salty to start and finishes sweet hot and cold was really amazing too it was like drinking a cup of honey i felt cozy and happy having that they do not tell you what sort of alcohol goes in there i feel they are not generous with the alcy but pack on tastebud surprises i will be back on payday,Positive
operation-dagger,great speakeasy with amazing drinks knowledgeable and friendly bartenders and a nice industrial chic interior this is my go to when i want to impress friends the speakeasy concept makes it feel exclusive it never gets too crowded so it feels intimate and the drinks are just delicious and innovative,Positive
operation-dagger,given its location premise and price point you would expect more beautiful people to be here having a tipple or two instead you will be drinking with a motley crew of older gentlemen banker dudes and other office lady types that was the crowd that i encountered on to the main event the drinks they are light unusual and just the right level of gimmicky i was not impressed by the sugarcane i felt that they did not layer the flavours enough for it to be interesting i know how wanky i sound right now the egg is a tasty little salted egg based cocktail that is smoked in a jar with star anise and hay yep you get the picture not the place you wanna go if you are looking for a good old fashioned or whiskey sour parting shot do not miss the nibbles not enough to fill you up but they will amuse your tastebuds nonetheless lighter than paper kale crisps and flaxseed chips with a vinegar mist will have you hankering for more,Negative
operation-dagger,first timer love the concept staffs are very charmingly friendly cocktail list was very interesting only one thing i would pick up con is that cocktail tasted like almost nonalcoholic so weak but very expensive,Negative
operation-dagger,best speakeasy and best cocktails in singapore hands down bartenders are very knowledgable and can make amazing custom drinks,Positive
operation-dagger,this is one of the best places worldwide for craft cocktails service was over the top and they took great time to explain the drinks and the bar concept this is not your normal cocktail bar and you wo not get standard drinks here but what you do get is spectacular they do not use the standard commercial liquors they use their own they make everything there and they use the ingredients very well they even have a nitrogen martini where they use liquid nitrogen to cool the drink not only cool but was very tasting if you like craft and very unique cocktails this is your place get there early as it is a small space part of the attraction is the search for the place it is a true speakeasy which adds to the charm we will be going back,Positive
operation-dagger,the first rule of operation dagger is that you do not discuss operation dagger but if you happen to discover a bar at the bottom of the steps through a non descript door and they eventually tell you the name you will not be disappointed the service is great and you know the staff really enjoy experimenting it is basically a bunch of chemistry nerds making really cool drinks and their menu has been know to change through out the night i will warn you if you are expecting normal beers wine and other drinks super quick cocktails and no experience do not waste you time but if you want to get out of the box and have a chili rum punch totally worth  bucks stop in and let your taste buds get an exercise,Positive
operation-dagger,i get hungry drinking here the flavors are extremely unique as they resemble food more than cocktails i almost forget that there is any alcohol content until the end when it suddenly hits a little hard to find but just ask neighboring oxwell i am impressed by the taste obviously owners put a lot of effort into creating these flavors well worth a visit,Positive
operation-dagger,tried man vs pig and it was really strange savory and tasted funky and not in a good way my friend got the genmaishio and it was alright minimalist design and empty likely because it was a wednesday night had high hopes given reviews and lists of best bars in singapore but was a little underwhelmed could not taste the alcohol and the huge ice cube had to be removed before i could drink it,Negative
smith-street-taps,located on the nd floor of the  building in chinatown singapore you will not stumble upon this beer bar out of coincidence you will probably have to ask   people the location and address before you even get close to the proximity of this bar once you find it you have yourself one of the top beer bars in all of singapore i visited smith street taps on three separate occasions during my one week trip they are constantly rotating their taps and have very friendly helpful bartenders there are also many options for food as this bar is tucked away between food markets if you make it here on the weekend they have opened another location  meters away that serve local singaporean craft beer the name of this is smith street taps friends and you cannot miss it i also was able to host two bottle shares with local friends who i met with in copenhagen two years ago the international craft beer scene is always friendly inviting and you never know who you will see again down the road i would venture to smith street taps if you have a free night on the weekend,Positive
smith-street-taps,this place makes a colorado guy feel right at home with a great selection of beers to choose from they also have a gluten reduced beer that my wife can drink who has a mild sensitivity to wheat so that is a win too seriously check this place out for quality beer on tap and excellent service as well the satay around the corner makes for a tasty snack also,Positive
smith-street-taps,smith streets taps as others have mentioned has a great selection of beer on tap and quite a few bottles the best part the hawker stalls come here to enjoy cheap food while drinking delicious brew the service is always very friendly and the owner knows a lot about beer and great places to drink highly recommend,Positive
smith-street-taps,nice spot in the hawker center they have a lot of imported beers they had some from australia hong kong and the uk they had a big variety i had a pineapple sour from australia the beers here are a bit more pricey compared to the other beer stall these are around s  it is pretty popular lots of tourists worth a stop for some good beers,Positive
smith-street-taps,wow great find in china town they have a load of beer on tap and in bottles on tap from singapore uk and u s they face smith street on the nd level nice breeze and food all around in the hawker stand the owner is nice but ray who works there is awesome chat him up for his lore knowledge on beer most beers ran,Positive
smith-street-taps,wow beer o clock fo sho superb selection of import beers at almost reasonable prices stone ipa for  can you believe it it would be amazing if there was a bbq smokehouse hawker stall next door but i can dream or order uber eats to deliver decker to the hawker center,Positive
smith-street-taps,finally awesome beer place knowledgeable staff i am finally home this place carries even the most obscure beers they even have modern times on rotation that is like the most niche of all san diego beers i had a great conversation with the owner so cool to speak beer to someone here on the island i love the fact that this place is in he chinatown hawker center of all places i will be coming back again and again since they have a rotation selection of great craft brew thank you smith street you have saved me,Positive
smith-street-taps,i really wanted to have craft beer under ac but looking at  perfect reviews here it was hard to resist giving it a shot it is not so hot at night anyway and there is plenty of seating bottles at the good beer company taps here take your pick a ml glass is   the usual in singapore cannot help the alcohol tax the selection is great as amply detailed in the other reviews service is very fast the biggest difference compared to a typical crafts beer place is that you are sitting in what is probably the largest hawker in singapore with over  stalls so you can eat whatever you want and it will cost very little maybe a tenth of what you would normally pay for your hipster bbq or quinoa salad or mexican several of the stalls are well known so just google chinatown complex stalls before you head out although we had no bad experiences in the evening the queues are much better chilling out with great hawker food a glass of cold craft beer in the hand on a warm quiet night just a couple mrt stops from home the cbd towers lit up in the distance it is a pretty good experience and i think we will be back often,Positive
smith-street-taps,what is going on in the chinatown food complex there are two of the best places for craft beers in the country almost next to each other this place does also have excellent selection friendly and knowledgeable staff they have their beers on tap rotating selection and prices are very reasonable to be in singapore as with the good beer company it is a plus that one can grab cheap and mostly good food from the surrounding food stalls,Positive
smith-street-taps,in direct proximity of the phenomenal good beer company is another stand that creates a dynamic duo of drunken deliciousness where gbc has bottles sst has rotating drafts most of which are solid winners even in the sweltering heat hearing a nearby stand blast chinese pop music from broken speakers i feel transported back to boston if only for a moment it is my cure for homesickness looking forward to my next treatment,Negative
smith-street-taps,i am so glad that i decided to come back here because this is certainly one of those places that you really have to check out if you happen to be in singapore if you are getting sick of being offered the standard beers such as tiger or even simply paying through the nose then make your way down to the chinatown complex and check this place out though it does not open until about   pm this and it is sister the good beer company are one of those secrets of singapore that unless you are either in the know or simply a gun and locating things on the internet or you simply jump on yelp and type in bars you would probably end up missing this place and if you are a beer connoisseur then you will simply have to make you way back here where the good beer company serves bottles this place serves beers on tap and from what i am told it is even rotated okay you do have to put up with the fact that it is in a hawker centre but then again those places are pretty cool in and of themselves this place just makes them even better,Positive
smith-street-taps,the good beer company has metastasized apparently the owner daniel was no longer able to live with the limitation of the bottle only format so he teamed up with meng chao brewers craft and opened a second nearby stall with taps singapore is first draft beer only hawker stall i have stopped by a few times since their recent soft opening and i am thrilled currently they have  rotating taps with great offerings so far i have seen rogue deschutes hitachino nest and jungle beer and they always keep sapporo on tap if you want something light the price is right starting at  for the sapporo and going up to  for the craft beer no food of course but it is in the chinatown complex smith street hawker center so it is surrounded by excellent food stalls,Positive
smith-street-taps,drunk review jush kidding do not tell your friends about thish place just bring them here excellent beers and they will fill your growler too,Positive
smith-street-taps,after trekking around the food court for an hour and been given directions to taps on smith i finally found it but it was closed so pay attention to both the stall number and business hours but i came back at  pm to enjoy there lovely fruit saison while worth the wait,Negative
smith-street-taps,smith street taps is the real deal craft beer for the people at a people friendly price bosses daniel and meng chao are very knowledgeable and the modest tap selection is tightly edited and balanced to offer something for novices and hardcore hopheads check out their facebook page before dropping by to see what is on tap,Positive
smith-street-taps,blk  smith street chinatown complex is massive but what really sets this place apart are the number of excellent beer stalls here it takes awhile to go through the maze but you are rewarded by  solid options of which smith street taps was my favorite they carry a line of approximately  craft beers ranging from hoppy american ipas to german wheat beer to japanese craft beers prices are at least   cheaper than at a proper restaurant or bar so if you deal with the heat and minimal amenities this is the place to go plus you can order just about anything in terms of food so that is a plus too although i would to have some good tacos here my friend and i made it through half of the beers here and our fave was the  hop ipa by deschutes the selection changes frequently so do not get too attached to a certain beer but the line up is always interesting the two guys running the place are super friendly and knowledgeable hint take good note of the stall number unless you need the exercise definitely a gem and a great find in singapore,Positive
smith-street-taps,smith street taps is a hidden gem in the singapore beer scene taps rotate with a mixture of micro brews and old world draught beers the staff are knowledgeable and friendly,Positive
smith-street-taps,this is the sister stand of good beer company ran by the same owner and with an amazing selection of beer on tap they always have some really rare stuff including some whisky barrel aged and bourbon barrel aged beer this week from the u s but the selection almost always has some japanese some german and a mix of uk and nz,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,i came across man man some time ago while walking from duxton road to keong saik road i only mention this bit of information because man man is tucked in the back of a shophouse which faces keong saik road while man man itself faces a pedestrian access path park that people typically use as a shortcut despite it is hidden location apparently queues here for their dinner service can reach up to an hour or more having just had lunch there i hate lining up i can see why people go through the trouble of waiting at the top of the steps and just inside the glass doors leading into man man are  large thigh high tanks with water flowing into them these tanks are home to live anguilla japonica japanese eels or once grilled unagi it is quite fitting that one is first encounter upon stepping foot into man man is the main course because it truly is the star of the show here the restaurant has tables spread out in the oddly shaped space along with a bar counter that faces both the chopping board where the eels presumably shuffle off their mortal coil and the binchotan grill where they get transformed into unagi the menu features several types of hitsumabushi a specialty of nagoya city unadon and smaller side dishes such as unagi cooked in tamago i settled on a large unadon which was served within   minutes and was the perfect size for lunch without going into too much detail not all unagi is created equal and sometimes you end up with something that has the consistency and texture of chewing on a rubber hose this is not the case at man man where they serve the real deal and which is the perfect combination of flaky meat combined with the slight crunchy chewiness of the charred skin barring a plane trip to japan this is one of the most authentic unagi meals you will ever have anywhere with my benchmark being marushizu in tokyo coming to a total of s   after service and tax it is also a lot cheaper than that plane ticket for that price you will not leave hungry as the unagi is served on a generous portion of rice with a small tofu appetizer gari pickled ginger and a bowl of suimono clear soup along with a cup of cold barley tea the only thing i recommend is asking for the sansho pepper as a touch of the ground pepper really rounds out the flavor of the unagi oh and they have takeaway too if you really hate lining up,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,we came here at   pm on a monday and there was no line taste   if you love unagi your dream will come true really flavorful unagi perfect sauce on top and perfectly bbq the level of attention to its detail is great love the fresh wasabi you are getting for you to make fresh wasabi yourself price value   for a midsize set you pay s  and for a large set s  yes it is more expensive than hawker center but you get quality food and we are talking about unagi a fresh wasabi a soup and you get a good portion of it i would recommend the large size if you crave unagi i ordered the midsize one and regretted after the first bite to not have taken the large size onethis place is perfect for lunch or generally if you just want to get food quickly it is not a place for a candle light dinner where you sit for hours we would come here again for sure,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,easy to get to from the mrt when i got here there was a long line in the rain but the unagi was so worth it by far the best unagi i have had the unagi was so fresh delicate yet we will flavored there are freshwater eels in the restaurant in a tank so i am guessing thats how the freshness is maintained the bento don let is you experiment with how you want to eat it with soup wasabi seaweed sauces or all of the above it is a little pricey at  but definitely worth it when you feel like treating yourself,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,man man is a very well known restaurant in singapore and i can definitely see why now the unagi here is some of the best that i have ever had just know that the queue can get quite long so i would recommend showing up before it opens otherwise you will end up waiting outside in the heat this place is a bit pricey as well you will probably spend around s  per person here food unagi hitsumabushi this is basically an unagi don set with a broth that you can pour on to the rice plus miso soup i would definitely recommend adding the broth as well which mixes fantastically with the taste of the unagi i got this in the regular size and this was plenty of food for me unagi bone crackers we got this as an appetizer and it was surprisingly good the crackers are very crispy and had a nice smokey taste to them wait i arrived at  am on a saturday for lunch it opens at   and waited about min i have heard the line can definitely get over an hour so would recommend going early if possible,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,definitely something to get when you missed the unagi don from japan their hitsumabashi is really what you will get at japan totally in love with the crispy soft texture good stuff that is worth our time to queue for it,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,be prepared to queue for a long time for this place but it is completely  worth it because eating here was spiritual experience for me all the ingredients are so fresh the taste of everything is perfect the unagi is so crispy yet tender because it is grilled to perfection they give you real wasabi to grate and that was so delicious i honestly savored every bite i could eat this every day,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,man oh man what a unagi place ever since i watched friends i have been wanting to eat japanese unagi but all past attempts were just soso even in japan and in my opinion could never compete with western eel dishes however as i am a sucker for japanese food i had to give unagi one more try thank god i did because the hitsumabushi set eel three ways is one of the most delicious meals i had in a long time i had the large set it was way too much food but i still finished all since it was so good aaaaaand although the restaurant is super busy the service is awesome all wait staff is mega friendly and attentive yes for regular tea top ups so delicious food and awesome service  stars worth the hype,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,extremly delightful i was visiting my gf in sg and she took me to this unagi heaven the signature menu with seaweed soup is worth to have if you are planning to visit sg this is where you must go,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,oooooh nagiand so the  michelin singapore guide is out with a bunch of new entries and new recommendations one of them man man japanese unagi restaurant i have heard the reviews i have seen the queues and i have to admit my first reaction was crazy i wo not queue for that how wrong i was if not for my colleague suggesting man man for a group dinner i might have never gone to try it despite my love for unagi  tip if you are going to be arriving anytime after  pm be prepared to wait we got there at  pm our office is pretty nearby and still ended up being the  th group in the queue the restaurant is small and cozy and really reminds you of japan what makes this restaurant different from other restaurants serving unagi the unagi is freshly killed skewered and grilled in the restaurant medium donburi   we decided to go with the basic although the sight of everyone having the hitsumabushi made us regret that decision a bit oh well gives me a reason to come back after one bite all i could say was life changing what ever idea i had of what a good unagi should be and taste like went completely out the window the sauce was flavourful without overpowering the natural sweetness of the eel and the eel oh my it was tender juicy it melts in your mouth and tasted so pure i cannot even find the right words to describe it bottom line i can see why it received its bib gourmand only draw back would be the queue but despite that it still easily gets  stars from me,Negative
man-man-japanese-unagi,man man unagi stands out in singapore as a restaurant that is passionate about serving quality authentic chargrilled unagi at accessible prices the entrance is humbly tucked in a back alley that you might not notice if you were not looking for it as you walk in you are greeted by nothing less than two pools of live unagi i like a restaurant that knows what they stand for and is not shy about it around  pm on a thursday there was not too much of a line and we were seated almost immediately most of the tables are cozy which is typical of a japanese restaurant so smaller groups are more ideal most come here to try unagi three ways and that is exactly what i got the butamabushi for s   the unagi was so fresh and perfectly basted basically the three ways are unagi with rice unagi mixed with the side ingredients seaweed scallion and wasabi and lastly unagi with the ingredients and with a soup dashi broth you actually divide the serving into four parts and the last part is eaten in your favorite way my favorite was with seaweed and a hint of wasabi the refillable ice green tea was also very welcome and i am glad they did not pinch on small things like drinks we also got a small side dish of unagi bone crackers for s  which probably was not necessary but it was different and fun bravo for going all out on unagi by sourcing and preparing it like nobody else in singapore,Negative
man-man-japanese-unagi,they basically do one thing here and it is eel also it is really good i mean really really good there will probably be a line formed outside at any time of the day do not hesitate to wait in that line because the absolutely fresh barbecued eel on rice is worth it they have a tank of eels in the restaurant and so your meal was probably swimming  minutes before you ate it the portion is good sized but not huge so at least order the medium size eel rice bowl which is about  us,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,the restaurant was the latest by chef teppei interestingly the entrance to the place was at the back reached the place about  minutes before it opened and there was a queue of about  persons in front of me the  counter seats were the first to fill up the place was quite smoky one could even smell the smoky grilling smell before entering the place the place was decorated in a light wooden look by the way i did see a customer who bought a couple of fresh eels back too tables were placed quite near to each other there was barely place for bags but lucky i selected a table by the shelf therefore got place in the shelf for bag on the table there was condiments such as sweet sauce unagi sauce spicy japanese pepper and chilli powder to help yourself to refillable iced tea was served kimoyaki liver   looked quite charred it was chewy with smoky although it was a tab bitter at certain parts yahatamaki   unagi roll stuffed with pickled radish in it crunchy and tangy large kouhaku histsumabushi   unagi served with mentaiko sauce soup pickles broth spices the dish was a january special to eat histsumabushi divide the serving into  parts  have one serving in the small bowl which is also known as torizara to enjoy the dish in its original tasteyakumi second serving add the yakumi condiments such as fresh wasabi chopped spring onions and green onions i spend quite a lot of time busy grating the wasabi the fresh wasabi really peaked up the dish  third serving add the lightly flavored dashi made from simmering fish or meat broth the dish reminded one of teochew porridge  eat the last serving the way you like best as for me i like it with the broth and freshly grated wasabi in it the layer of mentaiko sauce was a tab too little to make a different to the dish although there was long queue most customers finished their meals quite fast,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,love this place a lot they import their live unagi from japan and they guarantee that this is the cheapest place to enjoy japanese unagi in sg my partner had the kabayaki unagi set   and i had the shiraiyaki set with the same price the unagi tasted really really fresh my partner and i agreed that man man unagi tasted better than the one in japan with one michelin star we also had mini unagi with vinegar as appetizer really nice but a bit too salty and tamago which was really fluffy delicious i was also lucky because i did not have to queue as i came during odd hour otherwise be prepared to wait at least an hour location a little hidden but the area outside the restaurant is very conducive for queuing me thinks,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,really nicely chargrilled unagi shipped in weekly from japan and grilled by a team of japanese pretty authentic experience however do not think the broth meal is worth getting not too much a difference for the three different ways you can have the unagi and rice then again we were not porridge people  odd for a meal hearty and nice though long crowds expected due to the small restaurant tucked in keong siak worth the wait though,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,the best unagi i have ever eaten i did not know about this place until my friend recommended to me you wo not miss this place with its long queue outside the entrance everyone is orderly with a small number queuing right outside the door and an empty passage way for pedestrians to walk through then the longer queue starts so do not be deceived if you only see a few people at the door my friend and i waited an hour which would have been longer if we were a bigger group the place is pretty small which explains the long queue we got a seat near the counter where they prepared the food we were lucky to face the side of grilling the unagi instead of the side of slicing the unagi which was quite a bloody and unpleasant sight you can also choose not to look up and just dig into your food the unagi had really crispy skin and tender meat to justify the waiting time to myself i ordered the medium portion which was definitely filling and satisfying we each paid about  which is value for money given the quality and portion of the food service was also polite and pretty attentive,Negative
man-man-japanese-unagi,what a sinful saturday this is my second attempt to dine in this restaurant first time i quit because the queue was ridiculously long and i determined that i would succeed this time the dinner starts at pm we arrived at pm and we were the second in the queue less than mins another  more group arrived and by  pm i could not see the tail of queue at all not exaggerating it is really loooooooong queue it is a small restaurant and if you miss the first round it will take another hr to come to your turn they do not limit the time means you can eat as slow as you want the unagi is so delicious it is so fresh as they slaughter the eels on the spot it is so yummy that the price is no longer important the staffs are very friendly and know very well the food they serve i ordered hitsumabushi and i love it i am not a porridge person but i am really falling in love with this one my favorite is adding the unagi rice to the soup and sprinkle the spring onion and seaweed and i like to grate some fresh wasabi on top the price range is  per person reasonable for this quality,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,having lived in nagoya i really miss hitsumabushi or grilled eel eaten several ways e g with rice with wasabi with soup etc my benchmark for hitsumabushi is atsuta horaiken in nagoya so it is quite high so i was excited to hear from my japanese salon that a place specializing in hitsumabushi opened up nearby i finally had a chance to check out man man and i can say that the experience exceeded expectations sure it helps that the eels are shipped live from the nagoya region but the execution of the dish also was excellent with just the right amount of sauce and char service was also excellent and no service fee either the place fills up quickly on weekdays for lunch but seems to also empty fairly quickly so if you would like to avoid a queue come a bit later around  definitely a great addition to the japanese food scene in singapore,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,wow it was my first time and i wow the suitable word in describing what i had my hr queuing is paid off the grilled unagi is sooo tasty and chewy the unagi sauce tastes really good make sure that you have it on definitely will come back again,Positive
man-man-japanese-unagi,a very small restaurant that specialises in eel rice the food gets five stars the eel is chargrilled to perfection and served on a bed of short grained white rice with a side of fresh wasabi the price is reasonable for the quality this place does not take reservations so wait times can be long the line that forms outside the restaurant on the park connector makes it awkward for others using the park connector the ventilation of the restaurant is also wanting you will leave smelling like grilled fish,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,dining here was a real treat i enjoyed the venue so much located inside a large contemporary museum it is not often you get to walk thru a closed museum so quiet then into an intimate bustling and oh so charming restaurant like this it is a step back in time with history lining the walls in framed photos and culture embodied in the gorgeous chandeliers and artworks a classy night out so dress up a bit to feel part of the ambiance service was some of the friendliest we have had anywhere host made excellent suggestions we enjoyed every dish reservations normally a requisite though we got lucky arriving without because a party had finished early and they graciously accommodated us,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,i think we had the miss here in the hit or miss situation i was at a work holiday party a few weeks ago and learned my colleague next to me at dinner used to live in singapore he told me to eat here and order buah keluak ayam as it would change my life i made reservations for dinner which we had last night when i mentioned to people we were going here there was a lot of hype someone said the chef is a national treasure the concierge at our hotel said she has not been able to get into the restaurant as a local and was surprised i was able to secure a reservation the anticipation was really high our chinatown tour guide also shared with us about the peranakan people and culture to prepare us for peranakan cuisine when we arrived the host expected us asking lisa first he seated us at a table in a high traffic area but we moved to a quiet side space the restaurant is not very big so that might be why the reservations are hard to get it turns out my mom was sitting in the same seat michelle obama had been sitting in  days prior as the host shared a photograph of her sitting at the table with him shaking barack obama is hand we started with this fried tofu skin stuffed with crab shrimp chicken and water chestnuts it was kind of like an over fried shrimp toast my mom suggested for our dishes my mom ordered butter prawns i got the buah keluak ayam and eric r ordered the beef rendang the server recommended nasi lemak coconut rice for eric r and my mom and jasmine rice for my dish when the dishes came out eric r was the lucky one his had a lot of flavor and spice and we all liked it his beef was also very tender my mom is dish was prawns in shell that were not cleaned with very little flavor topped with egg floss which was not mentioned when she asked questions about the dish the server warned me that the dish i ordered some people love it and some people do not but i was adamant that i must see if it will change my life the story of the buah keluak ayam is chicken stewed in a sauce with the buah keluak a swamp based nut that is a poisonous fruit only the peranakan people know how to cook it without killing people it holds hydrogen cyanide which has been used in chemical weapons the peranakan people scoop out the center of the fruit ferment it underground in ash for  days and put it back in then boil it to remove the poison a demitasse spoon was provided to scoop out this nut and mix it with my rice which was adorned with fried shallots then drizzle some sauce and supposedly i would have some sort of food nirvana unfortunately the buah keluak did not taste like the truffle of the swamp as i had hoped it would based on my colleague is enthusiasm for the dish we also were essentially ignored by staff through much of the experience and with tiny water glasses we were often without drink eric r is dish was very spicy so he asked a server to leave a pitcher of waster but the server refused eventually we were served a complimentary warm tapioca cake with palm sugar syrup coconut milk and coconut ice cream to cool eric r is mouth and perhaps make up for poor service the best parts of the meal were the rendang and the dessert we left a bit disappointed with the experience given all of the hype but it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to try peranakan food so now we can say we did,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,the decor of this place is on point you can definitely find an instagram moment here the server who greeted us was very friendly and handsome he seated us and then ended up being our server too it is a pretty small place but i imagine that he was spread a little thin he maintained a helpful and friendly vibe throughout the whole meal and we were there pretty late in the evening i ordered a drink called a haliatini which was probably the best drink that i have had since i can remember the price is pretty standard for singapore probably even a little less given that this is a nice restaurant we ordered the chicken wings and satay to start both were excellent the wings came with this spicy fishy sauce and the peanut sauce with the satay was on another level for main courses we got the daging chabek beef cheeks and the garam assam fish both had some much flavor some spicy heat and everything else very well balanced and all of that was the perfect amount of food for two people who heavily eat for the price point this place is worth it the only negative criticism that i have to say is that the napkins are paper which kind of makes it feel like it is not as nice as it is but since this is in a museum i am guessing that it is because washing cloth napkins might not be a feasible option a very small detail and in the end who cares especially because i recently got yelled at somewhere else gaggan for being too messy on my cloth napkin,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,the national gallery is a treat to be walking around and even more so when you find yourself in a gastronomic beckoning called the national kitchen black panels with gold trims and a strangely harmonious cacophonyof floor tiles the atmosphere is elegantly singaporean the black leather upholstered seats however is in a sad state of disrepair and really needs to be replaced the back of my thighs were constantly reminded of how beat up they are food good end of story solid mustard green duck soup just right amount of sour kueh pie tee is a generous helping  altogether unlike candlenut with its skimpy  and of course i showed up for the buah keluak noodles could have sworn this was called buah keluak spaghetti at the bt timah branch and it did not disappoint noodles was al dente and buah keluak sufficient there was an undertone of coconut milk solid service,Negative
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,nice old school classy restaurant food is good but i do not think it is worth the price to pay for the food ordered the coronation chicken appetizer cod with laksa sauce and the eggplant sambal the service was really good and attentive once i actually got to order it was a little slow to start overall i think it is a good place to visit once to see what the hype is all about if i was to return i do not think i would immediately return here,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,what a treat had some time and a colleague took me here the service is very stately though friendly the decor gorgeous and if you can spare the time take a look at the various displays its not a lot but still enjoyable to peruse the food is flavorful complex and delicious the presentation is also very appealing we ordered the sambal eggplant if you like eggplant get this also had the fried bean curd salad definitely ensure you add the cucumber papaya julienne on top of the bean curd with that rich deep sauce and let the flavor explosion begin we had several other dishes all wonderful unfortunately as i was visiting i do not recall all the names the server was also very helpful as he heard our initial order and mentioned it would be a lot of food and helped us pare down vs focusing solely on getting the largest order,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,nice ish singaporean traditional food in the national galleryfood tastes pretty good though a bit sweet overall details by dishes below beef rendang very tender perhaps even slightly too tender for our liking satay well grilled a good starter dried laksa an interesting take on the classic sg dish the dried version does not short change the laksa taste at all still retains that fragrance and touch of spicebeautiful ambiance a good spot to bring out of town guests,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,there are two words that should describe this place dry laksa the preparation of this singaporean staple is simply phenomenal with a burst of many unbelievable flavors that have spice tanginess and light sweetness of the coconut all of which merge to create a dish with an unbelievable flavor profile admittedly i will not call myself a laksa expert as i was in singapore quite briefly but i do know a mouthwatering preparation of a dish when i try one this is an absolute must the establishment as a very beautiful interior and is located in the national gallery thus there is a museum like feel to the entire establishment it is grand and beautiful but dishes are priced very fairly and not over the top as many restaurants in singapore would be with this type of ambiance our waitress was pleasant and attentive giving great recommendations from the menu to help newbies into singapore food scene get oriented quickly i really enjoyed the singapore sling here as well the cocktail was made with great proportions and was a perfect refreshment for a warm summer evening it is unique flavor and festive appearance can serve as a complementing detail to an otherwise very grand environment aside from the dry laksa tried a couple more dishes and was very impressed tau hu goreng fried bean curd with cucumber and bean sprouts topped with peanut sauce interesting dish despite its simplicity but cannot say it was to my flavor profile personally kayu pie tee fried rolls with bamboo quite delicious and unique a flavor unlike anything one would experience in the western world there is no wonder that this restaurant sits in the michelin guide for singapore it is a phenomenal combination of elegance authenticity and reasonable pricing,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,i stopped by this place to get some afternoon desserts with my family friend after walking around the national gallery we got  desserts and the chicken satay although there was a little too much chicken skin for me the satay had really tender meat and seasoned pretty well the kueh beng kah was a sticky cake with nice coconut and caramel flavors the pilot hitam was my favorite it is black glutinous rice with coconut milk and coconut ice cream the rice stew is not as thick as other places but i liked how i could the coconut flavors really came out especially with the ice cream the hot rice with the cold ice cream gave the dessert a nice twist the service was great i remember a server brought us bowls to share our dessert before we even asked him to the decor is really classy with mirrors all around and hints of gold but also has elements of traditional south east asian architecture like bamboos apparently the menus are different at each location so i would want to try out their other dishes next time,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,violet oon is a renowned chef in singapore specializing in peranakan cuisine which blends chinese dishes with southeast asian spices and cooking techniques the cuisine has a large base in malay food such as the rending and coconut milk is a major ingredient in many entrees dishes from northern malaysia have more of a thai influence while those from malacca and singapore carry more of an indonesian influence this cuisine is the finest of asian fusion turmeric chicken wings a plant of the ginger family which is prominent in indian and se asian cuisines this deep orange color powder is an essential ingredient of curries by itself it has a very distinct aroma and flavor which is peppery and slightly bitter coated in a thin layer of turmeric batter with a hint of lemongrass and deep fried to perfection these wings were some of the best that i have ever had beef rendang this se asian rendition of a beef stew was packed with explosive flavors and was served in a rich and spicy hot creamy coconut sauce the beef was melt in your mouth tender the sauce carried just the prefect level of heat for me slightly burning hot but not overwhelming i think the coconut milk had a soothing effect and made the heat more enjoyable spoon a healthy portion over steamed rice and enjoy this foodie is dream come true dry laksa laksa is a rice noodle shaped almost like spaghetti and is often served with soup just like chinese noodle soups the dry version however was soupless but was instead sauted in a delicious house gravy this dish also carried robust and explosive flavors that were stimulating to the palate the deveined and deshelled prawns that came with it were tasty and fresh kueh beng kah if there is something known as a life changing dessert then this must be it this tapioca cake looked innocently like an ordinary slice of cheesecake but was actually a slice of heaven in disguise the cake had a good balance between softness and springiness was browned on the top but moist inside it was mildly but not overly sweet perfect and had a refreshing and delightful taste it was topped with gula melaka palm sugar syrup and served with a side of warm coconut milk,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,fish lovers paradise if you love fish or shellfish you will love this restaurant it is inside the national gallery building on the nd floor attentive waitstaff lovely ambiance dcor food beautifully presented and served family style some dishes are spicier than others so start slowly be aware if anyone in your group has a shellfish allergy i booked a group of  and we had a set menu,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,ok so after getting in some history i was treated to this wonderfully appointed restaurant i enjoyed the authentic food although some of the dishes were too spicy for me if you have a high tolerance for spicy you may love it,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,violet oon is a hometown proud celebrity chef and national kitchen is her dedicated exhibit within the national gallery to peranakan food everything here is slightly more upscale in its decor and food preparation so you will find a  hainanese chicken rice among other popular dishes priced upwards the cocktails are good too i suppose in keeping with both its upscale nature and its singaporean hospitality my crummily dressed self was seated in a far back corner behind the bar unseen by the top echelon of singapore is diners it also meant that service was slightly subpar as being in the dark corner made getting waiter attention difficult nonetheless i was in it for the food and it was fairly delicious i started with a meaty duck soup this was followed by a malaysian spicy noodle dish that was actually made with spaghetti pasta and the starter was brought last an oversized plate of turmeric chicken wings that had good flavour to them and again very sizable and meaty i would save this place for a special occasion but having preceded a visit here with a visit to the peranakan museum it seemed a suitable way to end the day,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,when in singapore you must try peranakan or nyonya cuisine what is it well it is essentially the result of melting chinese malay and indonesian cuisine into one which is pretty representative of singapore violot oon is one of singapores original celebrity chefs she is been doing this for over  years i had the chance to enjoy a meal at national kitchen during my stay in singapore and it did not disappoint the place situated on the second floor of the national art gallery national kitchen by violet oon makes you feel as if you have entered a french salon says conde nast traveler i mean just look at the place it actually reminded me of this little french restaurant in toronto called la societe the food mmmm so good for starters we had these little bundles of fried goodness called ngoh hiang  it is essentially deep fried prawns crab and chicken with water chestnut seasoned with five spice powder wrapped in bean curd skin dry laksa  i usually have the soupy laksa so this was a interesting change for me chap chye  it is a classic mixed veg dish really good but it was not anything special sambal petai with prawns  okay so this was interesting this is stinky beans fried in sambal shrimp sauce love sambal sauce but man i could not take the stinky beans please note that it was not the flavoring or how it was cooked in fact i loved the spices and the sauce i just was not a fan of the after taste that the stinky beans left tip you must try their kueh beng kah  super yummy tapioca cake toped with gula melaka syrup and coconut milk,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,located in the beautiful national gallery with a fitting design style in the dining area high tea at national kitchen is a great experience and at a very reasonable price point service was exceptional every item was explained in depth the waiter let us try three different teas all of which were world class this place has both great style and food quality recommend making reservations even if the same day,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,when in singapore have peranakan food we searched out national kitchen by violet oong after learning about the peranakan during our visit earlier to the national museum of singapore nearby hint take the guided tour we were not sure whether we could get into the national kitchen without paying for entry to the national gallery turns out we could the guard at the entrance was very helpful in showing us how to get to the restaurant on the second floor from the ground floor museum entrance the dishes were served famiy style which i love since i get a chance to try all the dishes we had a variety of dishes sambal kimchiam udang lily buds with prawns and starfruit sambal petai with prawns stinky green bean fried in spicy dried prawn sambal sauce with prawns dry med siam rice noodles with mee siam chili with prawns bean curd and chinese chivesgaram assam fishkuay pie tee famous must have the brown colored sauce is sweet the sambal is spicy all delicious when in singapore have peranakan food,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,it is a very busy place so i thought it must be good ordered baked lobster not as good as it should be when it came up it was lukewarm and a bit tough to chew full of senior citizens not sure why think i am the only tourist dumb enough to order lobsters no one else there did salads are very fresh,Negative
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,the food and drinks are quite expensive since the restuaurant is inside national gallery the environment and decoration add points,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,i came here twice during my stay in singapore the food is exquisite duh it is violet oon oh but let is talk about the decore swoon you are instantly transported to  is peranaken wealth just so charming and lovely afterwards or before be sure to explore the original courts and the beautiful art exhibits throughout the national gallery love love love the national kitchen and if i ever go back to singapore i will go back to this beautiful perfect place,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,violet oon has several restaurant locations throughout singapore this one is located in the city hall section of the national gallery it is not every day that you get to experience dining in a beautiful historic building that houses a stellar art museum it felt extravagant to go from viewing an amazing art exhibit to then dining in a lavishly opulent historic setting reservations are a must you can dine in the grand hall or on their scenic veranda the menu is focused on singaporean asian influences the service was fantastic they were very accommodating for those of us in the group with dietary restrictions the wine selection for a fancy spot was mediocre stick with the cocktails here i was with a large group and everyone enjoyed their food better than our expectations i had the house specialty the beef padang with coconut rice i could have eaten the coconut rice by itself it was phenomenal the local chicken rice was bland in comparison the beef padang paired with the coconut rice was one of my favorite dishes while in singapore note if you are low on fitbit steps just go to the bathroom a couple of times it is a trek to the restrooms located in the museum it is easy to get lost definitely ask the staff for directions they will actually walk out a bit with you and point you in the general direction until you find the signs that then lead you to the museum bathrooms in that section of the building,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,absolutely delicious peranakan food lots of flavor beautiful setting and decor great service everything i tried was delicious highly recommended,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,this was a very pleasant experience the decor reminded me of a french bistro but was completely appropriate the waiting staff were exceptional we had a variety of dishes and shared what we normally do in a chinese restaurant and even had some poisonous fruit thing fermented which made it non toxic clearly as i am writing this the next day,Negative
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,i was on yelp doing something else when i realized there were reviews for places in singapore had i but known i would have been posting for places i have visites when there in one of a ha soul of trips over the years better late than never i guess i went to violet oon with my friend who lives in pasir ris the ambiance and charm of old work singapore are definitely on display at this location within the national gallery complex it felt very high class and there were plenty of locals as well as tourists enjoying food on a sunday when we were there last february all the dishes we ordered had exquisite presentation and tasted great the pricing is probably consistent with other establishments of this caliber across the island it is no hawker center for sure it is quality food by an established name in the singaporean culinary industry and that is what you are going to pay for but you most probably wo not be disappointed if you are visiting singapore and do not know anyone local who can deconstruct the amazing mix of culinary and cultural histories i would definitely say go to a violet oon restaurant and put yourself in the hands of someone who is known far and wide for representing the food of the region just do not expect to walk in here after having visited the national gallery and get a seat make a reservation in advance you will be happy you did,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,the restaurant was located at the second floor of the museum in the city hall wing the place was decorated in blacks the place was fully booked for a friday lunch time but i managed to get a table through walk in the place was packed for lunch buah keluak ayam  classic nyonya spicy and tangy chicken stew and buah keluak nut infused with fresh root spices of lengkuas and turmericthe nut was filled with rich creamy filling which can be dig out easily by a teaspoon the chicken was tender and easily tear apart fish head curry  red snapper fish head stewed in an aromatic curry of cumin fennel chilies turmeric and onions with tomatoes baby eggplants and okrathe curry was the indian version it tasted quite spicy at first but one ate more it became quite smooth and rich in taste although the serving looked small the fish head packed lots of chunky meat in it chap chye  classic nyonya festive dish of braised mixed vegetables and bean curd skin in a rich prawn bisquethe sauce was savoury but it was lacking of the dried shrimps which was usually associated with the dish and the vegetables would be better if braised until soft the vegetables was still crunchy we have the dishes with chicken rice rice  and nasi lemak rice  which was oily and flavourful on it own,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,just delicious old world singapore i had the dry laksa noodles did not disappoint,Negative
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,my knowledge of local food and specialities is very poor but my experience there was amazing i went there alone and without booking they found me a nice seat with a beautiful view on marina bay sand hotel i ordered entry main and dessert a very tasty experience the staff was absolutely perfect very kind and friendly,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,i highly recommend the violet oon it is not only cool because it is located inside the national museum but the food and atmosphere are fabulous the tau hu goreng is a good option for a starter both the daging chabek beef cheek and the butter prawn are delicious i had the kueh beng kah for desser and it is a most try,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,the national gallery is one of my favorite buildings in singapore there is unwavering modernity in its regal architecture natural light that streams in from just about everywhere and never a touch off kilter in being something to everyone there is so much promise in a restaurant lauded as a national treasure the colonial style decor while unsurprising is tasteful and the menu looks like the perfect curation of reimagined peranakan staples and local favorites we ordered hainanese chicken rice for our  year old buah keluak noodles ngoh hiang chap chye and itek tim to share chicken rice was boring at best bland chili not spicy and a tad sweet yuck overdressed chicken and flavorless rice so uneventful that our kid who loves chicken rice spat out each mouthful and looked at the contents of her palm with curious disgust the noodles and chap chye were so overwhelming in flavor it was as if we were munching on spoonfuls of keluak essence and fermented bean paste the slices of duck breast in the soup were rubbery hinting at rookie soup prep the ngoh hiang might have been the only saving grace it was tasty and generous if not for the heart burn i am suffering from now i would hoped for so much more instead of dishes that were heinously over indexed on pleasing the tourist palate and so off colour in representing some of our nation is culinary gems i am not opposed to an occasional indulgence in a quality tourist trap i do love chatterbox and perhaps living in the vicinity of katong where some of the best peranakan food institutions operate has spoilt me rotten but i know for sure that naming this joint national kitchen is a real a misnomer i have no idea why this place gets the stunning reviews the only reason it is getting  stars is the solid service and ambience but definitely not enough to bring me back there,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,the rose is still redthe violet still oonher national kitcheni must now review wow national kitchenwhat big shoes to fill outdoing her first kitchenthus no reservation no deal love the space albeit a little small the dishes we tried we were in awe service was polite and wait much we did not am glad we ate like gluttons and felt really smitten the spices are power the ingredients fresh like flowers served hot freshly made or not if not a perfect take though not a good place for a date her food and my tongue fornicates i will be back for sure as the menu sampling has been a pleasure roses are redviolets are oon is her national kitchen is now my beau,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,uh the decor was really nice now that we have got the positives out of the way let is just say that the food was nothing special we had beef rendang chicken rice tauhu goreng satay and buah keluak noodles that were drowning in spice the main negative imo is the ambience or rather the lack of one they have simply crammed too many tables into a small space our party of seven was compressed into a booth comfortably meant for four the other upside of this acoustics are really bad and you can barely hear yourself talking it was a relief to leave if only so that i could stretch my legs out service was normal except for the waiter who kept stepping on my foot without apologizing again another problem with squeezing as many paying customers as you can into your booths i would give it two stars but i thought i would better balance out the absurdly biased poem of a review below i have had better peranakan food at malls and better ambience at nearly any other restaurant in singapore try at your own peril i will be sticking to the house of peranakan at katong or tiong bahru instead,Negative
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,curry fish head beef rendang cod fish in creamy laksa sauce idly with tomato chutney and coconut sambal kimchang udang wait a minute all these are too much for sharing between  pax especially when the curry fish head is recommended for   pax however there were simply too many items that we wished to try on the menu after a long deliberation we finally settled on the baked cod fish in creamy laksa sauce  instead of the curry fish head the portion turned out to be small roughly the size of a teenager is palm nonetheless a main cod dish costs an average of  these days and this would be quite sufficient for one pax the laksa gravy was creamy and not too spicy perfect for those who have a low spice tolerance in fact it was one of the best tasting dishes from the newly opened national kitchen by violet oon which offers a repertoire of nyonya chinese malay and indian cuisine while some said that there is finally a proper restaurant that serves the true national cuisine i felt that it is still quite early to jump to this conclusion as not all dishes are made equal the hakka abacus beads  were too chewy and there were hardly any trace of taro even though the minced meat topping was flavorful and salty i wonder if it is due to the heavy rich flavors of the other dishes we have had as the nyonya chap chye  lacked the fermented oomph in the sauce nonetheless my eyes instantly lit up when i saw the daging chabek beef cheeks  a hunky slab of meltingly tender meat with bits of fats and chewy tendon drenched in appetizing red tamarind gula melaka and coconut gravy some might prefer this indonesian peranakan twice cooked beef to be softer but the slightly sinewy texture was just right for me the first taste was sweet followed by a subtle heat that triggered a mild sensation on the tongue the gradual layerings of spices made this a far cry from the typical hot headed straightforward kind of sambal chilli would not it be great if this comes with a complimentary bowl of rice instead of charging them one unique dish that is only available at this outlet and rarely available elsewhere in singapore is the opor nangka udang  i cannot compare the young jackfruit since i have not tasted it before however i had imagined it to be creamy and rich rather than diluted stewed in salted fish and prawns in a coconut gravy the chunks of young jackfruits were short of the typical pungency of a jackfruit hence those who usually stay away from jackfruits may enjoy this dish the sauce was mildly sweet but there was not anything attractive that would anchor my love and thus it is something i would not order again we rounded off the meal with two cakes one of which is the hot seller pineapple upside down cake served warm in a pool of chilled condensed milk sauce it is not anything spectacular but still a charming diva in the world of butter cakes soft moist with finely textured crumbs just do not attempt to recall or flip through the menu for the price or you will feel the pinch when you realized it cost a hefty  the kueh beng ka  aka grated tapioca cake was a faithful rendition of the traditional nyonya sweet made extra delicious with coconut milk and gula melaka syrup the cake was silky smooth like a baked custardy kueh though it might be too smooth for those who prefer some rough gritty texture considering the price range this place is still more suited for special occasions or for foreign visitors who want to try local food in posh ambience i was impressed by the eclectic mix of vintage and southeast asian decor with old black and white photographs that draw similarities to colony the ritz carlton it made me feel as if i was dining in a wealthy peranakan mansion helmed by a matriarch however the dining experience felt cramped and stiff as the tables were positioned too closely to one another i think it might be best to come before pm even for weekdays otherwise you not only have to wait longer for the food but also have to raise your voices to speak as the place turns into a wet market when it is full house,Negative
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,went for the high tea set not by choice  for  pax with a tea or local coffee does not sound too bad until you realize that how cheap these kueh kuehs actually cost taste wise they are decent but for this price i wanted extraordinary additional  if you want dry laksa to make the meal more substantial,Negative
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,went for lunch here a couple of weeks ago our party of  arrived before noon to an almost empty restaurant but we are told that all tables were booked and we had to sit at the bar the place did fill up while we were eating but there were still a couple of empty tables by the time we left so we could have taken that anyway it was our first time here and we were impressed by the food had kueh pie tyeh beef rendang and dry laksa the taste was good and the beef rendang portion was big  small palm sized pieces of tender beef i had iced tea way overpriced at  we finished it off with coffee the decor and ambience are really nice but i find the food quite overpriced will come back and bring visitors from overseas but i do not think i will go regularly,Negative
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,the place so nice you cannot see from the street the food is great all menu is bestnoting to say only must try,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,second visit to national kitchen third overall to violet oon is restaurants still as good possibly surpassed my memory of how delicious the food is this time i tried the gado gado for starters  which was very substantial and filling for two the peanut sauce was amazing even my dining partner who is a wuss with spicy food cannot stop herself scraping the sauce up with the remaining crackers tempeh was delish beef rendang as fork tender as ever with a strong coconut based rempah very good wish i had bread to mop it all up dry laksa remains a classic we tried the buah keluak noodles this time and i found this dish the weakest candlenut does it better i remember the desserts were all sub par in my previous dining experiences so skip the pineapple upside down cake or gula melaka something and order the kueh da da pandas crepe wrap of coconut do make reservations days ahead even for weekday lunches and the restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,peranakan house rebornstepping into national kitchen is akin to stepping into another mini museum of its own or rather the realms of a peranakan house over  peranakan tiles cover some of the wall of the  sq ft restaurant located in the heart of national gallery while other corners spot old photos the titles came form old houses that have been torn down but still very much worthy as part of historic restorations ms violet oon  has been a strong advocate of the singapore taste through her cooking and writings and has set up national kitchen to advocate just that there is another outlet going by the name of violet oon singapore located in bukit timah road and we were there to celebrate the birthday for my bestie the interiorthe design of the restaurant came about with the help of a design innovation assistance grant from the design singapore council with the grant they brought the best designs in this restaurant driven by local design house black to create a homey feeling spot the little touches around you will be able to see spice pots near the entrance from documentary the restaurant is bar and takeaway boxes is green in tone to reflect ms oon is chinese name swee gek meaning jade read the rest of the review here faithjoyhope blogspot co,Positive
national-kitchen-by-violet-oon,i loved the national kitchen as soon as i walked through the doors greeted by an old world charm and an attentive friendly host we were whisked away to our reserved table rez req would in the middle of a room framed by black and white tiles gold sconce is and emerald adorned walls the wait staff was attentive and quick and the manager gave a friendly hello singapore is most signature cuisine is showcased in tasty renditions of flavorful dishes,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,this place is amazing it is bomb in nyc and it it bomb in singapore the pancakes and french toast are just soooo good place is open till  and sometimes pm breakfast till pm insane that is right there gets  stars place is small but they do a great job of placing tables for everyone they ended up giving us two tables because we ordered for five people even though there were only two of us blueberry pancakes fire my only complaint is they do not put the blueberries inside of the batter tastes so much better when inside walnut banana pancakes with a side of chocolate chips so good it is like a cookiebrioche french toast bomb great flavor nicely cooked egg white omelette with goat cheese mushroom spinach delicious nyc to singapore place is a staple,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,so long as clinton street baking company continues to dish up the best pancakes i have ever had in my life be they in new york city tokyo or singapore i will continue to give them five stars star  how were the service and atmosphere this clinton street is a cute little one comparable to their tokyo location and while it lacked the natural light conducive to food photography i know i know i am sorry for even pointing that out the service was fast and friendly star star  how were the portions relative to the cost   for brioche french toast was pricey but very much on par with other spots catering to tourists and expats like clinton street and common man star stars  and  how was the food clinton street continues to dish up the best pancakes in the world seriously i do not know how they do it and especially how they maintain consistency internationally but these fluffy cakes of goodness are so flavorful and go so well with the blueberries and maple butter syrup that it is just impossible to compete two stars star  would you be excited to go back always star,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i wanted to go here for the past two days for breakfast but it was so crowded today i waited until the afternoon and had a late late breakfast i got the banana walnut pancakes and they were delicious looking around all the food that people ordered looked good,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,definitely on the pricey side but that is to be expected of most of the restaurants in the downtown area i went for breakfast and the food was amazing with a variety of american style options to choose from i shared the chocolate chip pancakes and a scrambled eggs dish and both were fantastic the pancakes were fluffy and the chocolate chips were a perfect complement it was such a sweet rich dish and i wish i had gotten a larger share i split between  people though so that should not have been a surprise the eggs were delicious and the biscuit that came with it was amazing so buttery and satisfying i would definitely recommend getting a few things to split because then you can try multiple offerings next time i am in singapore i will definitely come back,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,the pancakes are insane went here for breakfast and we ordered heuvos ranchis and the salmon omelette both were ok but nothing special next we ordered the chocolate chip pancakes i believe they are one of the best pancakes i have ever tasted they are hot fluffy and the chocolate chip are melted inside them plus the pancakes are hot such that the chocolate chip sprinkled above them can easily melt other than the perfect pancakes the maple syrup that comes with it is also perfect it is not your average maple syrup,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i am not a huge fan of pancakes and that is not because i do not enjoy them i do i really do it is just that not everyone perfects them my husband and i were in singapore for a couple of days and we both like our meals to be delicious so my husband found this place mostly because they have good pancakes based on the reviews he read and we decided to give it a try we both ordered our pancakes with chocolate chunks when the waiter brought the pancakes to our table they looked like regular pancakes however the moment i drizzled the buttered maple syrup on top of the fluffy round edges of my pancake i immediately knew that this one is going to be one of the best i ever had and i was right the buttered maple syrup was so darn good to the point that without it the pancake would not taste this incredible my husband loved it and so did i glad we gave it a try now i think you should,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,outstanding pancakes the portion sizes are a little intimidating so if you do not tend to eat much i would recommend sharing one dish with a friend i had the blueberry pancakes as well as a mocha the mocha was good but the pancakes were where they shined,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,good american style food large portions good coffee and tea recommended pancakes are huge and tasty bacon is crunchy and very nice,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,favorite brunch place in town always bustling atmosphere whenever we drop by expect a waiting list during weekends chicken waffle is definitely a must try we have tried the huevos rancheros sugar bacon burger as well which really are not bad at all overall everything in this place are cooked tastes well,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,great american styled brunch option the biscuit was perfect the portions were big would definitely go back if visiting the country again,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,best fluffy pancakes in singapore love the sausage patties huevos rancheros is my go to dish the only item i would say does not tickle my fancy is the sugared bacon i like my bacon unsweetened will try to order that next visit,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,this is a great place to get breakfast all day long i ordered the pancakes with bananas and walnuts and was not disappointed the syrup is rich and flavorful the nuts are candies and the bananas are lightly dusted with sugar it does not look like a lot but it was very filling the restaurant is not very big so get here early or plan to wait for a table the prices are average for the area i will definitely return the next time i am in singapore,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,clean and nice interior friendly staff however the food was not up to expectations the fried chicken waffle was horrible does not taste like good fried chicken and waffle was not crispy but soft the pancakes with blueberries were ok pretty thick pieces,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,if you are looking for a typical american diner style breakfast clinton is is definitely the place for you the portions were more than generous though still not as massive as the portions in the states the food quality was pretty good as well i had the farmer is platter or breakfast cannot remember the exact title now and i loved how well the eggs were done slightly runny just to my liking everything was a little sweet as if coated with maple syrup but i think it blended well together i would definitely get the pancakes the next time i visit this place the nutella one looked awesome just to throw some caution they are pretty strict on reservations also they only can confirm a reservation of up to  pax any more they cannot confirm have to walk in,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,by far the best western style breakfast brunch i have ever had in singapore i highly recommend the blueberry pancakes and the hash brown came in a party of  noting the portions of the people around we ordered a blueberry pancake a hash brown and a two eggs any style which we chose scrambled the blueberry pancakes extremely fluffy not at all dry with a fragrance that reminds me of nice waffles which on its own is already worth a   comes with the blueberry sauce which unlike typical jam type of sauce is not too sweet but somewhat tart very refreshing also comes with a small cup of maple butter oh the brilliance saves you the trouble of spreading the butter an extremely cumbersome process the maple butter is not too sweet with a flavour that is surprisingly not too heavy somewhat reminiscent of caramel and has a nice amber fragrance to it these  items eaten together is heavenly so overall a   for this dish without a shadow of doubt portion to us is too large for  person maybe closer to   persons for typical singaporean breakfast portioning the scrambled eggs well done nice butter fragrance nothing spectacular compared to the other  dishes   the has brown oh the hash brown drenched in buttery goodness with a mix of smooth mashed potatoes chunky potatoes and some portions that are fried crispy plain simple goodness made to perfection this to me overtakes the well done rosti at marche as the best rendition of a potato dish   all in all i am impressed i am not even sure why some people complain about the prices it appears expensive yes but that reflects the portion they are serving bring friends along to share and the prices are extremely reasonable coupled with the brilliant quality this is a no brainer never had a western style breakfast that truly impressed me in singapore this is the first,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,the service was great and the atmosphere was too i ordered the blueberry pancakes and the veggie sandwich the veggie sandwich was good it was packed with avocados which is a plus but it is a little bit pricy the pancakes is however tasted incredible along with the warm maple butter and the blueberries on top of it   would recommend y all to come here just to get a taste of the pancakes,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,tried the much lauded fried chicken today the chicken and waffles and chicken plate did not like the way the chicken was prepared for the waffles boneless fillets with a thin batter as it was rather dry chicken plate was very generous with literally half a chicken on the plate along with a decent chunk of corn bread and small token coleslaw the batter on the chicken plate was better buttermilk and had a good crunch unfortunately it was either bad old oil or the oil was too hot but ultimately had a burnt and slightly acrid flavour the flavour and seasoning was not great either so i found it rather plain overall i would go back for a shake or some of the desserts and maybe give the pancakes another shot all the other tables food looked well prepared and equally generous so value for money is decent by singapore standards for these sort of establishments service was clinical and efficient without being particularly friendly venue itself was quite cramped with tables extremely close to each other i went to the original store in nyc and was not that impressed by it either thankfully the ludicrous hype has died down and we got a table with no issues on a sunday at pm,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,did not have to queue on a weekday afternoon blueberry pancakes  starsgood fluffy standard fare nothing spectacular imo i would have preferred plain maple syrup to the maple butter and would have liked more blueberries on top but there was a decent number of blueberries in the pancakes themselves spanish scramble  starsan omelette with chorizo and caramelized onions well done the brunch dishes taste better than those over at wild honey though wild honey is more conveniently located i would pick this one if i were picking based on food alone update  apr black angus cheeseburger    stars    stars for the price i like my math apparently everything on the burger the caramelized onions the cheese was good and the meat itself was juicy but bland i got it medium and it was still kinda red and oozed the fries were mediocre salty and crispy but again the taste was not great the slaw was alright i appreciated the pickle overall okay wifi only for phones they wo not type it in for your tablet or laptop  stars for the ambience nice bright and roomy,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,back again on a saturday night for dinner and this time we had the angus cheeseburger chicken and waffle clinton st omelette and buttermilk biscuit sandwich oh and of course the blueberry pancakes friends loved the food particularly the blueberry pancakes and the buttermilk biscuit sandwich i had the chicken and waffle i would prefer if the chicken was more deep fried and crispy though the waffle was tasty with the maple butter the angus cheeseburger looked delightful and we particularly enjoyed the very tasty fries portions were satisfying and we barely had space for desserts could only make room for  pancakes amongst a party of  the bill was about  per person i had made reservations by phone which was painless though i wish they have an online option it is interesting that is not available considering the reservation confirmation was done via an automated system we will be back again to try more of their desserts,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,this was easily the worst experience we had anywhere on our entire trip left waiting for  minutes to place our order while the table next to us seated after we arrived placed and received their order we were generally ignored by the staff and at the end we paid  extra for their service do yourself a favor and go elsewhere,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i came here because the hotel breakfast at the intercontinental was s a pop and i thought i could do better or at least the same for less so i decided to go to killiney kopitiam but my ang moh instincts took over while passing the lower rated clinton street baking co they had muffins on display and i am partial to western breakfasts so i was sucked in the first thing i saw from the menu was it was not going to be much less expensive so maybe it will be great same for more i ordered what i thought was their signature omelette because it had their name on it but it only comes with two add in ingredients besides the eggs of course and apparently nothing but those two plus the eggs because when the omelette arrived i was asked if i wanted salt pepper or catsup the first sign of cooking mediocrity is the need to season it with any of those things after cooking especially a  omelette if i would known i would have chosen bacon to go in there ugh it was so bland and dry i regretted not asking for catsup i regretted more not having salsa which is the best cure for bland eggs the hash browns though were remarkable if it was a two egg omelette instead of a three egger i was pushing through i would have savored them more my cappuccino was also well done final tally s at the hotel i could have bottomless juice cappuccinos an array of japanese chinese indian and western breakfast items smoked salmon with capers fresh made waffles croissants and danishes fresh fruit i got less for more i am kind of amazed they did not have oatmeal or porridge on the menu my punishment for not going to the kopitiam,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,has the typical american bistro surroundings so for those that miss home this is where you should be going to food is consistent every visit and on the weekdays at around  pm we could instantly get seats for two drinks are really expensive and personally i think water would suffice as the dishes are rather savory portions are good old american portions so for small eaters please do share with your pal had the southern breakfast today bacon was drenched in honey cheese grits are perfectly on point fried zucchini and poached eggs complemented well on the whole average cafe food but decent within the mile radius kids friendly selfie friendly as place is well lit with sufficient lighting,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,located in the middle of purvis street is this cafe called clinton street baking company its main outlet is in new york united states it is well known for its pancake and is known as new york is  breakfast spot by lonely planet as well as best pancakes by new york magazine twice the place was decorated in a traditional clean cut look the usual menu was presented in a booklet besides the usual menu there is daily special items on the board as well as dinner special items boozy salted caramel  left vanilla ice cream bourbon salted caramel saucewithout alcohol  right pretty strong in the alcohol the drink tasted very rich and creamy but could not taste the salted caramel in it crab cakes  two crab cakes served with classic remoulade and house slaw the crab cake was moist and creamy inside with chunks of crab meat in it chicken waffles  with honey tabasco sauce a crispy belgian vanilla buttermilk waffle and signature warm maple butter the chicken was served char burnt which made one quite disappointed some parts of the batter was just too hard and bitter to be eaten one had to remove the batter coating in order to eat although the staff saw that we had left much of the batter untouch when clearing the plates no one asked us about the food the waffle was not the usual crispy and fluffy type instead it was eggy and soft more like kueh kueh type not bad with the maple butter sauce but not really my type pancakes with warm maple butter  served with wild blueberries the first which i notice when the dish was served was that the pancakes were super thick in size the pancake was fluffy and soft with a kind of eggy taste some may felt that the blueberries was a bit too sour nice but could not take in more a piece of pancake it was way too much for me overall felt that the food was overrated maybe i was expecting too much but it just did not blow me off although the place looked sparkling clean i was surprised to see a certain small animal running through the dining area no wonder the place had placed a notice that it would be closed early for maintenance on the coming monday i soon lost my appetite after that and trying to vomit everything out,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,finally a good american diner style breakfast place in singapore the food here is pretty good i have tried the pancakes with warm maple butter banana walnut as well as chicken and waffles both were really good the pancakes were extremely fluffy and are in my opinion one of the best you can find in here and the warm maple butter they are served with was also heavenly,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,to summarize it all in a word pancakes eat the pancakes clinton st baking co of manhattan is lower east side finally lands in singapore with a huge splash with glowing reviews in the island is english language broadsheet and features on tv stepping inside the dining room successfully recreates that typical american diner feel similar to the original in ny but definitely much newer the entrees were decently good but i would recommend the pancakes above everything else fluffy on the inside crispy on the outside paired with a sinful maple butter sauce that is just amazing as it is calorific blueberry banana walnut or chocolate chunk they are all good the house brew is drip coffee and refills are free they had a couple of southern offerings on the menu but imo they were northern interpretations of southern food i liked that the buttermilk fried chicken had cornmeal in the batter however the batter lost its crunchiness rather quickly and fell off the chicken before you had a chance to bite it conclusion stick to the pancakes they do not take reservations and weekend brunch lines are an hour wait or more to avoid the crowds i recommend coming in on a weekday or late in the afternoon on a weekend or heading for the pastry coffee takeout counter instead it is been a while since i was back in manhattan and i personally have not been to the original on clinton st there i heard the lines are an hour long too but comparing this to other brunch type places in singapore they pretty much come out tops  if this is a place in the us  cos it is in singapore,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,this morning we had breakfast here overall quality of foods was good but not exceptionally good but the serving was generous service quite good too we asked the leftovers to be put in the box and they did it nicely a bit pricey too,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,similar to the ny original which i find overpriced and overhyped except this place did not have any queue on saturday at pm i just walked right in amazing serves your standard easy to make at home but why bother lets just pay lots of money american brunch fare chicken and waffles their famous blueberry pancakes milkshakes you know all that healthy stuff that keeps americans so notoriously thin,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i recently had a pancake craving and with all the hype surrounding this place i just had to check it out for myself popped in here on a weekday late afternoon and there was no queue the place had about  people so you may want to try your luck instead of the horrendous weekend queues there are some benches outside if you should so feel inclined to wait with the crowds the bellini flavors are seasonal here and on that day it happened to be strawberry yum prosecco and fruit cannot go wrong i got the banana walnut pancakes and oh my were they delicious the pancakes came topped with fresh banana and crunchy walnuts and some sugar sprinkled for extra crunch crisp exterior with a fluffy interior with more banana and walnuts within coupled with their gorgeous maple syrup butter sauce one vessel of sauce is not enough for  large pancakes so i got another it cost me  but oh well i did not come to clinton st baking co to be a stingy person a friend told me you can change the flavor of one of the pancakes for an extra  if i am not wrong i also got the cheese grits and ye it tastes like a savory oatmeal with cheese very regular service was prompt but i guess a true test of the waitstaff is peak hours which i obviously did not get to see would return for the pancakes or maybe to try the chicken and waffles p s amex not accepted here,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,this is my nd visit i love the pancake and also the chicken and waffle the maple butterscotch syrup is a bomb supper yummy but can be too sweet for some people so advice do not pour it a one go portion can be huge if you do not have a big appetite can be crowed during weekend and dinner time so advice to make your reservation in advance if you planing dinner or weekend brunch here tips you can make reservation via chope app,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i had this a few years ago in new york unfortunately it was after a visit to katz and if you have seen the size of their pastrami sandwiches you would know how stuffed i was at that time so all i had was the bacon and it did not leave much of an impression then fast forward to  years later and clinton street baking co is now in sunny hazy singapore they do not take reservations and we were here on a sunday morning and the queue was   hours by the time it was our turn to be seated it was  hours be warned that the queue is deceptively short because everyone just gives their handphone number and goes away while waiting there are some red benches to sit on outside the shop but it could fit a maximum of  people  yummy mummy types tried to cut the queue why do not we tell them that we have a baby to which i said is the baby going to be eating the food here my question was answered when i made the mistake of ordering the cheese grits a mush in a plate it tasted as good as it looked which was not at all i would rather some mashed potatoes even the powdered ones that you get from   other sides were good but not impressive we had the southern chicken skin was yums the scrambled eggs with salmon not baaaaad and some farmer is platter like good but i would not wait more than  minutes for them but the standout were the pancakes  flavors blueberry banana chocolate to choose from you can add  more flavour for  same pancakes different toppings these were nice and fluffy and thick yet light i think the only other place in singapore that comes close so far is skyve if you put the pancakes from those  places together and made me choose  i do not know which would win but maybe clinton street because of that wonderful maple syrup butter mix which married the taste of maple syrup with the smoothness of melted butter come here unless you are a yummy mummy with a baby trying to cut the queue,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,my first time here ever did not know about the new york branch so there is no basis for comparison i have heard lots of excited rumblings of course and friends who used to live in new york were thrilled about its opening fair enough from all accounts i hear that this place largely works the food is comparable and all i will have to take their word for it i only came here for some cake and i got the upside down pineapple cake i do not know why but seeing a badly sliced and sloppily presented cake annoyed me it shows a lack of care in the attentive level of staff when i went to pay i noticed that other cakes of other flavors were similarly badly sliced woah i really did think clinton st bakery was better than this taste wise the cake was fine not great not terrible the staff was sufficiently polite but i think the devil is in the details and they need to teach their staff how to slice cakes properly lift the slices and place them on plates,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,we had the farmers plate and the butter milk biscuit sandwich on both dishes the scrambled eggs were done perfectly the buttermilk biscuit sandwich was tasty the biscuit crunchy on the outside and buttery inside bacon was tasty the farmers plate was a healthy amount of food pork patties were flavorful and had just a slight kick sourdough bread was a little skimpy coffee was good especially if you are tired of the local the restaurant is pleasant sunny with great staff prices are on the high side we spent nearly  for breakfast,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,a great spot for a classic american breakfast we had blueberry pancakes french toast and the farmer is breakfast all were excellent and the portions are massive you certainly wo not go hungry if you go on the weekend i would get there when it opens if you do not want to wait there were  of us waiting by the time it opened i will definitely be back to sample some of their non breakfast items at some point the service was a bit slow i think the young staff are a bit overwhelmed hopefully that will improve with time,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,chicken and waffle without the sauce the waffle is too sweet for me the chicken is boneless and has an nice crisp somehow it does not sit well with me it is alright not wow satiates a craving,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,everything should be half the price for the same price you can get three times the quality at p s cafe dishes with eggs were underseasoned and in lack of flavor the  dollar omelet has an egg to stuffing ratio of   not coming back coffee was good,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,given that it is a fairly well known brand from nyc lines and crowds are expected even in the soft launch phase approx  hour wait during weekend brunch order came pretty swiftly had the classic pancakes generous portions as per the ones in nyc chicken and waffles were decent but not mind blowing overall decent cool brunch spot hopefully it survived beyond the hype,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,what makes this brunch spot unique is their homemade maple syrup which tastes different than anything i have ever tasted in singapore and in the u s the maple syrup is light and sweet with a tang of caramel and an excellent addition to the crispy pancakes or waffles i will admit it is not the most balanced or nutritious meal however and do feel a bit guilty and gluttonous after having had brunch there once the wait can be long but i would still say it was worth it would go back once in a while,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,massive portions we have tried the blueberry pancakes and we had to take half away as it was so big it was delicious too the restaurant was super busy and it was almost  totally recommend for a late breakfast,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,great breakfast food busy yet nice atmosphere and mediocre service went on a saturday afternoon for a late lunch and they were still very busy sat at the counter and ate which gave me a front row seat to the controlled chaos of servers flying around picking up orders and ringing up customers the service could have been better no one spoke to me after i ordered to check on the food or pour more coffee and i had to ask for the check had the chicken and waffles which was quite good especially with their green jalapeo based hot sauce add the maple butter and you are good to go i agree with another review that the waffle could have been a little more well done especially to support the fried chicken but still worth getting will definitely be back for those pancakes,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,if you are after a substantial american style breakfast or brunch clinton street baking co is a decent option the servings are massive just like in the states but the prices reflect the portion size they have a lot of the classics here pancakes eggs on toast a big breakfast etc i thought they might have more baked goods on offer in the display cabinet given the business name but there were just a few scones and muffins i opted for the smoked salmon scrambled eggs and was not disappointed,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,delicious breakfast good menu options in a nice little neighbourhood staff all very friendly and attentive,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,wow very impressive food we try once and tomorrow will be our second time i thinking to go there once a month at least,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,you know it is good when there is queue outside indulgent perfect for those on vacation and want to splurge for those who have a moment of i worked hard all year i deserve this,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i am from nyc and have been dying to go to this place so i was extremely surprised when i saw it pop up on yelp while searching for breakfast when we first arrived we were told it would be a  minute wait but then was seated promptly we ordered chicken and waffles banana walnut pancakes and the biscuit egg sandwich being from ny i was definitely shocked by how good the food was here in singapore the eggs on the biscuit sandwich was cooked perfectly the only thing i did not like was the tomato sauce on the biscuit sandwich i wish this sandwich was a little bigger though the potatoes that came with the sandwich were also delicious the pancakes were light and fluffy and just the right portion the chicken and waffles was also another fantastic dish with the chicken being nice and crispy i will say the service was subpar no one came over to ask how our meal was nor did they clear our plates or deliver the check at a reasonable time we had to ask a different waiter for it overall four stars and i cannot wait to now try the ny location,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,having been to their original location in les multiple times i was very impressed with the pancakes at their new establishment in singapore let is be honest here most of the restaurants that have opened up branches in singapore are disappointments compared to their original location overseas e g lady m din tai fung tim ho wan lawrys etc we came for lunch on a weekday around   so there was no wait my pancakes were fluffy and moist and my friend is country breakfast also looked delicious my only complaint is with the service which was rather slow we had to flag down the server a couple times to order our food even though the restaurant was only half full will def be back again soon,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,very disappointed in this place over priced for such mediocre food eggs were over cooked sausage patties and the piece of ham were not very flavorful i also personally did not like the strong flavor of the cheese coffee was not that great either all in all not worth the price mediocre food for high end price,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,highly recommend for a great brunch best breakfast biscuit sandwich i have ever had pancakes are typical i felt i lived in nyc for  years and remember my times at clinton street baking company out there very fondly i loved everything there even their pancakes had a very impactful memory that i became jaded to any other pancake coming here however i feel that the pancakes are nowhere near the quality in nyc and even taste pretty typical to any other cafe which is the the only reason for the minus  star given how hyped they are the biscuit breakfast sandwich is the best i have ever had in my life i was totally wow would by this here in singapore and if my review was based on only this i would have easily given this a resounding  star orange juice is fresh as is their coffee i would recommend that you call ahead and get a reservation if you show up during the breakfast or lunch or weekend brunch hours you will for sure need to wait the usual   hours that they mention highly recommend but do not come in just for the pancakes,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,this outpost of clinton st does not hold up the reputation or quality of the original in nyc where i would queue for  minutes in a blizzard for that alpha dog eggs benedict not here though i will give it another try but the taste is way off hopefully they have ironed out the kinks,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,loved the thick fluffy pancakes and maple butter do share the food if you are a small eater waitresses were so polite loved their service we waited for a few minutes to be served as it was quite packed on a sunday morning poached eggs were a tad disappointing as they did not drain the water so the eggs were sitting in a pool of water if you are the type who does not like sweet tasting mocha then this is the place but it was a tad watery to my liking overall enjoyed the place would not mind heading there again to try the other food,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,had the rosti with smoked salmon i find it too crispy for my liking but it was not that bad the blueberry pancakes were not bad service was pretty okay i thought the design of the place was quite cool it had a american diner vibe with ample seating,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,get your carbs on brunch lovers and carb lovers this is your spot yes the wait can be a little crazy but if you are patient you will be rewarded with some fab soul hugging muffin top making food just spend an extra  minutes on the elliptical the trick is to go early before  am and the wait is manageable they are only open until  pm now but that may change soon the foodwe could not help but indulge in a few pastries the bacon spinach cheddar muffin was savory a little sweet and indulgent even my baby loved it well for obvious reasons the cheddar scone was crumbly and had a wonderful buttery top but the real star is the crab cake eggs benedict it was the best eggs benedict i have ever eaten each component from the just cooked spinach to the creamy hollandaise sauce to the rich crab cake was just plain delicious i also had the chorizo with eggs and it was savory and satisfying we were very happy with the food so far and this is one of my new favorite brunch spots,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,a pretty basic place came here because i was craving pancakes they were pretty good i enjoyed the blueberries and the sauce with the pancakes which i felt were a good combination i wished they gave more blueberries because towards the end it started to get pretty dry the sauce also started to get too sweet once the blueberries finished but the pancakes were fluffy and tasty the chicken and waffles were a disappointment i admit the waffles were done differently and could be subjectively just not up to my taste but the chicken was poor tasteless kinda soggy and dry the sweet sauce did not really go well with this and overall i am really not a fan of this dish ordered the grits as well which was horrible could tell they did not know how to cook cheese grits and it is not like what it is meant to be like very dry and undercooked flavourless bah horrible the sausage patty was just minced meat smashed fried not what you would expect disappointing because on the menu it said sausage maple,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,we went here for breakfast and we are not really impressed they got one of our orders wrong completely forgot another and had zero apologies for it all food is really mediocre for the price all the egg dishes were well prepared but everything else on the plate was unappetizing the biscuits were dry the ham was leathery the bread was stale would not recommend at all,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,great breakfast i had the huevos rancheros pleasantly surprised to find a mexican classic in singapore our table shared the special pancakes of the month with rum coconut and bananas which were absolutely divine,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,being a fan of the pancakes and southern breakfast of the original clinton st baking company in nyc we excitedly arranged to meet at this place for brunch to reminisce our old nyc days recommendation just stick to the fried chicken and pancakes they were tasty and definitely of similar standards to the dishes we had in nyc however what really disappointed us was their cheesy grits it looked and tasted like oatmeal porridge and when we tried to tell them that was not definitely not grit they checked and confirmed it was grit made from barley and they followed the original recipe com on if it is not grit do not insist it is and bullshit us like we are some ignorant customers i would have accepted a yes sorry it is not easy to find grits and this is what we have used to replace it google grit and it is grits is a food made from corn that is ground into a coarse meal and then boiled suggestion to the chef even polenta has a more similar taste and texture to real grits than whatever you are serving now next is the corn bread which has a ginseng taste to it it happens that my friend liked ginseng and hence liked it otherwise i would not recommend you order that either spinach was cooked like chinese style and a bit bland all in all nice environment but not sure i will be back for the food,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i cannot think of a better place to have pies waffles or pancakes in singapore the diner style atmosphere is casual and relaxed a great place to bring kids and family to during weekends,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,definitely order the chicken and waffles staff recommended to order onion rings as sides do not order onion rings completely disappointing we came on a monday afternoon not too busy just some tables of ladies of leisure but be aware your last order is at pm,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,this place was soooooo delicious we came here on our first day in singapore for breakfast and ended up coming back on our last day because of how good it was the waffles were amazing and the orange juice really was freshly squeezed the place is very clean inside and the workers were patient helpful and friendly   recommend,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i missed checking this place out in new york so i was really happy to find that it is now in singapore there was not an savory sweet combo for pancakes so i ordered a wild blueberry pancake and added bacon the pancakes were sooooo fluffy and when paired with the sour ish berries and sweet syrup it was great the bacon was too hard for my liking be ready to spend a bit the pancake with a side of bacon coffee and juice came up to,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,if you want an excellent american style breakfast this is the spot cool clean brightly lit bakery serves a broad breakfast menu all day lunch menu served from  am until pm a good selection of bakery treats are available all day,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,amazing place worth the wait coffee is great do not get us started with the pancakes renowned for its crisp definitely worth a try,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i had spinach egg for breakfast it tasted absolutely bland tasteless the portion of the orange juice is way too little not worth the price it is not the breakfast to die as compared in states lastly customer service was bad coffee is good tho,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,breakfast was mediocre nothing crazy or wow about overpriced as well would i recommend sure if there is nothing else on the block to eat otherwise it is not worth a visit,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,that moment when you are in an entirely different country and you see they have your favorite nyc breakfast spot is in singapore but it is no where near as good and your charged double the price very disappointing,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,the good the bad and the bourbon salted caramel milkshakei preface this by saying i absolutely love clinton street baking co in new york the singapore shop matches the new york venue in some respects main courses and drinks and fails in other areas pies and service i will start with the good for a shop known for its baked goods and pancakes the drinks were fantastic the bourbon salted caramel milkshake was the best thing we had and the bloody mary which is so rarely made well was also delicious the main courses we tried pancakes and huevos rancheros were every bit as good as the ny shop unfortunately there were several areas where clinton street really struggled first the service was horrible after we were seated not one staff member came to our table without being asked we had to ask for drinks for menus to order to get a dessert menu to get a check and to have our check taken and processed when there were quality issues with food see below we did not get an apology and the waiter seemed annoyed to have to deal with the issue second when we arrived for brunch two of the three pies of the day were unavailable no explanation was give nor was any apology forthcoming we tried the only special available strawberry rhubarb pie and the lime meringue pie both were disappointing the crumble on the strawberry rhubarb pie was like a group of small indestructible rocks we could not break up the cm pieces with a fork and we tried we were not provided a knife with dessert the lime meringue pie tasted good but there was so little lime custard except at the very edge of the pie that it tasted almost exclusively of meringue when i pointed these out to our server he simply asked if we would like something different i pointed out that there was very little else available as two of the pies of the day were not available and he stood in silence he did not seem to have any idea how the pies should be made or the quality that is normally associated with clinton street,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i had heard about this place from a few people i tasked myself for bringing a pumpkin pie for a thanksgiving get together i wanted a back up i called the week before and they mentioned that the seasonal pies pumpkin and pecan were  nope i ended up baking one but still wanted another desert so i decided to pop by on sunday because i wanted breakfast and needed a back up dessert i ordered the breakfast sandwich that came with spinach bacon egg and cheese on a biscuit now this place is supposedly by the same company as the one in ny so my expectations were high i am from the south so you better bring your a game when it comes to biscuits i ordered and my food came out before my latte it looked awful and for  i was not happy the cheese looked like it was under a heat lamp for the last hour the hashbrowns were burnt and the one side of the biscuit had what looked like a tomato sauce on it wtf the bacon was so sad and undercooked i just could not touch it i ate a tiny piece of the biscuit and drank my latte the waitress was nice enough to ask me what was wrong in which i told her it looked like my meal came from when bush was president and asked if i wanted a replacement the pancakes looked really good but by this time i needed to get outta there i did order a strawberry rubarb pie to take with and they took off my breakfast off my bill they also game me a large take away biscuit for good measure which by itself was really tasty everyone at thanksgiving liked the pie i did not taste it i doubt i would come back here there are just too many good options for brunch in singapore to strike out again,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,great food but while eating my breakfast they have decided it is a great time to fix the door hinge to the entrance which consists of some ass hat pounding and tapping on it during my entire meal clueless and ruined my experience would have been awesome other than that,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,went for the chicken and waffles they were amazing the batter on the chicken was light and not greasy we loved the flavoring of the chicken batter and it was moist chicken breast we tried the fried chicken four pieces of chicken which were moist and yummy great flavoring in the batter the jalapeo cornbread was quite large and yummy we got a blueberry shake unfortunately it was not worth the price but everything else was yummy this was my second time and this time the service was awful luckily the food is so yummy i had taken friends and they were very disappointed in the service it was early in the evening a bit after pm and not very busy so i have no idea why the service refills order taken food coming out at different times was slow still would go back because the food was yummy,Negative
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,i had a delicious salmon latkes plate with caviar and aioli it was really rich i also ordered toast that was slightly disappointing but the latkes more than made up for it,Positive
clinton-street-baking-company-and-restaurant,it is so difficult to find the american diner experience in asia but clinton street baking company captures the taste which brings quite a bit of nostalgia living in the us for anyone missing diner food this is a must try my only complaint is that they need more waiters as   people is grossly insufficient to manage a restaurant if that size,Positive
colony,absolutely loved dining at colony i was warmly greeted and shown to my table and on the way set my eyes on the beautiful buffet the restaurant itself is tastefully designed and the lay out of the buffet flows nicely the selection is wonderful and clearly makes sure to incorporate local dishes naturally i sampled as much as i could and was pleasantly surprised to have found everything to be delicious from experience often not the case in buffet style dining the steamed salted egg bun specifically was phenomenal and is a must try every individual i encountered working at colony was exceedingly friendly and one of the chefs even posed the steamer baskets so that i could take a nice photo with the salted egg buns i will be visiting again on my next trip to singapore,Positive
colony,another day another lunch my girlfriend and i made plans to come here for a buffet lunch she was the one in charge of making reservation after all her dear friend was still fighting some jet lag demon which never want to go away she texted me and highlighted about the dress code lol i assured her there were no tees or shorts in my suitcase and flip flops i know better and she should know that p so everyone note there is a dress code at the colony and i hope everyone stick to that dress code not only out of respect for the restaurant but also out of respect for your fellow patrons as well i arrived  mins before noon the staffs were busy prepping for the lunch that starts at noon my girlfriend showed up and we just waited around the entrance and soon one staff came and checked us in i supposed one should definitely not try to walk in in order to dine here by this time the restaurant started to fill up with a lot of people who were all here for the buffet it was a far cry from  minutes ago when it was so calm and quiet ambience  i really like the ambience i like the natural light flowing in from outside and how bright the whole place is then what went wrong  there were some tiny fruit flies at the restaurant one was drinking the water condensation on one of our glasses but not before i ended it and my friend i each have taken the lives of one of those insects on our table  this is probably not the fault of the restaurant but i was not thrilled when there were so many noisy and unruly kids at the restaurant they were goofing around their table and i was so worried my bowl of piping hot noodles would end up on their heads trying to make my way back to my table with a plate of hot food while trying not to get bumped into by these kids i did not need that kind of stress to all those who like to dine at the colony and planned to bring your kid s if your kid s cannot behave and you cannot control your kid s please for the love of god do not bring them there food  the buffet was divided into many sections there was the chinese japanese local cold cuts seafood indian juices drink stand etc i have to say the colony did not fare well on the chinese food section just to point out a few  char siew pau bbq pork bun non fluffy and the filling was so dry shrimp dumpling filling was not tasty the skin though soft was funky chicken siew mai chicken dumpling not tasty bbq pork ribs looked absolutely delicious but they were so tough i made better ribs enough said there were a few things which i absolutely love or like  beef not sure what it was called so soft and  yummy  golden pineapple rice not bad at all herbal chicken soup wonderful blueberry iced tea think i had like   glasses so refreshing what could be better  the chinese food section of course cook those ribs longer please  pastries they were alright but i expect better service  staff was attentive and our water was constantly refilled plates were removed very promptly new cutlery was given every time we were done with our food i was absolutely happy with that most restaurants let one reused their cutlery i hate putting used fork and knife on the table however one question why did many other tables were served with coffee or tea no one came to ask us if we like to have coffee or tea hmmm,Negative
colony,this buffet was worth every dollar spent my wife and i celebrated our  year anniversary and part of our honeymoon at colony and it was everything i read about it and more buffets are typically unattractive gorge fest atmospheres filled with gluttony and sloppiness everywhere but colony puts a whole new spin on it the restaurant puts other buffets to shame adding a major touch of classiness and romanticism to it all the restaurant is located in the ritz carlton hotel and can easily be found in the lobby customers are first greeted by the patisserie section with its delectable collection of pastries and desserts before making their way onto the dining area after a quick glance one might even want to skip straight to dessert that is until they lay their eyes on one of the other  sections of the buffet besides the patisserie there is the following sections which are all connected to one another ice bar jumbo shrimp cocktail snow crab legs raw oysters mussels craw fish sashimi sushi etc grill rotisserie grilled ham brussels sprouts mashed potatoes sausage squash kale etc steam basket steamed dim sum buns ready to made hot pot food fish balls noodles etc wok chinese malay cuisine such as steamed fish chili crab fried rice prawns ribs vermicelli etc tandoor indian cuisine such as various curries basmati rice etc fruit stall juices and whole fruitsi probably did not come close to naming every single food that was served in each section but it should give any hungry person an idea prior to walking in i cannot fit a comment here on every single item but to summarize the seafood was extremely fresh the sushi was great for a buffet the hot foods from the chinese malay indian cuisine sections were very tasty we did not find a single thing wrong with anything we ate by far the most attractive section though was the patisserie the assortment of pastries and little desserts here and there were fantastic and any dessert lover is dream it really gave us the opportunity to sample away because they were small enough yes the buffet is  per adult for dinners and it is totally worth it with the amazing selection and chill atmosphere buffets are not typically thought of as date restaurants but colony really redefines what a buffet is on top of it all our waiter was excellent he knew we were here for our honeymoon and even gave us a quick tour of the buffet when we arrived so we would not get lost the perfect buffet if it is not it is damn close to it,Positive
colony,my favorite champagne brunch spot in singapore it use to be called the greenhouse the same space was renamed colony but the all you can drink and eat decadent buffet is pretty much the same as expected of a champagne brunch in singapore it has a full raw bar plenty of charcuterie a nice cheese selections some dim sum pasta and noodle stations a roast of some sort breakfast items soups salad bar and a variety of desserts you can eat for days but you only have a few hours to gobble down all this goodness nevermind the free flow vintaged brut or rose champagne and bloody marys champagne brunch in singapore is not a meal it is an event so bring an empty stomach and some great friends and prepare to have an amazing time getting stuffed on food and drink,Positive
colony,it is a promising buffet but like buffets food in general is good but never excellent they do offer a good variety of food noodle stand dim sum chinese bbq pizza burgers cheese table sushi seafood king crab legs shrimp oyster big dessert area with different chocolates ice cream and cake even nitro infused dessert made on the spot last thing a juice bar it was a bit pricey but with the selection it is fair dining area is good size and service was attentive,Positive
colony,i absolutely loved this buffet i came here for everyday for breakfast and lunch i would say the lunch is more spectacular than the breakfast spread they have sushi singapore food juices meats cheeses chinese food indian food a whole bread station and a beautiful dessert section lunch is special because you can get crab legs,Positive
colony,one of the highlights of our trip in singapore the buffet was to die for all you can eat sushi indian chinese dim sum soup etc it was amazing we also had the beverage package which came with bottomless wine our server was super sweet and really friendly everything we ate was delicious,Positive
colony,this place was excellent exactly what you would expect from a high quality buffet it had mainly malay chinese and indian food and every bit of it was so delicious i started off with the laksa which is one of my favorite dishes i have had in singapore then transitioned into the heavier foods they have a great spread of cold cuts pat and jamn ibrico aside a large selection of cheeses to choose from their sushi selection is not too extensive but it does have the main crowd favorites salmon tuna yellowtail they have both sashimi and nigiri as well as a few simple sushi rolls to choose from they had a great seafood selection and delicious fresh oysters too i loved their salted egg chicken wings they taste exactly like salted egg and are so so good very crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor i wish i had gotten more they also have a unique selection of bread the wheat and seaweed ones were my favorite the desserts were one of my favorite parts of the buffet there was every kind of pastry imaginable and you bet your ass i tried them all lol my favorites were the carmel brle truffles and gelato but there are so many more i am probably not remembering so be sure to give them all a taste they are small portions so as long as you pase yourself you should be fine the service was just as good as the food our server was cheetah i apologize i i spelled that incorrectly he was very attentive and checked up on us very frequently to clear our plates this place was a great experience but keep in mind it is very expensive we ordered all you can drink which was about  per person there were three of us and we totaled over  but this was for a special occasion and they even brought out a candle and a plate with not one but full of different pastries to sing me happy birthday,Positive
colony,the crowd as expected in a hotel is all tourists sometimes gems can be discovered in unexpected places despite the aging ritz carlton starting to appear more like an average marriott than a ritz the colony restaurant inside was a treat both in design and quality stepping into this uniquely designed space there is a sense of surprise and confusion the confusion arises from the vastly dispersed food selections throughout making the breakfast appear endless the dividers decorated with antiques and imagery of singapore provide a museum like feel to what would otherwise be a buffet selections are very vast making it difficult to make a decision every piece of the meal was amazing with the exception of one dish the chicken curry in the malay section which was not prepared well and the chicken very dry the service was spectacular and the buffet selections even beat out the st regis where we spent the last evening in singapore sitting next to the bamboo garden here is very relaxing and the building provides a fair share of natural light so do not get discouraged by the otherwise sad looking architecture of this building and the cramped boring entrance into the property this restaurant is a must for luxurious breakfast,Positive
colony,christmas hope log cake   starsdark chocolate ganache hazelnut biscuit gianduja crmeux raspberry mousse gelethis was pricey but absolutely delicious the cake was not too sweet and the flavors chocolate raspberry and hazelnut and textures the silky smooth cremeux melt in your mouth mousse and crunchy hazelnut complemented one another perfectly not to mention the fact that the cake was absolutely gorgeous with gold dust glittery gold streaks against the sheen of chocolate ganache and dark chocolate shapes that tasted divine i could not ask for more in a dessert best enjoyed at tea time with a cup of black coffee because i am usually too full after dinner and would not be able to appreciate it,Positive
colony,in one word awesome so much variety so much food good quality food make a reservation since it was quite well patronised even on a sunday there is lobster ball noodles really it is like a fishball duck and chicken rice northern indian food and naan and papadam leg of lamb and the usual suspects etc desserts a wide variety of desserts ice cream and i especially like the broken chocolate pieces like la maison is mendicant but only with nuts overall a good meal good service too,Positive
colony,i used to like to go to ritz carlton is colony restaurant for its buffet we went to colony this monday the restaurant was not full house though however we were given a make shift squeezed table of five by a service staff nina at first she refused to change table for us saying that the table is ok with  people and the restaurant was fully booked we told her to call for the manager then she agree to change to another proper table for  persons the food in the colony is getting very boring with declining quality the japanese counter sashimi and sushi are the standard offerings with no creativity the color and presentation of food were not attractive the worst is at the chinese counter the dim sum was terrible with no quality control the texture of dim sum was either rubbery and the sui mai texture was soft and starchy with no prawn and meat texture the laksa noodles gravy does not taste like laksa at all the gravy was over cooked with a burnt taste the dessert counter was boring and there were no outstanding desserts at all just average quality with variety i was not even tempted to take any dessert when i pass by the dessert counter service was excellent apart from the host blunder in table assignment i realized nowadays stars hotel like ritz carlton fullerton due to their reputation and good business have ignored their initial brand promise to customers they are sitting on their laurels because the numbers are good and get carried away with food quality and presentation of food no use of providing wide variety of food if as a six star hotel restaurants is unable to deliver a star professional attitude towards its operations in quality presentation and innovation of the food offerings to your customers i realized the so called  star hotel restaurants in singapore cannot be compared with those in thailand and hong kong the owners of  star hotels needs to shake up the hotel management staff and constantly keep them in checked to deliver the brand promise and commitment to their customers,Negative
colony,easily the highest quality buffet with so many options that i have ever been to this is the only buffet i have been to on multiple occasions that has been consistently high quality a bit of dim sum with some indian curry and some roast duck and some sushi top it off with a solid champagne and this place is everything desserts are phenomenal and i love that they make sure they have a local twist to most of them it is a great setting that everyone truly walks away happy i highly recommend for an excellent sunday brunch,Positive
colony,high quality buffet with ritz carlton service good food great selection especially for the sunday brunch and pricy,Positive
colony,great setup for breakfast and dinners broad range of cuisines fresh tuna and salmon sashimi salads chicken duck pork lamb beef fish prawns crab in addition to a range of indian malay and chinese dishes the desert range is fantastic in addition to ice cream and chocolate bars not bad for  ahi tuna salmon sashimi is very fresh braised red snapper is firm yet supple tandoori chicken spiced just right and the tiny sesame naans are but tasty,Positive
colony,what better way to start  than to write a yelp review for how  ended this is all about their nye buffet dinner oh what a night wow what a spread with quality festive party favours beyond just a hat free flow mot definitely check that alone is worth coming back service staff deserve extra brownie points for constantly being around and always having a yes we can attitude anticipating your needs generously topping up your champagne like there is no tomorrow clearing cutlery and plates that needed to be cleared and not those that you are still working on lending the young and old a helping hand whenever required always smiling making sure you have a great time and genuinely requesting your feedback food wise where do you start if cold seafood is your weakness you might well be stuck and not try anything but only inconvenience is the need to use your hands to prise open these succulent treasures but fear not as individual finger bowls are readily available and when you had enough of those aphrodisiacal oysters exploring colony will lead you to greater pleasures be it local or continental you will want one and also the other lobster laksa chilli crab tandoori and briyani with a whole lamb displayed spanish style sucking pig tomahawk steak beef wellington wagyu sliders bread and cheeses from every country ever however do pace yourself as the sweets sanctuary will make sure you and your stomach live happily ever after lessons learned drink do not drive oh and make sure someone else picks up the tab happy new year,Positive
colony,high end hotels in singapore know how to buffet colony is at the ritz carlton and  for dinner here is a steal what makes colony unique is that they not only have an impressive western selection but they have dedicated stalls that specialize in singaporean cuisine you can easily get famous dishes such as chicken rice chilli crab dim sum laksa with lobster and indian food here everything is high quality but if you are a tourist here i still recommend that you go outside and try all these at their respective restaurants for a more authentic experience as a resident here i decided to focus on their western spreads of course i loaded up on all the fancy cheeses and charcuterie i really enjoyed their roast along with all the curries in the indian section the desserts also had a western focus with things like cookies ice cream sundaes and pies though they did have some nice kuehs to choose from considering the ambiance and price this is a great place to go for special occasions with the family or celebrating a milestone birthday or job promotion with friends who are picky,Positive
colony,there are buffets and then there are buffets the colony at the ritz carlton is a buffet you literally dream about at some point during the buffet i literally thought i was stealing the sgd price per person vs the collection of food offered is simply absurd first the seafood bar is out of this world what buffet offers three types of oysters canadian french and irish so customers can different tasting oysters from sweet to salty to creamy to everything in between wow obviously these oysters are air flown from where ever they are located in the world so do not expect absolute freshness nevertheless it was more than satisfying next to the oyster baskets are whole crabs half cracked lobster claws the ones you find in maine mussels clams honestly i could not contain myself no where in singapore can eat  whole lobsters and a dozen oysters in one sitting and not break the bank other than the seafood bar there was a sushi sashimi bar indian buffet chinese singaporean buffet other note worthy dishes included all you can eat chilli crab claws butter grilled half cut lobster tails xo fried rice the ambience is great perfect for a friday night date and service is impeccable a must try indeed,Positive
colony,probably one of my favorite buffet spots in the city lovely colonial settings with a wide variety of meats cheeses warm charcuterie desserts food is delicious and the drinks are well balanced i have spent my birthday here brought friends here and if i could afford the calories i will be back sooner also when you are stuffed walk about the lobby of the ritz and admire the whimsical glass creations from chihuly i love chihuly,Positive
colony,after a six month period renovation the all time popular buffet restaurant arm of the ritz carlton millenia singapore opens with a new concept and name called colony which draws inspirations from the rich heritage of singapore is colonial history what could be better to relish an authentic afternoon tea experience than having a traditional british style three tier afternoon tea set here in fact decor is a key draw here i was instantly attracted to the eclectic settings when i stepped in adorned on the walls and partitions are old maps photographs alongside with vintage black and white crockery which i secretly wished i could bring some back home in line with the concept of the restaurant there is some local twist to what would otherwise be a strictly english tea the golden raisins and plan scones baked in house was served with scented kaya jam clotted cream and lemon curd which somehow reminds me of a delicious kaya toast when i put everything into my mouth the second deck and third deck feature an assortment of sandwiches and sweet pastries including a entire slab of peppered foie gras on beef pastrami simply too indulgent but if you jumped to the conclusion that it is the usual mixed of sweets savouries and scones then you are wrong it includes a plate of incredibly fluffy savoury pancake topped with sour cream and french caviar for that touch of luxe and when it comes to tea it is serious business here go for the signature brew called colony tea a custom blend of black and white sumatran tea leaves from tea bone zen mind that is soothing without any bitter or harsh tang the most unique aspect is the addition of flavored syrup such as french rose ginger lavender palm and cinnamon pandan and pineapple to enhance the tea they work to tease out the nuances of the tea and create a therapeutic experience as one slowly sips along with the light bites available daily except sundays this afternoon tea also comes with a glass of moet chandon brut imperial champagne indeed colony does not only set itself apart from other local high tea by virtue of its nostalgic charm the quality of food and tea are highly accomplished as well if you favour both substance and style this would fit the bill,Positive
colony,this place is spectacular it will cost you a pretty penny but the seafood is amazing oysters shrimp prawns omfg i was in seafood heaven that is just one station they also have the famous singapore hainan chicken with rice but you have to ask for it at one of many stations just thinking about this place reminds me of the deliciousness,Positive
colony,this is a review for a sunday buffet brunch at colony restaurant main level of the ritz carlton formerly branded as the greenhouse the ritz has put much thought and effort into reorganizing the buffet areas into a more consolidated and efficient operation they have also changed the feel of the dining room by adding partition walls that display framed stock photos all with the theme colonization the effect of the heavily used partition wall modules is that of a pottery barn store the feel is that all of the framed photos are on display to sell the only thing missing are the price tags the wall modules break up the large space creating a more intimate dining experience what is lost is the joy of people watching during the brunch with the serving stations all moved to a remote mostly hidden location at the rear of the restaurant and the partition walls segmenting the space into smaller dining areas the feel is not as good as the greenhouse the wide spectrum of food offerings are enough to please any palette local indian western seafood cheese breads desserts etc in addition to the free flow champagne bartenders are on duty to make bloody marys and espresso martinis i had several of each and both were delicious the staff is friendly well trained and attentive champagne glasses were always kept full empty plates continually cleared and bloody marys and martinis delivered upon request the good food quality staff ambiancethe bad i am not a fan of the maze like new partition wall modules that detract from the grand architectural space and prefer the more open and spacious feel of the greenhouse hands down the greenhouse was a much better brunch experience the verdict colony is a prime player in the singapore sunday brunch scene glad to have visited but i think i will wait for the bi annual super brunch before returning,Positive
colony,this is one of the best hotel buffet i have ever been great quality of food the seafood like oysters shells crab legs are really fresh also like the roast beef and india cuisine there will definitely come back worth the price,Positive
colony,one of the best buffets i have tried in singapore they have a wide selection of seafood alaskan king crab and the oysters are to die for they also have a wide variety of meats cheese and i also love the chinese herb soup they served the ambiance was perfect and the service is excellent we got very good service from cory the assistant manager natalie was the food server who assisted us both were superb and made us not only love the food but also love their service i love it so much that i went back in less than a week that i visited singapore,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,this hit the spot and you can find many of them sprawled around singapore it was great for an afternoon tea coffee break while also substituting as a rest stop for some ac in the hot singapore weather i recommend the usual kaya toast with pandan and butter as well as a an iced coffee or kopi it is made with condensed milk and not your usual iced coffee here but it is the right amount of sweetnedd without being overwhelming this chain has been around for years and i cannot complain i think the only thing that could make it better was more butter on the bread,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,something to try if you want a simple meal especially breakfast in singapore get the kaya toast with butter set and make sure to dunk that toast in the eggs drink it down with some delicious coffee is it a life changing meal no but it just hits the spot and is extremely cheap,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,ya kun has dozens of outlets in singapore but this is the original location it was conveniently located near our hotel in chinatown and was a great way to start the morning it was his first time in singapore and we shared one order of kaya toast eggs and tea it was not a bad way to spend a few dollars,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,ya kun is a local breakfast store good speed and highly recommend for first time travellers,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,despite the many recommendations that came to us from friends to try this place when visiting singapore it had just an average impression on us food kaya toast   it is just toast with their famous spread butter while it is definitely unique taste wise it was just ok soft boiled eggs   i am a huge fan of eggs and was excited for this but this also was just ok service is quick and fast be prepared to pay as soon as your food comes out that is just the way they roll here while i would still recommend newcomers to singapore to try this place when visiting i would say it is a one time visit spot only,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,it is hard to miss ya kun kaya they are everywhere in singapore this particular joint is located near far east square a much bigger venue than the other ya kun kaya outlets plus point that they are open at   am to have your early breakfast in solitude their menu is simple it is all about toast coffee tea soft boiled eggs but those three things have served me well i got the savory chasu toast and the durian kaya toast the chasu toast was quite flavorful but the durian kaya toast won a sweet spot in my heart perfectly toasted crisp bread sandwiching the rich and creamy durian paste added with kaya and butter delicious and they smell so good sniff sniff p service was not exactly friendly but at least they are speedy and efficient overall ya kun kaya toast is an awesome spot to get your quick breakfast fix i will most definitely be back,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,really good kaya toast and coffee it is a bit strange with the whole paying and ordering system first you sit down someone comes and takes your order then your drink will come out first and you pay when your toast gets here and the lady tells you the amount in our case we order two sets of toasts so she asked for the money when my first toast got to the table and asked us to pay again when my second toast arrived until i gave her a weird look and she said you paid i said yes you collected the money two minutes ago be careful of their inefficient system,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,a classic establishment in singapore would go for the famous kaya toast which is surprisingly good considering how simple the dish is their kaya paste is not too sweet and has a good sticky texture the bread is toasted well and the butter adds to the decadence creaminess the traditional coffee tea kopi teh are ok you can find better ones elsewhere,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,i wanted in on this kaya business as i saw references to it everywhere asked my friend km what it actually was just toast with asiany brioche like bread with a slather of coconut jam atop liked so much i ordered it again at terminal  in changi where there is also a little first floor kiosk,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,this place was closed for  days for chinese new year but finally opened on last day of our singapore trip had to try the traditional breakfast this place has interesting history that you can read about while waiting in the queue once we ordered the food came out fairly quickly it is a family business and the service was excellent the coffee was amazing and made the old fashion way w a sock order one of the kaya value sets and you cannot go wrong great prices too would highly recommend this place for traditional kaya toast,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,put down that nasty free hostel breakfast and go spend the  sgd on breakfast here gotta eat kaya toast when in sing it is their version of dessert for breakfast this is the orig so skip all the makeup and go sweat it out at breakfast the sweetened iced coffee is strong and delicious runny eggs you should mix a little with soy sauce and salt yum as others suggested bring wet wipes kaya will glue to your fingers and sing is a land of byot tissue wherever you go staff is so very friendly but when the boss lady walks around to collect before you eat better pay up quick,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,although this place is a chain i am still a big fan of this classic singaporean breakfast chain the usual kaya toast with butter and soft boiled eggs and iced milo is the winning combo my boyfriend and i walked into this place on one morning and got told that the hot drinks maker was down but singapore is always warm anyway so why get the hot drinks we were however puzzled on how on earth the soft boiled eggs would be consumed but the instinct took over and we soon munched the toast dipped in egg like a local would service is neither friendly nor rude just the usual efficiency you see in singapore and i was at least being grateful to be greeted in english and not chinese as everyone in chinatown assumed that i could speak mandarin in which i could not i would still go to this place again if i am nearby but for now a jar of kaya jam bought from singapore should do the trick when i am at home in copenhagen it wo not be the same but at least i did not have to endure the  hour flight,Negative
ya-kun-kaya-toast,wow amazing it is so simple but so good kaya is the coconut jam that is spread onto the toast then they also put a sliced of butter in the middle i love how it is dipped into the soft boiled egg the whole combination is quite unique do not forget to add the sweet soy sauce into the egg this is a popular shop with numerous franchises all over town i find this location is decor to stand out more than ones you find at the malls so come to this shop it is also in a nice area with other restaurants because this is obviously just an appetizer,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,i actually did not go to this location but i could not find a yelp page for the location that i did go to it was in some mall that is connected to my hotel so i am just going to post my review here loli came to ya kun kaya toast for breakfast and ordered the kaya butter toast set  which came with a coffee and runny eggs the coffee was good but it did not taste that out of the ordinary i have a really weak stomach when it comes to runny eggs and these eggs were superrrrr runny so i did not eat them and cannot comment on how good it is but the kaya toast omg so good i will admit that i felt a little sick afterwards because of how buttery and sweet it was but it was so worth it the jam that they put in it was heaven highly recommend a visit if you are in singapore,Negative
ya-kun-kaya-toast,starbucks singapore style style there are are several of these in singapore they do coffee soft boiled eggs and toast with butter and kaya coconut jam comfort food my only gripe is they have too much butter and not enough jam on their toast,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,my friend highly recommended the coconut jam here and told us to save room after dinner to try their toast good thing we walked around before trying this place out and glad i had extra room to stuff this down my husband had a small cup of coffee he said it was too sweet for him i personally did not try this so i cannot comment on that hes also the type of person who drinks coffee black with no sugar or creams their ya kun kaya toast omg i just have to say i have never had anything like this before super delicious where it wasnt super sweet and just the right amount of jam to make me want to finosh my toast even if i was full from dinner pleaseeee open in the us i saw they had multiple locations around asia but non in the us im going to be sad once my jar runs out of jam soooo delicious once you try it youre gonna wanna bring a ton back home,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,love ya kun kaya this was our first ever bite of kaya toast we came here for breakfast one morning before exploring s pore is clarke quay and chinatown areas this is the original yk location and it automatically feels authentic and historic this location has the most seating out of all the other yk locations we visited there is outside seating as well as fans equipped inside tables we the set of kaya toast and sugar kaya toast with iced coffee tea and soft boiled eggs holy smokes we have never had kaya toast or traditional singaporean brekkie before and our minds were blown i still salivate a little thinking about that delicious savory runny and sweet crunchy combo pandan is what makes up a lot of the kaya spread and by golly it is amazing the servers here all speak flawless english and mandarin as well as other languages bosses the service was amazingly quick and efficient and their menus are easy to navigate so fret not foreigners shoutout to the amazing staff we were tourists totally soaking up the atmosphere and delicious food but we also saw lots of locals eating here from families to single customers,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,classic singaporean breakfast that you have to try the toast on its own is really sweet but the key to enjoying it is to add soy sauce to the liquid eggs mix it up and then dunk the toast into the egg mixture making sure it is well coated do not be afraid to scoop more on top the cold drinks were good as well,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,quintessential singaporean breakfast kaya toast runny eggs and coffee well i do not drink coffee so i had tea with milk and sugar instead a really nice man asked me if i was eating there or for takeaway and when i said it was for there he told me to take a seat anywhere and then brought over a menu i got the above mentioned breakfast set which was set a there was a set b c and d which had different kinds of kaya toast i remember set d was a kaya peanut butter toast which also sounded amazing the kaya butter toast was pretty delicious the bread is very toasted and crispy at one point the nice old man sat down with me and showed me how to properly eat kaya toast he asked to put soy sauce and some black pepper into my runny eggs then i mixed it and he told me to dip my toast into the runny egg soy sauce mixture really tasty great hearty way to start the day,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,this review is for the coffee only the black coffee with the condense milk has a very bold flavor but is easy to drink wish this was available in the usa so good,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,i do not care what anyone else says this is the best thing i ate in singapore i got the standard set butter kaya toast with milk tea and  soft boiled eggs it was delicious and the only thing i could ever ask for in a breakfast toast was perfectly crunchy and toasted the butter inside not yet melted which is apparently how it is supposed to be the kaya was the perfect amount of sweetness my friend who just got an iced coffee said it was delicious too do not think you can go wrong here i could eat this everyday,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,obsessed with kaya toast one of the few spots i went religiously every morning on my trip great spot with fast service tips try the white bread kaya toast no crust soft delightful kaya toast comes with a sliver of butter inside with kaya coffee coffee with milk coffee o black coffee with sugar coffee c coffee with sugar cream condensed milk,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,straight forward no frill solid kaya toast ya kun dates back decades perfecting the kaya toast and you just cannot go wrong when there is barely a menu and the auntie asking you straight up how many you know you have come to the authentic place the toasts are crunchy on the outside and sweet and tad creamy inside hmmm taste of singapore in one small bite,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,this was a very solid breakfast that felt very authentic while this was my first time having kaya toast the down to earth staff and the other people reflected how this is not a tourist trap type restaurant now about the actual foodkaya toast kaya jam is made from eggs coconut and pandan while eating the kaya toast the flavor is primarily sweet with a hint of coconut richness and a whiff of floral pandan but sweetness is really the primary impression here also due to the generous spread of butter margarine kaya toast feels a lot heavier than you might expect i thought that the soft and runny soft boiled eggs would be too much for me but i think the quality of the eggs are better here or they are just perfectly cooked they did not have any of that raw eggy aroma that can sometimes make me retch a bit milk tea not quite as rich as hong kong milk tea i think the uht milk gives it a bit more of a cooked milk flavor which is quite nice it is not too sweet has some decent depth of tea flavor,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,firstly this review is for the store in united square off thompson rd but i could not find it on yelp i ordered the toast set which comes with two soft boiled eggs two kaya and butter toast sandwiches and a cup of coffee all in all a fairly good deal for the price the meal brought back many memories from my past and it felt good,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,i can not find any listing for the ya kun kaya toast located at tiong bahru plaza  tiong bahru road singapore i have therefor posted it here but i wish to stress that this review is in no way reflective of the other outlets this is not a one day occurrence in fact it happened two days in a row i went there to have a cup of coffee and some kaya toast the coffee came out after five minutes i finished drinking it before the toast came out  minutes later and stone cold how long i ask you does it take to make toast what were they doing grinding the wheat to make the flour to make the dough to bake the bread to slice it so that they could make toast next day same deal coffee after a few minutes and then the wait and wait and wait finally after waiting  minutes for kaya toast and outrageous amount of time even by the pitifully poor standards of service in singapore i very obviously got up and walked out even after i had ordered and paid can you imagine a singaporean getting up and walking out after paying for food and not getting it that would never happen the service in this place stink stinks it stinks to high heaven it stinks worse than rotten tuna fish left out on a hot august day how is that for hyperbole i challenge any singaporean to verbally spar with me on this issue this place deserves to go out of business,Negative
ya-kun-kaya-toast,ordered menu a kaya toast with two runny eggs and tea with condensed milk not very good toast looked sad and did not taste anything special waste of a meal,Negative
ya-kun-kaya-toast,this is a very famous singaporean style breakfast brunch cafe they have locations all over singapore supposedly they have been in business since  our aunt took us there to try it like most of the local markets in singapore the place is cramped although not outdoors the small wooden chairs and tables are packed tightly together that it is hard to get around when crowded yet it is worth the wait even with the long queue line they have a very strong milk tea that is best served hot get the kaya toast with butter you can usually mix it up with two runny eggs or you can just have it plain either way you will enjoy the lightness of the bread the crunch of the toast and the rich full bodied taste of the coffee come here if you want to enjoy a good start to the day,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,i came here twice in four days for breakfast it is a very simple setup you get four toast sandwiches with kaya coconut spread and butter as fillers and then you dip slather with two soft boiled eggs all served with coffee or milk tea all for   sgd it is a satisfying way to start the day everything comes out moments after being ordered,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,you must come here for the kaya toast and milk treat they are a perfect combo to start off your day,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,hmmm kinda runny for my taste but glad i tried it id eat it again and bought kaya jam to give out as a present,Negative
ya-kun-kaya-toast,ya kun has the best toast and coffee as compared to other similar local cafes this particular branch is also the only branch i know that serves you at the table if you are dining in butter sugar toast is also worth trying i prefer that to kaya,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,so apparently this is the traditional singaporean breakfast coffee brewed in bags which you can see hanging up runny eggs and kaya toast coconut jam french toast kinda thing in a stripped back functional cafe ya kun is a franchise there is a model of the first store in here but do not expect anything posh and fancy half the point is that it is as was metal tables and chairs plastic cutlery but hey who cares as long as the food is good right and it was coffee with condensed milk runny eggs with a dash of soy and kaya toast all delicious they have a few different options combinations all of which are cheap definitely worth a visit if you get the chance,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,this is the original ya kun kaya toast shop it is just outside of the far east square along china street with a few other great eateries if you are ever visiting singapore everyone will tell you to try the famous kaya toast at ya kun i honestly think you should try kaya toast when you are in singapore but not at ya kun i like toast box better i do not understand the hype of this place i am not a fan of over toasted hard bread with very little kaya jam and way too much butter i had to go to another kaya toast shop later that day just to make up for the disappointing experience i just wanted to try one slice of their toast with the kaya jam but they suckered me in to their pricey combo special  toasts soft boiled egg and a drink overall i was super disappointed with my first kaya toast experience here service  starskaya toast  staropening hoursmonday to friday  am to  pmsaturday and sunday  am to  pmpublic holiday closed,Negative
ya-kun-kaya-toast,how is ya kun only   stars kaya toast was a must when i visited singapore my friends and i first tried kaya toast at nanyang old coffee and thought it was so good that we wanted kaya toast again we found ya kun and now i am constantly craving it we ordered  different toast sets kaya toast with butter butter sugar toast kaya peanut toastthe sets come with a stack of  toasts  soft boiled eggs and a choice between iced coffee and milk tea my favorite toast by miles was the kaya peanut toast so good the bread here is thin and crunchy which i preferred over nanyang which was thicker and softer i think the thin bread makes for a better bread to kaya filling ratio and crunchy food is just better than soft food the other two toasts were pretty good as well not as memorable compared to the kaya peanut but i still enjoyed them there was a little too much butter in the normal kaya toast though the soft boiled eggs were cooked nicely and the iced coffee was pretty average i would definitely recommend coming here for breakfast or lunch or dinner or all three try the normal kaya toast but you must get the peanut toast as well,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,ya kun which has dozens of outlets across the city does traditional singaporean breakfast kaya toast soft boiled eggs coffee i am crazy addicted to soft boiled eggs doused in soy sauce so i have been in a lot or to one of their other shops for breakfast their kaya toast is good too white bread toasted to the point of crunchiness with a thin spread of kaya in between and a lot of butter four huge pats of unmelted butter per sandwich which is way too much for me so i always request without this location is the original and kind of neat because they still use the traditional marble topped tables and wooden chairs,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,i like coming to ya kun when i am in singapore yes it is overhyped among tourists but i still find myself coming back every time the food is solid it is very filling too i feel like i could skip lunch after eating the full breakfast here if you come early enough you may even avoid the tourists who generally comes later during the day,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,if you want to meet the rudest person in singapore go see the lady who makes the toast in the morning enough to ruin my impression of this place for a first time surprised a franchise allows this,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,during my first visit to singapore i knew i wanted to try kaya toast for breakfast luckily ya kun kaya toast was right next to our hotel amoy while i knew this was a chain every time we walked by this location it was full of people so i figured it still had to be good if locals were frequenting it haha we came right around opening am i think and the place wasnt crowded yet of course i had to order the kaya toast with butter set  usd that comes with boiled eggs and kopi i must say that i thought the kaya jam was a bit too sweet for me but when dipped into the soft boiled eggs it was delicious and omg i was all about that kopi the kopi still had a strong flavor and the condensed milk gave it just enough sweetness service was quick and efficient but this was a quick breakfast stop anyway so i wasnt expecting anything more haha loved my first taste of a singaporean breakfast,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,so i like too much butter and i do not care if it is melted or not and iced coffee to wash the toast down with was perfect for me i did not eat enough kaya toast in different places to make proper comparisons and having just gotten off a really long flight and not adjusting well to singapore is weather i def did not want to eat half boiled eggs with soy but i could see how the contrast with the sweet toast would work well,Negative
ya-kun-kaya-toast,i remember asking everyone about what i should eat or buy when i was in singapore kaya toast came up multiple times i was like yeah that sounds so good in reality i was thinking what the eff is kaya for those of you who do not know kaya is a spread made with coconut eggs sugar and pandan or so wikipedia says so i walked into ya kun kaya toast and of course ordered the kaya toast with butter and decided on an iced milk tea to go with it i guess this is a very traditional breakfast for singaporeans so i had to try it since breakfast is my absolute favorite meal of the day i could seriously eat it for every meal i loved the flavor of the kaya and it meshed really well with the toasted warm bread the butter was something i had a hard time with i felt like when i got to the middle of the toast i was just eating an entire tablespoon of butter along with the toast kaya i could seriously feel my arteries clogging by the second however when i asked a singaporean if it was supposed to be like that she said yes and the butter is the best part perhaps i am not cultured enough to understand all that butter and next time i am just going to get kaya toast no butter i mean the butter was good i just could not stand eating it knowing that it was just a chunk of butter on the other hand the milk tea here had good flavor although it was a little too sweet for my liking however it was a great drink to drink with my food overall my first experience with kaya was really good and i even went to the store later on to purchase a jar of it to bring home i am just going to cut down on the butter when i do make my own,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,i knew i had to at least try a traditional singaporean breakfast before leaving the menu is stripped back and simple choose from coffee tea kaya kaya french toast all for the equivalent of about  quid this is a stripped back as others have mentioned cafe and if you are in a rush it is probably best to order at the counter and take it to go once you seat yourself it is all about getting the attention of the staff so you definitely need to make your presence known by a few waves and constant eye contact my food came out piecemeal coffee then  minutes later eggs and another  later the toast but luckily i had the whole morning to hang around so enjoyed people watching in the interim this was clearly a super popular spot and you can see why if you like a breakfast on the sweeter side you will likely enjoy this runny egg jam and french toast like concoction with sweet singapore coffee be prepared for the sugar rush that follows and do not forget to bring your own wet wipes napkins probably an obvious for most of you used to singapore but i was constantly walking around with sticky hands,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,i guess everybody has their preference on where to get the best kaya toast but ya kun is definitely one of my favorites the thin toast runny soft boiled eggs and teh tarik make a great breakfast and for s  you just cannot beat it anywhere,Positive
ya-kun-kaya-toast,kaya toast overrated eggs in soy and hard dried out toast with a slab of butter much better meals to be had,Negative
killiney-kopitiam,i am obsessed kaya toast became an obsession in singapore and i ate it every morning for the duration i was in singapore this place is super local and super cheap the staff here is super warm and friendly they explained how to eat the kaya toast to me here although i had been warned and watched youtube videos on how to do but i appreciated the friendliness i went a little bit after it opened and there were quite a few customers already lots of people that were definitely regulars as the person at the register knew their orders the food came out quickly and the ordering process is really swift definitely always get the soft boiled eggs with the kaya toast it is everything i wish they had places with real kaya toast in the us,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,i came here after reading all the great reviews but was a bit disappointed tbh i wanted to start my day with authentic singaporean breakfast kaya toast and eggs with kopi and hence got here the food was good but the place was too small and cramped service was bad and staff was unfriendly you need to first wait to be seated then note your table number and then go to the counter to place the order you need to mention the table number when you place your order and they will bring the food to your table we were seated in a table and once i went to the counter to place the order they moved my family over to a different table i had to go back and change the order again to update the table number also they do not provide you napkins so make sure you get your own or have a back up plan portions were very small and even though i placed  orders of the breakfast they brought all the food in one plate i had to then ask them to get us additional plates bowls utensils since  of us would be eating what were they thinking food was good but there are many other places with much better service and much better food and portions i would skip this one and find a better place,Negative
killiney-kopitiam,if you are looking for something local and fast this is the place to come we came in at  right before a crowd came in so we had no trouble finding a table the servers are kind and attentive i am giving them three stars because the food was okay we ordered the bread toast laksa and nasi lemak with otah for drinks we ordered the organic chinese tea and the coffee with milk,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,this place became our daily morning ritual on our trip to singapore for some reason we were up by am almost everyday and with waking up came the hunger a quick search in yelp showed this place open it close to our hotel so that was a plus as well and so we went the food was great it was tasty and inexpensive the place was clean enough my only gripe is that they do not give you any napkins i noticed a lot of places here do not so if you are messy eater like myself bring some on your own other than that our experience here was more than satisfactory it fed us when we were hungry at an odd time in the morning it was tasty cheap and clean enough the chicken curry was easily the best dish would definitely recommend,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,delicious curry chicken rice for   the curry rice come with thick fragrant gravy with a lot of potatoes and meat fast serving and big portion definitely will return for lunch,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,i did not know such old school kopitiam still exists today and right in the heart of orchard road at that i was having a post wedding staycation at lloyd is inn and the stay includes a breakfast set at this place we came late and coincided with the lunch crowd who were mainly there for some after lunch coffee tea we ordered the simple toast set french toast set which was simple and yet so filling my french toast set had egg mixed in with the bread and layered on top with kaya and a slice of butter on the side it reminded me of my primary school days breakfast that my grandma made for me i vow to recreate this at home next time i also ordered the ginger tea sans milk and it was very hot in my tummy and strong good for removing excess wind in the stomach will certainly drop by this place again if i am craving some good ole toast and coffee tea a tip is to come here before or after the lunch crowd say before pm or from pm onwards,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,delicious local breakfast my husband was doubting me but he def enjoyed it we got kopi kaya toast and soft boiled eggs it is a quick breakfast that gets you in and out mostly locals order than find a seat it gets busy,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,yes yes and more yes simplest breakfast foods ever but so good that i had it twice during my stay in singapore kaya toast soft boiled eggs and soy milk with grass jelly cost no more than  sgd walk up to the counter order pay sit down and out comes to the food nothing fancy just plain and simple this place is an institution and has a lot of history to it great to visit and to try especially how cheap it is this one is also the original in singapore so def visit consider also getting a jar of the kaya spread you can even try to make it yourself at home i did,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,great little spot i came with a full stomach but needed to try the kaya toast it was simple  pieces of bread with kaya spread and slices of butter but it was packed with flavor move over nutella toast because kaya toast got you beat definitely get the soya milk with grass jelly to wash it down with the humid weather in singapore this drink is more than refreshing,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,i wanted a taste to see what a typical singaporean breakfast would be like this place was really packed in the morning i ordered two types of sweet toast and some fried noodle rolls everything was super sweet it was definitely unique and worth a try especially if you are a tourist,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,hands down the best traditional s pore breakfast i have had during my week here the first kaya breakfast i had in my life was at the big chain ya kun kaya toast you can see it in the food levels of singapore is many malls around the city or like we also did visit the original location on china street in between telok ayer and chinatown but killiney is original location on killiney road a little walk is away from somerset was just as quaint and much more delicious in my opinion their system of ordering is at the cashier once you have found a table you cannot order items unless you can provide a table number so if you are with a buddy have them take over a table while someone else puts the orders in major key we had their soft boiled eggs and kaya toast mee cheong mee siam and iced tea coffee we ate like kings for about   i believe i do not remember the actual amount but it should be around that price pretty great for singapore my favorite was their kaya toast so much thicker and still crisp compared to ya kun is and their spread was less sugary like ya kun does it i even bought a jar of kaya spread to take home to the states i loved it that much kaya is essentially pandan coconut milk eggs and sugar i cannot wait to use it on my toast at home their iced tea was so good not overly sweet like at ya kun and definitely freshly made with fresh foam on top of my cup we were so excited about our first order that at the end i put in an order for mee siam after looking around their shop at the photos that was not my favorite item but the egg was cooked to perfection and the sauce was a hint spicy with lots of flavor service is quick and their workers are all bosses at efficient food running and order taking hats off,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,stopped by here one morning to have breakfast during my visit to singapore it was not a great experience it was a combination of language barrier overly spicy food for breakfast and a jam packed interior most of what we ordered was not available their boiled eggs were essentially raw even after we made a request for done eggs not coming back to this particular one for sure,Negative
killiney-kopitiam,the kopi i miss it so much i love that it is piping hot chocolatey rich supremely strong yet smoothly moves through your mouth like silk i love that you can buy a package of their coffee i had the curry and it was excellent a weird mix with a cuppa coffee but who cares minusone star for the lack of air conditioning,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,open seating and it is always full in the mornings we went there on a sunday morning around am and it was packed come am and there is a few vacant tables already food is simple yet good i had the soft boiled eggs with kaya toast hot coffee and iced tea really good you can also buy their kaya jam jar to take home,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,honey ginger tea they use real ginger and the tea is strong and soothing for  it is a pretty good dealit is cash only,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,we stumble upon this amazing breakfast place i have never had kaya toast and wanted to try omg it was so good also i ordered the ginger milk tea amazing and the laksa noodles i was super impressed with everything and will head back before i leave tomorrow,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,from the regent hotel the walk is about   minutes arrived at around  am jet lagged and a hungry early bird looking for a worm this place did the job had the coffee with sweetened condensed milk very sweet and strong also had and loved the soft boiled egg and an order of french toast both very good the system is simple here you pay first and they deliver your food to you was disappointed that the laksa was not available but i think it is only a lunch item here i enjoyed the random jokes and philosophical tidbits scattered about the cool white walls for some reason i enjoyed the cool intensely white lit interior of the establishment normally this kind of vibe gives me a migraine especially in the morning but it worked here for some reason i tried a couple of the malay dishes but did not like them as thought they were too sweet i ate them quickly only as a matter if formality will finish with the insightful philosophical message posted on a sign on the wall here that put my morning in perspective teens you have all the time and energy but no money workers you have the money and energy but no time oldies you have all the time and money but no more energy lesson enjoy life and all the things you have at the moment because you cannot have everything at once,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,killiney kopitiam is a great place for a fast meal snack it is in every way a kopitiam with stools and rough tables and nothing much the atmosphere is noisy order and pre pay your food about the only service is when they serve the food this is not a criticism the food is good and reasonably priced for singapore we liked the chicken curry cheong fan french toast with kaya bread roll with kaya chendol and kopi if you are visiting the area try it it still has the character of yesteryears my only fault with the place is it is not wheel chair friendly there is a step down from the adjoining shops and from the  foot path,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,my mom found this place thru a guidebook in japanese and decided to try it we ordered kaya butter toast and it was delicious i could eat a dozen of them we never got to try any other item but maybe next time the place is very small and very crowded so you gotta hover around the tables there is no waiting list for the tables you just gotta grab it we later found out that there is another location at the airport so you can try their kaya toast without making your way all the way to this location,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,delicious kaya toast and french bread the egg was nice and runny perfect for dipping,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,i love finding little local spots like this full of locals so you know it has got to be good i recommend the laksa and french bread kaya toast over the french toast the coffee is pretty good as well i have eaten a lot of laksa over the last few weeks and i think killiney kopitiam has the best laksa broth its very flavorful and well balanced the toppings are pretty basic in comparison to most places but it gets the job done it is just so good do not miss out on ordering it they have a system for ordering this is important i travelled solo so it was a little difficult to get it down step one find a seat and mark your territory put an umbrella down on the table step two note your table number step three go up to the front place your order you must give them your table number you will see a menu on the wooden panel on the left side of the cashier point to things if you need to i did step four wait for your food and enjoy,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,grabbed breakfast here got coffee soft boiled eggs rice cake and some type of toast coffee has condensed milk in it so it was super sweet the toast was also really sweet as well i am not a fan of sweets really and i do not usually eat breakfast either definitely not my first choice but my friends liked it service was nice and attentive,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,a great place to grab a cheap and delicious breakfast in fact i went here twice for breakfast while in singapore the kaya spread that had a unique combination of mildly sweet yet savory taste to it i would recommend the french toast and spread some of that kaya goodness with it the coffee also goes well with the toast the coffee is also well balanced and goes well with the toast keep in mind that the coffee with cream is sweet due to the condensed milk that they use so order without sugar so you can adjust the sweetness after you have tasted it i also order the laksa which was creamy and cocconuty with a slight spice kick it was not too spicy but just enough,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,just brilliant hits the spot excellent service reasonable price love the shared seating do yourself a favor and get their laksa every morning,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,excellent home made kaya toast and white coffee for breakfast service is fast and food is cheap too,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,this is one of my must eats when i am back in singapore worked close by a few years ago and had my breakfast here almost every day my absolute favourite is mea siam love the spicy tangy soup and the generous portion and very reasonable price service is so so though after a while once staff knows you it becomes a family affair do not forget to get some iced milo to go with it or top it off with some kaya toast you really cannot go wrong here as all is delicious a word of caution though killiney kopitiam has various outlets around singapore however the food is not as you would expect from a chain the tastes and quality of the food vary greatly from outlet to outlet so if you want the best then stick to killiney road seating is usually limited with some waiting involved especially in the morning,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,i walked by this shop almost daily for weeks without realizing how much of a singaporean institution it is i did notice that it was packed almost all day every day no matter the time nor weather my partner and i stopped by one sunday afternoon for a lunch and iced coffee after i discovered its notoriety you order and pay at the front counter so its better to know what you want before you come in its usually pretty busy but especially packed in the mornings the menu is pretty limited and i did not have the chance to try too much but there is a nice variety of items to choose from whether you want a snack or a meal i have had the chicken curry with prata and it was delicious the curry itself was rich and flavorful with a couple of bone in pieces of chicken and potatoes the prata is perfect for soaking up the spicy curry goodness the iced kopi was a perfect mix of rich strong coffee and creamy sweetness and it was perfectly priced all in all the meal is incredibly tasty and the price cannot be beat if its reputation does not pull you in its value will,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,got the french bread kaya toast and wholemeal bun kaya toast and they were both great also got mee rebus n that was pretty good got a lil kick to it kids loved their french bread kaya toast so much had to buy a few jars to take back home to cali love their quick n friendly service n u gotta love the prices,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,a great place to have your coffee and if you want to know what this first store of a big kopitiam chain is like go in pick your table go to the counter and make your order mentioning your table number the coffee is tasteful not just a bland black water the softboiled eggs are perfect could not ask more from a good kopitiam place,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,first day in singapore and this place was near the hotel was looking for kaya toast and killiney was recommended it was very good and cheap set a   sing small shop and very busy and people were eating all sorts of things for breakfast i think i may return to try some variety but there is food everywhere in the area and i have got a few days coffee dark with condensed milk hit the spot,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,love this place fatty but amazing the kaya toast had coconut pandan and egg white the flavors are sooooooo good if you are a pineapple bun fan you will definitely love this i was in singapore for  days and came here every day,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,it was really my first taste of the authentic singaporean breakfast of kaya toast egg and topi for my standards i thought it was pretty darn good the coffee is strong but not over powering i love the sweetness from the condensed milk the eggs were done perfectly and the toast had a good amount of coconut jam kaya and was crunchy enough to soak up all the egg deliciousness tip do not be afraid to add soy sauce to the eggs because it adds a extra layer of flavour to the egg and sweet bread combination,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,this landmark kopitiam is where i go when i am usually craving a quick bite of unhealthy local fare i am here like maybe once a week it is not air conditioned and has a very old school feel the food is admittedly pretty average but it is always crowded with locals at all hours i always get the laksa although personally i feel the katong laksa tastes better and chee cheong fun my friends are fans of the mee siam i like their teh si peng which is just nice in its sweetness i top my meal off with a local dessert like cheng tng or grass jelly with longan price wise it is still in the cheap range although it is expensive for a kopitiam the manager of the restaurant who takes my orders is this friendly chinese woman who is always happy to have a chat and a laugh,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,chicken curry is a better choice compared to the mee rebus i do not think i can appreciate this kind of food the staff is nice though,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,am and they are packed like sardines in a can from taxi drivers to policemen to working crowd on their way to the office seating space can be a little crampy you order at one counter pay at another then grab a sit and your order will find it is way to you a french loaf set is only   you get a good cup of teh c  half boiled eggs mine was slightly overcooked todaylocal sized baguette toasted well to melt the kaya and butter spread within it can be messy to eat as a result but they have an easy to access tap for washing up afterwards parking is definitely a nightmare and tickets will fly for illegal parking around here,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,epitome of the meaning a little goes a long way the menu is quite simple with just a couple of main breakfast items the ambiance is very local and can feel like an old school breakfast cafe in the colonial times maybe i am overdoing that but still feels authentically singapore kaya toast w butter the basic high calorie high fast working mans breakfast chicken curry w roti a great go to local breakfast meal be careful as the curry splashes laksa same thing splashesassorted breakfast drinks but my favorite is the ginger tea w milk these are the only things i eat when i break bread here i guess i am a creature of habit i tell you though with their consistently good turn around i can gather that the everything else is good stuff to,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,this is the place where it all began where everyone is treated as an equal and where the lines know no end there was a time when kaya toast was hard to find when half boiled eggs were a rarity and dark sauce symbolized true darkness not anymore but i will still keep coming back here for both the good vibes and the memories,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,authentic traditional singapore breakfast we ordered and just watched to get a feel for how exactly to tackle the meal my mistake was getting the french toast first time my husband got the regular toast with the kaya and i made sure to get that our second time in get your table order sit and enjoy good coffee quick service the eggs were runny enough and the toast was perfect to dip,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,killiney kopitiam is a mainstay in singapore is breakfast culture and has been for many years they know it too they sell small jars of fresh kaya that can be carefully packaged for a long flight well singapore is just one island so all the flights are international there is a number of things you can buy as gifts i have actually done this and it is a great gift for friends or family come to killiney during morning primetime and you will likely be queuing up outside and or hovering around a table waiting for people to finish feeding themselves the queue for ordering food is also a bit annoying it is disorganized and right next to people sitting at tables frequently you have to move around to let servers go by or let customers in out considering the size of the place this should be expected and in singapore space is at a premium so it is not a huge issue your average hawker center probably has less room to maneuver as for the food it is the best kaya toast i have had in singapore the laksa and mee rebus are both great and their kopi c teh c yuan yang drinks are all top notch the french loaf kaya toast and soft boiled eggs combination is something i have recommended to many of my friends before and also unique to singapore i have checked no one else sells a french loaf like this it is kind of like banh mi bread a baguette that is toasted and crispy but soft and fluffy at the same time the kaya is fresh and when combined with the melted butter is heaven in your mouth it is hard not to eat  of these french loaves when they are such a good value a french loaf  eggs and a kopi will be about half the price of any other sit down breakfast in singapore sometimes the staff can be a bit rude probably because they are an institution for kaya toast and the queue is pretty constant during the entire morning most of the time i had pleasant experiences with the staff and most of the time my table was clean when i sat down again this is about what you can expect with low cost casual dining in singapore i should say this this killiney kopitiam location is the original and the best by far i have always had great quality food here whereas other locations are very hit and miss usually a miss i started going out of my way to come here even though i was working within walking distance of the raffles location just do not think that the rating and quality of this place will be the same island wide or at the airport,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,this joint is the perfect place to step back from the hustle and bustle of orchard street during the day to grab a kopi or a perfect start to the day this place is old with chipped tables and plates and always crowded but the modus operandi is to grab the first empty chair and signal the old man or woman over and get the morning started with slices of bread toasted over a charcoal fire kaya coconut egg jam two soft boiled eggs and kopi grab a small bowl toss in soy sauce white pepper and get to it by buttering one slice of bread spreading kaya breaking an egg splashing soy and one bite of that delicious chewy bread rich yolk sweet kaya and the nice bit of salt from the soy sauce and tingly white pepper and you know your day is going to be okay a few sips of the kopi and all is good i have been to a few other locations but this is my favorite not to mention that there is a fabulous mutton puff shop two doors down that makes a crazy good mutton curry puff,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,long time visitor one of my favorite breakfast place in singapore i have tried the kaya toast nasi lemak curry chicken and mee laksa never disappointed loving the white coffee too come early in the morning they open from am it gets busier around ish,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,a favorite haunt of mine it is great for ol fashioned breakfast after a night of clubbing or an intense mahjong session i have been coming here since my secondary school days just to hang out with friends when i get sick of starbucks and the like and need some good ol kaya toast with soft boiled eggs never really liked their laksa but the chee cheong fun here is pretty decent as well should you not feel like kaya toast the prices here are cheap and service is quick i also enjoy the random meetings that occur here with friends i have not seen for a while,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,nice kopi even better kaya toasts one thing that grabs your attention is the many humorously pessimistic excerpts on marriage stuck on the walls,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,great little clinic looking killiney joint with zero ambience to get your daily kopi jolt and observe the kaleidoscope of humanity around you all enjoying the same,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,this is the original killiney kopitiam as in the very first one indeed you get a real sense of nostalgia when you step in and sit and the old school marble kopitiam tables you know they have been there a long time not the sort that people buy at furniture stores for the vintage look the curry chicken and mee rebus here are famous and for good reason the curry chicken is one of the best if not the best i have tried in singapore it is super thick and aromatic and the chicken and potatoes are cooked just right you can really taste the fresh spices and coconut that have gone into making that delicious gravy it also has a real kick of spiciness not like the lousy curries you get in food courts that are oily and one note if i were to nitpick i would say that sometimes the chicken has that faint chickeny taste you get when the chicken used is not super fresh,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,this popular old establishment in singapore is a great place for morning breakfast when we arrived at this restaurant it was crowded with locals the menu is quite extensive we ordered kaya toast soft boiled eggs and nasi lemak for breakfast which was delicious great to go with a cup of teh tarik price wise cheap and cheerful,Positive
killiney-kopitiam,due to it is location very basic sg breakfast fare is being sold at an inflated price the kaya toast tea is only average would not come here unless desperate because there is a chain outlet for kaya toast just slightly down the road at the main shopping area which is air conditioned,Negative
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,xiao long bao in my opinion better than din tai fung and cheaper  for   the xlb are tasty and soupy made fresh in front of you and served steaming hot i appreciate the simplicity of the ingredients yet the complexity of the flavors such a simple dish but so tasty i will definitely be back others were also ordering the szechuan dumplings or wonton which looked really good too,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,i walked into the smith street chinatown food court fully expecting the highlight to be the globally acclaimed hawker chan so you can imagine my surprise when i found they were bested by neighbor zhong guo la mian and their spicy wontons star  how were the service and atmosphere like hawker chan there is almost always a line in front of zhong guo la mian but i was pleased to find on a saturday lunch hour that the wait was less than twenty minutes once you are up front your order comes out in no more than five minutes star star  how were the portions relative to the cost  sgd for ten spicy szechuan wontons might have felt a bit more expensive than some of the other stalls but this was at the end of the day a screaming deal given these are made fresh to order essentially right in front of you star stars  and  how was the food these spicy wontons were excellent and my only regret was that i did not also order the xlb you had great filler encased in a smooth skin that really lapped up the spicy chili oil single star star  would you be excited to go back definitely star,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,been to this restaurant three times now and love the food it is located in the lively smith street of chinatown,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,food    service    value    decor    overall    everyone wants to be a hipster and that means taking really mediocre food in dingy stalls and talking it up like it is some gift from above lets get real these are at best decent xlb for a hawker stall but even trying to compare these to dtf is absolute fake news the non xlb items are completely mediocre read ugh pass,Negative
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,all in all din tai fung still wins in my opinion as i prefer the flavor of the dtf xiao long bao filling the skin here was somewhat inconsistent and if you were not very delicate and careful it would break letting the soup leak out everything is clearly handmade fresh here though you can see them hard at work in the hawker stall kitchen making each dumpling one by one and steaming the baskets of course these are not as aesthetically pleasing as dtf but if you are looking for soupy dumplings at an affordable price then this is the place for you we also ordered one bowl of beef noodle soup one plate of pan fried dumpling one plate of boiled dumplings and one plate of szechuan spicy wonton for a group of six the total was just s pp the beef noodle soup was very delicious and i would definitely order that on its own again the pan fried and boiled dumplings were excellent as well the pan fried is probably more unique and requires more effort to cook also more unhealthy the szechuan wonton is a unique flavor of vinegar and spicy oil and it is not for everyone it might be an acquired taste but none of us foreigners were really a big fan of the szechuan spiciness with vinegar,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,in terms of hawker xlb this would be one of the good ones i still think the soup should be more oily and sticky the skin is correct i suppose so far din tai fung will be the most authentic although a bit too clean in flavor for the price i think you get your money is worth  for,Negative
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,kreta ayer market is just a labyrinth on the second floor chocked full of food gems to be discovered one such example zhong guo la mian xiao long bao as in the namesake you should get an order of the xiao long baos at  for  they are a good deal and while a little less refined than the ones from din tai fung these feel more homely and very satisfying the soup dumplings are really juicy and the broth has good flavor they often make the dumplings to order so there might a be a little wait as they prepare the dumplings and place them right into the steamer it is totally worth it though,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,best xlb in singapore is found at zhong guo la mian xiao long bao in chinatown  the steamed mini buns basically pork dumplings but the fat from pork melts out of the meat into the bun and is kinda soupy in the buns oh my god so good illeatforyou xlb,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,the only place i have ever tried xlb was at din tai fung in seattle even though others love it i never thought it was that good and just assumed xlb was supposed to be that way my views on xlb changed after going to zhong guo la mian for about   usd you get  amazingly juicy and perfectly steamed xlb that packs so much amazing flavor that you will crave for months if i can find a way back to singapore this spot is a must stop,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,wildly delicious and exceptionally convenient xlbs will be the end of me i will move into the chinatown complex and find refuge with zhong guo la mian xiao long bao there is something uniquely satisfying about eating dumplings prepared before your eyes it is nostalgic a taste of innocence one bite and they will have you they will own your time and your wallet while i am reluctant to admit this kind of uncouth behavior i can devour  dumplings in one sitting,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,it is not bad but i dont think it is gonna win any awards soon i ordered the szechuan spicy noodles and pan fried dumplings you cant order half portion for the dumplings so it is all or nothing the dumplings are good but i have had better but for hawker centre standards   the noodles has a peanut sauce base but it was lacking in dimensions about   not a big fan but it was decent i was just too lazy to queue for the other award winning stalls i will come back to try their xiao long bao next time,Negative
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,good solid xlb that can satisfy any craving with the additional delight of having paid just   for  dumplings found this on yelp and no regrets about trying it i am a huge xlb fan used to go to the crystal jade steamboat and xlb buffet for both the steamboat and the free flow xlb i have just returned from taipei where i tried the original din tai fung my conclusion this is comparable with dtf quality xlb in singapore for a better price point the skin is paper thin without being overly soft or breakable and the soup folded inside the dumplings is tasty and steaming hot we thought that the filling is more generous than dtf or other places in general and the dumpling are similar sized and similar tasting the dumplings are also made to order which means you have to line up for a longer time as you wait for it to steam or pan fry if you order guo tie but so very worth it obviously it is in a hawker center so the atmosphere is nothing special to speak of but it is great for a no frills meal it makes me sad to think that something so simple and so good and so cheap cannot be found easily in the us p s i gotta try this good beer company everyone is mentioning p p p s the store is   for those struggling to find it as i did it is near the edge of the complex and across from hong kong soy sauce chicken store of michelin fame,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,this place does different types of dumplings and some noodles as well i sampled the dumplings and they are pretty decent not that they are amazing in any way but the pan fried dumplings are good and  for   sgd is a good deal the line was not long when i was there but there was a constant flow of people going here and for the price it would be a place i could consider returning to,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,i have eaten at this establishment a few times now and usually i just walk up to the counter and order a batch of freshly made xiao long baos but today was a good  minutes wait not that i am complaining it was totally worth it the wait actually allowed me to watch how the guy makes his tasty little packets of love so i am not a big fan of xlb that are very soupy i know i know do not lynch me it is just my preference and do not get me started on those tang baos but do not get me wrong the meat filling is not dry by any means i find them to be full of balanced flavor between pork and flour skin for a little variety try them in different combination of sauces soy or vinegar only and mixed and with without ginger try with ketchup ok just kidding the other nice thing is the reasonable price of    pieces come on great taste for a great price go give this place a try,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,we had to come here twice because the first time they were not open it was pm so make sure to not come then the second time we came at pm and they were open for business i ordered the xlb and spicy pork dumplings both were super delicious the couple owners were so nice and helpful too they made me feel very welcomed at their food stand,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,i cheer for the underdogs well  of the time only because  seriously should stay that way i typically spit at the favored ones well nearly  of the time because they tend to get over hyped to the point that making small mistakes become so unforgivable after all the endless banter causes your brain to think they are perfect because of how they are marketed right this probably explains my utter distaste towards din tai feng especially the two overcrowded spots in la that supposedly has the best dumplings in the freaking area do not get me wrong they are decent quite good at best but nothing mind blowing so when people keep saying that din tai feng is the only to go spot for good dumplings bile begins to form in my mouth fast forward to zhong guo la mian xiao long bao you will find two very friendly and hardworking prcs wanted to say chinese guys but changed it prc to purposely address the current stereotype and say these guys are freaking awesome they should be culinary ambassadors kneading dough and forming xiao long baos hereafter xlbs one after the other with their magical fingers they do not even need to boast awesomeness and screw themselves up with a swollen reputation because witnessing them furiously at work to keep up with the line is enough indication that they are now one of two main reasons for visiting chinatown complex the other being the good beer company and having their xlb on several occasions after cindy q introduced it to our little gathering i can safely say that  for  xlbs that taste great and pairs well with strong beers is woohoo as good as it gets definitely recommendnote i have had it  times so far   each time and the best time is usually dinner after a long line why i went at lunch and my  xlbs came from the chiller and the dough was a bit dry and chewy compared to the ones i have had during dinner where it goes straight to the steamer freshly made yelp,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,ya if they were open so disappointing that i had to settle for hawker chan but it should be a good alternative yelp did not show that this is closed though hope to try it again soon but for now is  star,Negative
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,i can confirm the other reviews are accurate great dumplings cheap worth a trip,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,for  whether it be xiao long bao guo tie boiled dumplings or steamed ones i was meeting jireh h and amanda l for a drink at good beer company i was early and craving dumplings decided to walkabout to survey the offerings started seeing many tables had big bamboo steamers on them finally found the dumpling shop run by  cheery china guys i started with an order of boiled dumplings once the others took a taste they started really getting into it we ended up ordering a few more lots of xiao long baos and an order of guo tie the xiao long bao has a certain sweetness to it i think it is chinese wine these and the pot stickers guo tie seemed to be the most popular ones when we were waiting for our orders i prefer the xiao long bao and boiled dumplings to the pot stickers as i find the stickers a bit heavy because of the oil from frying the dumplings are already quite resplendent with meat juices inside people were ordering dumplings to takeaway in multiple boxes i give  stars not because these are the best i have ever had but they are very yummy with a bit of a unique taste and well worth the price there is also not much of a wait despite them being made up on the spot you can see the guys rolling the dough and filling them while waiting free entertainment,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,after an hour into waiting in line for one of two michelin star food stalls hong kong soya sauce chicken rice noodle we decided to pick up some soup dumplings to tie us over the dumplings were fresh they actually make them in front of you juicy and the skin wrapper was delicate and thin these were better than any that i have had at din tai fung or any other soup dumpling restaurant and it was only  for  definitely worth checking out while you are in chinatown,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,omg i cannot believe i found this place amongst all the food stands in chinatown complex we went to chinatown complex looking for the good beer company but since it was dinner time thought it would be great to get some food too especially because we were in a gigantic food court after walking around the food court for  mins i found this little shop selling xiao long bao the couple at the shop were hand making them as you order they were selling them at  xlbs for   singaporean dollars incredible i ordered  to share with the hubby we finish them in  mins and went back to get  more they were delicious and much cheaper than restaurants like din tai fung etc totally recommend going there if traveling in singapore,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,thank you yelp for helping me find this place as trying to locate a stall inside the overwhelming chinatown complex hawker center can be a daunting task this place does not disappoint i had  steamed xlb which costed me   sgd   usd as i slurped each of the delicate and succulent xlbs i was pleasantly surprised to find that the broth has a sweet umami flavor the skin was tender but strong enough to keep all the fillings in without breaking when i picked up the xlbs with my chopsticks many reviewers have compared this place is dumpling to dtf an unfair comparison given that dtf is a huge global franchise in my opinion this place is way better than dtf i would not hesitate to come back again and again,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,best xiao long bao i have ever had by a good margin more homestyle than din tai fung the dumpling skins were slightly softer and more glutinous and the soup was very flavorful the pan fried dumplings and shanghai spicy noodles were also fantastic an excellent meal for two for  sgd pair with some tiger beer for an over the moon street food experience loved it loved it loved it,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,this is my new favorite food stall at the chinatown smith street hawker center excellent dumplings cheap only   for  the xiao long bao are great but you have to try the potstickers they take a little longer to fry up but definitely worth the wait the spicy dumplings are a close second the hawkers are really friendly and never turn anyone away when they are trying to close although once the sign goes off you will only get xiao long bao i have noticed that there are a lot more fellow ang moh in the queue with me lately probably no coincidence that so many reviews start with i was going to good beer company and,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,for  awesome xiao long bao one lunch my colleagues and i descended on the stall like a horde of locusts ordering over a  of the xiao long bao along with wontons pan fried dumplings and la mian every dish was tasty and consistent in quality while the xiao long bao may not be as thin skinned as the best restaurant dumplings they are my favorite on this island especially given their incredible value for money,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,the xiaolong baos were better than i would have thought the soup was sweet and delicate and it was just pretty delicious the boiled dumplings were pretty decent as well with loads of chives but not as good as the xiaolong baos i have to try the potstickers next time,Positive
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,best xlbs in all of singapore do not waste your money anywhere else especially not din tan fung they go down perfectly with some good beer company beer and for  for  how could you go wrong still unbelievable how they have not changed their prices in two years and how you still only wait  minutes for  xlbs,Negative
zhong-guo-la-mian-xiao-long-bao,went for dinner and found this stand on the second floor of the chinatown complex i was on a mission to find this stall along with the good beer company and it was a sucess i ordered  steamed mini buns for   and the uncle there was busy hand making them mine were premade as they were not busy when i stopped by so they already had some waiting but they did taste very fresh i ate them both with and without the ginger vinegar dip and actually preferred them without the vinegar they were already very juicy,Positive
odette,odette is an absolute experience while we were here for the formula  race we actually may have been just as excited to eat at odette there were a number of fantastic dishes we had during our meal but the ones that stood out to me was the soft boiled egg dish and the quail presentation i absolutely love the location of the restaurant and the decor the ceiling was beautiful service was delightful and i loved being able to peer into the kitchen getting a reservation is definitely a challenge here so if you know you are going to be in singapore immediately start hunting down the date for when reservations are released i would definitely love to come back here if we are ever in singapore again,Positive
odette,after my meal at odette i am convinced that the michelin inspectors in singapore are far too generous with their stars  michelin stars laughable noma and n naka are both  stars and those meals were exceedingly more impressive and memorable odette simply is not even in the same league we are talking about a french restaurant being ranked as the best restaurant in asia by an organization that has gotten some well deserved flack for its award categories i mean can everyone see what is wrong with that statement but hey i was curious to try it so before my holiday i booked a lunch reservation here and off we went the foodwe had another michelin meal at labyrinth scheduled for dinner that same day so we wanted to do a lighter lunch at odette we ended up going with the  course menu which was plenty as the courses were punctuated with additional courses i also decided to try the truffle egg as an additional add on amuse bouche consisted of  small bites out of which only the cheese stick came across as unique if a little under seasoned not the strongest start to our meal bread the temperature was pleasantly warm who likes eating cold bread right and the spread and dip made for good pairings the truffle bread was especially good mushroom tea served with bread this was perhaps the only course i felt like was genuinely delicious the tea was savory and offered crunchy bits of textural contrast truffle egg just pass on this if you have had black truffles then you have surely already had this disappointing experience very underwhelming and overpriced for what you get the normal non truffled egg course was superior in my opinion chicken what a boring protein choice and it tasted that way too everything about this dish from the sauce to the vegetable medley to the texture and flavor of the chicken were totally forgettable the only thing that was even sort of exciting was the side of flavored rice crab covered in a gel layer this dish was probably the most obvious display of their use of molecular gastronomy the entire thing looked like an alien swimming through space finished with microgreen accents in terms of taste and temperature it was not that exciting desserts lunch ended with several of these including a stack of petit fours of which the lollipops were the most interesting and the caneles were the least the servicepacing was fine for a  course meal and i never had to ask for a water refill the experiencea couple things  for a  star restaurant i was really surprised and honestly pretty irritated about the lack of attention to detail when it came to our check i understand that this is singapore and what is more it is a french restaurant in singapore and so there may be certain traditional cultural expectations that the man pays the bill however this is  and making that kind of assumption when you place the check down on the table is not as safe as it once was in the s oh my gosh a woman paying how unthinkable now the reasonable expectation for a restaurant of this supposed caliber should be to take notice of a who put the card down and b what the name on the card is which should not matter if they would pay attention to the former when the card was returned to us it went straight back to my male dining partner instead of to me when i am the one who paid what a bunch of crap seriously this is one of my biggest pet peeves especially at michelin restaurants just put the goddamn check in the middle of the table and return it to the person who actually paid  no keepsake perhaps it was just because we had the  course lunch menu but i have become accustomed to receiving some kind of keepsake menu or takeaway treat after a meal like this i have gotten keepsakes at michelin restaurants that cost less you have got  michelin stars step up your experience game overallfrom the outside odette looks modern and airy and pretty with its pale pinks and gold accents and white tablecloths which by the way i thought they would at least do away with considering how modern they are but i suppose that particular french tradition will continue to live on here maybe for grandma odette but food wise it was slightly underwhelming and experience wise it did not feel like they were at the top of their game best restaurant in asia methinks not,Negative
odette,odette is located inside the singapore national gallery so it is kind of cool to be there after hours at night there are a few other restaurants around it as well though i would not usually go for a french menu in an asian country i had read good things about odette so we decided to come here reservations are accepted  days in advance online so if you want a friday or saturday dinner you should plan ahead we did dinner on a friday night the menu comes as  acts for  sgd about  usd which is not that outrageous if you look at the price for  michelin star places in sf and ny these days they also have a shorter lunch option available canaps tartlet with white chocolate and px vinegar gougeres a unique long shape with tomato sweet shrimp with cumin herbs and avocado on a crisp amuse mushroom tea cep sabayon winter buckwheat and walnuts mushroom tea cep mushroom brioche with truffle butter bread service with salted whipped butter with buckwheat and extra virgin olive oil from catalonia baguette sourdough truffle brioche there are  menu options vegetarian and non vegetarian due to some dietary restrictions they were nice enough to let me mix and match a bit a promenade a singapore herbs and vegetables from local farms with japanese kombu and tomatoes b caviar and uni toast regular menu a charred avocado with pear and celery vadouvan apple sorbet b japanese mackerel with horseradish snow and tapioca cracker  heirloom beetroot variation with stracciatella pomegranate seeds and honey the beets included smoked beetroot beet sorbet beet meringue this was a very unique beet dish with lots of flavors and textures  rosemary smoked organic egg soft cooked egg with smoked potato and iberico chorizo brown butter foam this is their signature dish and was probably my favorite for the night a variations of cabbage with romanesco and black truffle b foie gras and abalone with bbq pork puff pickled shiitake  bbq kinki japanese fish with rutabaga puree prawn mousse grilled squid saffron sauce dill oil a red kuri squash agnolotti with parmigiano reggiano and black grilled mushrooms i think my pasta dish was the winner of the two optionsb charred smoked pigeon from brittany with a confit and bbq leg deep fried heart liver in a tart the pigeon was very unique ad presented beautifully but was too gamey and strong for me  cheese cart beautiful cart good selection  sgd supplement pre dessert grapefruit sorbet with mint foam blood orange green tea  yuzu tart with shiso and basil yuzu sorbet yuzu foam i love yuzu so this was perfect for me it was a nice light dessert petit fours lychee and rose lollipop caneles my favorite musk melon mini chocolate tart they send you home with a cute jar of house jam which is a nice touch service was on point fresh napkins each time you get up coordinated setting of dishes etc though i would expect no less for  stars overall everything was solid and it was a great special occasion meal but nothing was super innovative or particularly standout for us,Positive
odette,best restaurant in asia is a title which carries a lot of weight lunch at odette was certainly very good but maybe my expectations were too high my friend and i had the  course lunch we were lucky enough to be able to book around  weeks in advance the reservation process was pleasant they ask for a deposit and a confirmation i was a bit confused why they asked for another confirmation once seemed enough for me especially considering the cancellation policy of taking your deposit if you are a no show nevertheless service wise i have nothing to complain all staff was extremely attentive and friendly despite the fact that the restaurant was filled with fellow chefs and food critics we were there during the world is best  event foodwise it was also excellent i felt like all dishes had a clear focus was extremely balanced and highlighted the ingredients my faves were definitely the rosemary smoked egg and the red mullet especially the smoked egg with the potato tasted like my favorite comfort food mash with a soft boiled egg elevated to michelin status so overall great food and excellent service so why no five stars i do not think it compares with the former greatness of andre i think odette does classics to perfection but lacks innovation if i read some of the older reviews i have noticed that the dishes stayed more or less the same over the years a restaurant in this league should lead innovation but hey if mr michelin and mr world is best  disagree with me i might be wrong or maybe it is personal preference i will definitely want to go and try the dinner offer and see if they can convince me to add that th yelp star,Positive
odette,while vacationing in singapore we dined at this fantastic restaurant supposedly no  restaurat in asia and it was recently awarded  star michelin so far it is the best restaurant we have been so far the food service location inside a museum ambiance was what you expect at  star michelin and the  restaurant in asia just awesome highly recommended it will cost you this is not for budget conscious foodie,Positive
odette,oddette is probably in the top  best meals i have had in my life i want to say top  with tickets and akelarre as some other meals in that tier for me i felt like the value of ambiance service and food was fairly matched by the cost of the meal we went on a weekend so they only offered  course or  course for lunch and originally we wanted to do the  course they offer for lunch on weekdays but it is hard to get a reservation here so we took whatever they could offer if you want to try this restaurant on a budget go for lunch on a weekday and they will serve a s   course menu caution though when you are budgeting for this meal it is both on a financial and time dimension this certainly is not your one hour lunch and not even your  hour lunch it took us  and a half hours when they say  courses what they mean is like  real dishes and they do not include the transitioning dishes that help cleanse your palate which many restaurants would include as part of the tasting menu overall i think i counted around  dishes dish after dish combined the freshest and highest quality ingredients with beautiful execution the ingredients were from a vast array of cuisines including uni pigeon foie gras caviar truffle scallop shiitake and so much more one note that i have to make is if you set yourself a budget for this meal when they ask if you would like some cheese either a homemade truffle cheese or a cheese tasting it is going to be extra and they do not warn you about it it costs s  extra for the cheese was it worth it we got to taste a lot of different kinds of cheese both in taste and texture however there were maybe only one cheese we really liked ossau iraty so probably not worth the cost all dishes were amazing my favorites would be the hokkaido uni and toast abalone with foie gras rosemary smoked egg and some of the amuse bouche i do not want to ruin any surprises but just sit back and enjoy the composition,Positive
odette,odette was a fantastic meal with impeccable service in a wonderful environment each course was evidently well thought through with the beetroot pidgeon and mushroom soup as highlights some of the courses did not quite hit the spot the seaweed cured kinmedai was a bit whatever the yuzu tart was slightly underwhelming the presentation of each though was imaginative and well thought through love was put into every dish overall though we left as very happy diners  is a steep price point incl  glasses wine but odette is a fantastic experience worth splashing out for,Positive
odette,yes it is a  star in yelp for a  star restaurant service food ambience and overall experience is comparable to what we paid for we can see the difference between osteria francescana vs odette especially in its service and creativity otherwise all good,Positive
odette,odette national gallery singapore michelin starsfrench cuisine by chef julien royer my  course set lunch amuse bouche conte cheese sponge cake with vinegar walnut shavings like a damp bread do not like itchar pillow filled with aubergine filling very nice although i am not an aubergine fanpeas blah blah okaymushroom with sauvignon and wild mushroom tea poured on top with a bread that is more the texture of croissant very nicexl mozambique langoustine langoustine is texture was goodrosemary smoked organic egg very nice display but egg was not so hotquercy lamb saddle nicelemon tart very nicelovely lunch not just because it has the stars but it was very good,Positive
odette,during our recent trip to singapore we had an opportunity to dine at odette and was the best dining experience for us in singapore the service was impeccable the flavor taste and freshness of all the ingredients were perfect we look forward to trying their other seasonal menu when we return back to singapore next time,Positive
odette,this is the very best of singapore dining odette is artful delicious with near perfect service a truly great setting it sits in an elegant ground floor corner of the national gallery singapore should be very proud of this restaurant the restaurant is controlled by the capable hands of the french fine diners know that singapore needs to remove its truly incapable hand from restaurant service when i ask my singaporean friends why they encourage and support such poor service i am told that they do not see being a waiter as a profession well take a closer look it is a demonstration of a lack of pride and poor taste singapore odette stands out as a first class restaurant the  or so courses are all very well executed and if you can afford the price and can wait out the extended calendar for a reservation you must experience this elegant dining,Positive
odette,came her for the last meal of our honeymoon and it was a fantastic experience the food was excellent the only dish on our tasting menu that i did not really get into was the foi pho but i do understand how that could be a more palatable presentation for the locals the staff was extremely friendly which is why we ended up being the last ones out of there at the ended of the night the only thing i thought was a little weird was how far it is to the restroom there is probably not much they can do about that,Negative
odette,deservedly a  star great ambience and great wine pairing lunch experience definitely try the  course menu,Positive
odette,there are just so many things to appreciate about a restaurant like this and how julien royer operates his kitchen whether it was his directive or his investors his strictly local talent is incredible and the imagination is showcased in the dishes is beautiful you can tell every chef and employee works hard yet loves what they do with all of their smiles there is no pretentiousness like i am noticing after the stars have been awarded like in other restaurants where there once was no such thing e q corner house i agree with nik t that odette was always in the shadows of the more adventurous and experimental andre but now that the latter has closed its doors odette truly shines above all other singapore michelin stars the dishes are beautiful and full of flavor as well as many courses with the bells and whistles of dry ice and smoke the ambiance is comfortable but the staff quickly makes you feel at home very conversational and full of knowledge and warmth although this is a typical long tasting menu dinner if there was any in singapore to spend on that is uniquely singapore definitely do odette,Positive
odette,excellent menu exhibiting creativity flavours beautiful plating and mastering of techniques the only bmol is certain dishes could have been served slightly warmer not overly long but diverse and very good wine list mainly french one of the best service staff in singapore friendly knowledgeable and pro active in my opinion the best french restaurant in singapore more daring and passionate yet less pretentious than its leading competitors,Positive
odette,not quite five stars but a solid four my benchmark for fine dining in sg will always be andre and unfortunately julien has yet to step out of his shadow their space at the national gallery is a class act but not anywhere as panoramic as jaan still you will impress your date if you bring one their delightfully friendly and accommodating service team will further ensure you and yours are well taken care of the pacing of the tasting menu was fine with enough time to take that perfect food porn and with free wifi enabling you to upload instantly to yelp as for the food some dishes the egg the cepe tea and the dessert were just too similar to jaan nothing necessarily wrong but just a tad bit boring for my picky palate the artisan bread selection with unsalted butter prosciutto and lard spread will stave off any hunger pangs and increase serotonin to such levels leading to happiness the heirloom beetroot variation was a standout dish for me i might well turn vegetarian if all non meat dishes taste as such beautiful to both eye and mouth the seafood dishes were also noteworthy fresh simple ingredients assembled with complexity desserts whilst satiating were nothing mind blowing so maybe i will try their cheese supplement next time now lo and behold this is something that grandma odette can be proud of,Positive
odette,this restaurant deservingly earned its michelin star the six course menu was creative inviting and delicious it also busted my belly i do not know how people can take down the  course set as with most fine dining do not come here within a budget order with your stomach and not the wallet my one criticism is that there is no dress code a table of grown men came in with backpacks sneakers and shirts which betrays the spirit of fine dining i might be a snob so whatever deal with it,Negative
odette,odette is the latest hyped restaurant in singapore and for our wedding anniversary seemed to be a befitting location to celebrate by indulging dinner menus are priced  and  for  or  courses respectively note that the  course dinner is not available from friday and saturday vegetarian menus are available too we took both the normal menus to try upon seating we were asked which type of water we would like still or sparkling  person free flow seemed reasonable tap is available for free though first up were canaps  bite sized delights all quite tasty sorry cannot remember the details followed by amuse bouche of mushroom tea this was good full of umami though that a half piece of brioche as a chaser was unnecessary in my view then the bread platter arrived a piece of tree bark was used in place of a plate presentation was great  different types of bread were served chia seed focaccia was our favorite but the sourdough wedge was lovely too the thyme brioche was the weakest link the flavor was not intense enough to make any impact two different butters were served salted lardo yes it is piggy fat and unsalted butter then the meal was served proper i sha not go into details of each plate but they were all well presented and tasty but i would not say it is overwhelming impressive especially if they are aiming for the michelin star service was choppy my glass of water was empty for a good while before it was noticed and topped up most of the servers are foreigners and cannot enunciate their words properly dinner ended with petit fours the lemon meringue lollipop was the most interesting and best of the lot canele was a close second though a good experience overall but i wo not be in a hurry to come back maybe for the less pricy lunch but not otherwise,Negative
odette,went there in mid aug for a friend is birthday celebration so this review is rather late but i have been missing their food ever since and am planning to go there again there are many great restaurants in singapore but very few are delivering an innovative degustation menu like odette we had the six courses tasting menu fell in love with the rosemary smoked organic egg immediately when we saw the presentation experimental and full of surprises the service is impeccable and the ambience makes people feel relaxed and calm so i say definitely go try it out and you will not regret,Positive
odette,odette has probably been the most talked about restaurant in town for the last few months the limited number of tables available and the fairly egalitarian reservation policy is a big factor though some would say julien is the biggest pull and who does not want to see the insides of the supreme court anyway the wait time for a table on the weekend now stands at about   months though cancellations do happen so i recommend calling up the hostess to leave your number fine dining restaurants usually have a money table and another for last minute special people but this does not exist at odette which i found out after several people came back to me empty handed so was it worth the wait i think the restaurant has a lot of potential and i thoroughly enjoyed my lunch but i did not walk away with my mind blown so the answer is i guess so there are clear signs of greatness in the attention to detail in plating picturesque dishes the variety of flavors and textures and some theatrical sauce pouring and smoke the price point is incredible value as well at  for  creative courses plus i love the design of the restaurant it makes one feel calm uncluttered and chic i liked my amuse bouche pork belly and bread do not laugh the restaurants that ace bread making tend to make great food too but i was also bored by the play it safe ingredient list truffles in every other fish check pork belly check foie gras check given how well the dishes were executed why not be adventurous with the produce i have heard the french are as nose to tail happy as chinese to some degree after all there lies the problem i suppose i did not think any dish was bad but i did not find anything so unique or memorable that i could recall its name or contents a week later yes i was with a work related acquaintance and so my mind was not  focused on the food but i tried per se in a similar context and could still remember the piece of srf slow cooked beef i had that melted in my mouth the famous pearls and the insane ending line up of desserts i will end by saying that i am still tempted to return to try the dinner degustation because the chefs could have been limited by the affordable price point required at lunchtime in a way i think the food at odette is like a straight a student at the psle exams schooled in good techniques and scoring points but needs to use that to express some real creativity and risk to achieve greatness let is see what happens,Negative
odette,odette is a place that challenges your imagination of what food ought to be full disclaimer i am not an adventurous eater so therefore i found the meal satisfying but challenging it is a  course gastronomy which takes you to tastes of a wide range the service is awesome and the crew does care about each guest is preference and request the wine list is extensive even champagne by the glass has  choices the ambience is fittingly perfect to a national gallery and kudos to the gov of thinking so far perfect place for celebrating an occasion and if you have not been it is definitely worth to go,Positive
odette,super restaurant deserving the  michelin stars perhaps even the third one may be on its way have one table in the kitchen itself and if you want to closely observe and almost be part of the creation please try to request that when you first seat down you are offered several excellent different champagnes please be aware that these are not complimentary,Negative
odette,my first time at the national gallery and my first time trying julien royer is food i think i would recommend it to anyone looking for a high end meal my wife and i tried the  and  course meals surprisingly not that different we walked in without a reservation so it is not one of those places you have to book weeks in advance food was  out of  stars service was  out of  stars i imagine this place will be a  star when michelin comes to town i would come back here for a special occasion,Positive
hai-di-lao,wow oh wow i highly recommend this place the food is good but the service here is something to come for alone in their waiting area you can get your nails done free of charge play area for the kids computer for use and a few other things to keep yourself entertained after we were seated at our table we had an ipad that we can order our food we got aprons to keep our clothes clean from the hot pot and i got a hair tie to keep my hair up from getting in the way after we were served our food our server comes and help to cook our food at our table we ordered the hand pulled noodles so someone came to our table to do it right at our table it was pretty cool there is a sauce bar with a wide selection of ingredients to make our own sauces we made our own but server came by and prepared one of their signature dipping sauce for us as well it was perfect it great with everything such as the meat veggies and seafood i loved everything about this place that is some great service we are not accustomed to this type service at a shabu shabu restaurant most are usually laid back and self service on most things after raving about this restaurant to a few friends i found out that this place is a chain so when i travel i can have this same experience i cannot wait until i can go back,Positive
hai-di-lao,famous chinese hotpot chain usually super long line so would recommend making a reservation good service they offer you ziploc bags to put your phone aprons hair ties for the ladies phone charger and games snacks juices if you are waiting for your table food wise a pretty good selection of soup bases though the meat choice was a bit limited overall a pretty good experience though personally prefer beauty in the pot which has more interesting meat seafood selection and slightly less spicy mala soup the latter is personal preference o sauces and desserts are free buffet styleo would recommend as a meet up spot for a large group,Positive
hai-di-lao,first restaurant after landing in singapore as a good friend recommended first thoughts wow it is so clean we ordered a whole bunch of food including their signature beef and chose chicken soup and spicy sichuan soup as the soup bases food was   and the service we received was   even gave us free deep fried mochi like w honey dessert after finding out that we were on our honeymoon thank you for giving us a great experience,Positive
hai-di-lao,this place was very good it is unfortunate that it is not all you can eat because this is a big selling point to me since many other hot pot places i go to are all you can eat they had a variety of meats and veggies but if you like to have a variety of dishes to try like me i think you will find this place a bit pricey they had your typical meats mushrooms and green vegetables to offer but what stood out to me was the hand pulled noodles that you can order and someone will come out to make them for you right before your eyes it is very entertaining and worth the cost in my opinion this was honestly a normal hot pot place like any other one i have been too but what stood out to me the most and the reason i am giving this  stars is because of the service the service was go good and made my experience complete and positive our waitress was so friendly and would constantly check up on us to see if we needed anything our drinks would get refilled without question throughout the night at no additional cost we each received an apron to not dirty our clothes and i received a hair tie to hold my hair back from the soup we got plastic bags to put our phones in so they do not get dirty quick service we got the food so fast make reservations to be seated quicker but if you choose to wait they give you snacks and manicures they even have a day care area so the kids can play,Positive
hai-di-lao,oh my goodness what a total food experience to be had at this restaurant i do not have any back ground on these hot pots but it was really a very modern take on the old traditional steam boat i think as first timers to this way of cooking at the table our dedicated staff member was amazingly supportive and helpful aprons were supplied along with many hot hand towels as we put together our soups a noodle making demonstration at our table was novel entertainment the evening was extremely enjoyable especially as we shared the room with some australians who also had never been there before ipads took our orders with the help of the staff we just loved the whole evening,Positive
hai-di-lao,fun experience and great fun locationgood selection of meats and brothscool experience and great servicecons famous spicy and other broths too salty and not that awesomemeat cuts are simple american meatsprices high even by singapore standardsfun to try once but not something worth becoming regular over,Positive
hai-di-lao,i have long accepted that good service in singapore is an afterthought at best but hai di lao hot pot has restored my faith that some businesses truly do put the customer first it is pricier than the average hotpot but the service is truly just on point they are supper attentive and the commitment to the smallest of details is truly remarkable anything from little plastic covers for your phone to remembering which tea you were drinking my favorite example of the night was when they offered to tame the spice of our mala broth after they happened to walk by and heard an off the cuff comment from me about my numb lips great little side dishes while you wait plus a plethora of options to make your own dipping sauce if in doubt feel free to ask the staff to make the house sauce for you it is really quite yummy definitely order the handmade mashed shrimp and the house dancing noodles are quite entertaining yes a guy comes around to make fresh noodles as he dances and twirls the dough over your heads did not really order the premium meats and did not notice the difference everything was fresh also really like the wintermelon tea that was just the right amount of sweet we had the latest reservation possible at pm and were seated promptly the lines started to build after but there are drinks snacks games and even manicures to pass the time pricy but i was blown away by the charming and attentive service,Positive
hai-di-lao,this place is amazing you get free snacks ice cream and even your nails done while you are waiting for a table the food here is a bit pricey but totally worth it it tastes really good and the service is excellent it is extremely family friendly and your kids even end up getting toys bathrooms are very clean and nice the waitresses are very courteous and helpful the tables have phone charges in them they even have people perform every now and then to entertain the guests pro tip opt in for the liquid buffet and the sauce dessert buffet they are absolutely worth it adds about  p p to your bill,Positive
hai-di-lao,the wait is long   hours and we called ahead and she said they were not busy however the broths are excellent and the food is excellent while waiting there is a ton of people and uncomfortable stools to sit on they have snacks like popcorn tomatoes and various other goodies i signed up for a manicure but we were eating when they were ready for me so i skipped it for the food the pork and corn balls were excellent as were the dumplings everything else was very good but what i expect at hot pot the sauce bar is nice and is  person for two we spent  s since we wanted to try many broths it was s  for those,Positive
hai-di-lao,oh gosh this is my most favourite hangout for steamboat well well when i heard people rave about this hotpot located at the heart of clark quay area i was like hmmm issit really that good i went down to this venue for my birthday celebration and i was wow by the number of people queuing and waiting to be seated this place is always crowded with people and while waiting for your seat you will be served drinks fruits or nuts with no cost at all ladies pls note you can try to have your manicure done while waiting and its totally free of charge sounds good ya this place serve a wide variety range of food and its really really very fresh th service crew is very attentive and they provide you aprons to wear to avoid any spills a ziplock bag for your handphone and lastly if your handphone is low batt they provide charger too you get to place your order via the ipad and the serving is fast tooi love the sauce selection and dipping my food in the sauce i mix simply make it taste wonderful its a good place for friends gathering and the price is slightly on the high side but its worth the money and experience this place is simply deserve  stars but do note the waiting queue could be quite long,Positive
hai-di-lao,the version of hotpot or steamboat as it is called in singapore is different from our local hotpot this is their second outlet after their crazily successful first outlet at clarke quay that is not to say that the wait is any shorter here even if you call ahead to make reservation it is most likely that you would still have to wait the plus point is that the service is great especially given that they are all from china where service is questionable they also have lots of other entertainment while you wait in this outlet you get pedi mani the kids get a ball room to jump in and you also get free flow of popcorns drinks snacks and fruits on to the main course the hotpot i still prefer the steamboat at imperial treasure over this the offering is pretty much similar and the price point is actually lower than at imperial treasure but imperial treasure is a hong kong style steamboat while hdl is a china style steamboat the tastes do come across as such too it is not about one is better than the other it is more which one you prefer hdl cheaper but the taste is not as refined as imperial treasure great service staff though,Positive
hai-di-lao,it was ok nothing really remarkable about the food the sauce bar was nice and the kids enjoyed the fruit from the buffet,Positive
hai-di-lao,i would safely say that this is the best hot pot restraint to come out of china this venue is the first franchise of this mega china hotpot restaurant in singapore on a weekday during dinner time expect to wait hours to get a seat as they do not take reservations during dinner time the mala spicy sichuan pepper soup is excellent and they do not compromise on the amount of ingredients to prepare the peppery soup base their chicken soup base is made from black chickens and the rich strong taste of the chicken stock can me tasted even without adding in any ingredients the meats are extremely fresh and we will cut all i can say is this is a must try for anyone in the clarke quay area,Positive
hai-di-lao,after reading so many raving reviews i was excited to give this place a try my boyfriend and i went during non peak hours approximately  so the wait was not terrible we waited for approximately  minutes and spent our time trying to solve rubix cube and eating the snacks provided to us the menu and ordering process were simple and straightforward once i tasted the food i was let down the sauces were bland we got chicken and tomato and the prawns were slightly bitter the reason why i give the review three stars is due to the service the wait staff were attentive and the food was brought out quickly all that said i was disappointed by the underwhelming meal and the price was steep for such,Negative
hai-di-lao,i have heard so much about hai di lao so i definitely had to give this a try i tried making a reservation for dinner but it was fully booked thankfully i happen to be part of the vacation ing class of singaporeans who have nothing better to do on a monday at lunchtime than to indulge in some authentic ma la hot pot there was barely any crowd at lunch and we managed to get a table without any wait the pork belly slices were very good they were so good that they managed to con us to order a second serving in which the quality of the meat noticeably dropped the sliced pork was ok but i would recommend going for the pork belly instead the us beef slices were yummy too my only qualm with the meat slices were that they were cut slightly too thick i would have preferred it better if they were just a tad thinner the  pax cost for sauces seemed a little overpriced at first but we soon realised that it included the appetizer peanuts and post meal fruits desserts making the price seem justifiable we didnt know that the drinks were free flow at  pax we stuck to ordering water tea but being kiasu singaporeans would probably have expanded our selection if we knew it wasnt going to cost more the handmade prawn paste was interesting as the paste curled up to look like shrimps after they were cooked for  per serving you can watch a live demonstration of the chef pulling the la mian noodle and here i say that you are paying  to watch a show since i definitely wouldnt pay that money for the very average noodles the mushroom medley was delightful for mushroom lovers the ma la pot is pretty thumb numbing ly spicy you have been warned the bill came up to be about  pax which was kinda expected given all the ratings but still a tad pricey considering that we didnt order much food still i would say that it is one of the better hot pot joints around ps sharing a friend is recipe for the sauce station hoisin sauce korean chilli garlic dash of sesame oil pretty good combination i must say,Positive
hai-di-lao,still quite on the fence about how i feel about haidilao the food was good the mala chili soup was spicy without it being too tongue numbing and i would definitely recommend trying their handmade lamian their services are they definitely go all out to entertain their customers while waiting for a table they provide all sorts of entertainment ladies you can even have a few gel manicure their manicurists are skilled but not to the point of doing intrinsic designs they also give you access to their snack bar free flow of drinks and assorted fruit before you begin eating people with long hair will be offered a hair tie when you order the handmade lamian a guy will perform a sort of dance to pull the noodles the thing that irked me most was the queue even with reservations we waited for over an hour on a weekday night when we saw a free table we asked if we could sit there we were a group of  the hostess said the table was meant for groups of    minutes later she gave the table to a group of  anyway on average you can expect to wait for an hour to  hours during peak period i guess that is why they go all out to entertain their guests still too ridiculously long for me to come back maybe next time i will come back during lunch hour,Positive
hai-di-lao,waited for  hours till my hunger pangs disappeared the service here undoubtedly is impeccable however i do think it is over hyped and priced they recently introduced a takeaway option to host it in the comfort of home but i find the prices laughable a pretty negative review they have an interesting soup base tomato smth soup but the cuts of meat are not exactly worth the price of paying would rather visited the line of steamboat restaurants at bugis,Negative
hai-di-lao,i tried out this place for the first time today and cannot believe it took me this long to do so if not for the long wait i will come here more often we actually did not have to wait long because we had a reservation and got there pretty early but if you are with good company the wait might not be so bad given the free snacks drinks and manicure you can get while waiting this is my new go to spot for hot pot especially with a group the service was amazing and the staff was very attentive to our table and kept the drinks flowing and broth refilled i thought the food was of good quality and they also provide free fruits and desserts i left the place stuffed which rarely happens to me here in singapore oh make sure you get to see the noodle dance,Positive
hai-di-lao,in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth he then created man and then restaurants man began to whine about pathetic service at restaurants especially chinese restaurants so god gave man hai di lao and caused man to stfu well i am sure anyone who complains at hai di lao hot pot needs to see a psychiatrist my mind is completely blown by the extent of service perfection here a chinese restaurant of all places so perfect that even western spots and their pompous matre d are easily put to shame by these down to earth so friendly i would think they would spoon feed me if i would ask servers service their attention to detail is nuts fine fine it is uncommon rare different let me elaborate on some of them everyone gets a cloth apron not the crappy plastic ones you get at spots like boiling crab to keep your clothes clean if you happen to be a messy eater or are experimenting with chopsticks or have a leaking mouth she will even put it on for you if you agree to wear it or you can be like my cousin and i who insisted to have it on our lap instead if you wear glasses you are gifted a microfiber cloth to clean your glasses with before and after your meal or as ocd often as you wish if you have any items out on the table such as phones pocket cameras they will provide ziploc sandwich size bags for you to put them in to keep out the steam and oil unless i am chugging my tea my glass usually gets to half empty when a refill is provided staff continuously checks in at perfect time intervals to ensure that all is well even offering tips on when each ingredient should go in for maximum flavor soup base kept getting refilled without asking hey do not look at me it does not matter what liquid it is i am a freaking camel ask my cousins i treated the hot pot like an oasis staff would sift out the oil froth buildup from the soup on various intervals to keep the soup clean and healthier food my cousin had the half and half soup base one side black chicken broth is immaculate before and after cooking the other side a tomato base if you are a cioppino fan or tomato paste lover like me you will love this base for a hotpot i am so thankful she did not order burn your tongue taste nothing ma la spicy base self served seasoning bar you create your own love elixir to go with whatever is cooking i wo not spend too much time talking about the food because at   average per person as well as a focus on service and perfection the food did not fall short i really enjoyed the quality of the meats and even dipped them for  seconds to eat them on the mid raw side i must admit that i cannot get over the broth i am in love with it and i have never found myself saying that before where i enjoyed the soup base pre cooking and post cooking it was great totally epically awesome oh yeah we did not order the pulled noodle but saw from the other table that it involves a man doing the noodle dance that gets the dough to the right length and consistency before they cut it quite entertaining to see how it never touches him or the floor as he does his advanced rope twirling dance atmosphere other perks you know it is packed but it does not feel like it is the table is spacious and distanced properly to give a somewhat suburban feel that does not make you feel like a sardine you are taken care of from the moment you are in the establishment especially if you did not make a reservation there is a waiting area for children to hang out in watch tv and play various things above all things they also give free manicures w t h mind blownyelp,Positive
hai-di-lao,hai di lao hotpot if my favorite hotpot restaurant ever because of the free snacks the ambiance the servers and everything about hai di lao is fantastic the meat is great the bathrooms are great the noodles are fun to watch and all of the food is good there my only problem with this place is that they do not take reservations and you have to wait around   hours to get a table which is crazy but it is totally worth it,Positive
hai-di-lao,the quality of both the food and service at hai di lao hot pot exceed every other hot pot restaurant i have ever been to with that being said it was also by far the most expensive hot pot experience i have ever had i went out to lunch with a friend and the most memorable part of the meal was probably the hand stretched noodles they were pulled in front of our table and tasted great i would definitely recommend this place but be prepared to spend a pretty penny i spent about   as much at j pot in vivo city for about the same amount of food albeit slightly lower quality food and service,Positive
hai-di-lao,awesome introduction to how hot pot or steam boat is done in asia my previous experience have been in restaurants in the u s and it really cannot compare from the delicious make your own condiment sauce stations to the super good meet and broth itself the experience is nothing short of sensory overload warning though the spicy broth is really spicy i was lucky enough to have gone with local singaporeans so ordering was taken cared of by them service was great food fantastic complete with a dude who randomly comes up and starts dancing while twirling noodles dude was like a rhythmic gymnast other than that expect long waits unless you made a reservation ladies do not worry this location has an in house nail salon that is not a typo to help you pass the time we had a party of  and we ordered a good amount of food and beer all in the bill was roughly s  well worth it,Positive
hai-di-lao,service is definitely a  star experience here food wise i think it is so much better at imperial treasure due to time wasted waiting at the lobby having their plum tea and pop corn i believe it is worth deduction of  stars unless you do not mind waiting  hours for a steamboat,Positive
hai-di-lao,this place is legendary for its long think   hours queues to make it seem better there is a reasonably sized area for waiting outside the restaurant and you can snack on popcorn longans crackers while waiting there is also  manicurists at the entrance where you can get your nails done for free but the wait is even longer than that for the restaurant but we a group of  went at pm on a saturday without a reservation and managed to get our table in min the food was really good we had a half and half szechuan mala numbingly hot and the chicken broth both were flavorful and enjoyable the mala was really really spicy my tongue went numb as i ate whatever we would plonked into the hot pot we all had the good sense to avoid drinking the soup the chicken broth was tasty and we drank bowls of this down ordering is via an ipad app comes in both english and mandarin and is pretty straightforward an average plate of beef probably enough to serve at least  is about  even the cheapest ones were of good quality and well marinated we had the beef chicken and pork all were very good the handmade noodles were hailed as a must try basically you have this noodle master a guy coming up to you and swinging the dough around skillfully as he makes his noodles in front of your table it was very interesting to watch but i am not a big fan of noodles in hot pot so it is more of a once off for noveltys sake for me service was excellent too the servers were polite attentive and we were given ziploc bags to protect our phones microfibre cloth to wipe our glasses with hair ties to tie our hair so that they would not interfere with us eating and bibs to protect our clothes with the  of us were stuffed at the end and it was to our pleasant surprise that the bill was only  after tax per person would definitely come here again when i have the time to,Positive
hai-di-lao,very good steamboat restaurant in heart of clark quay great selection and it was very spicy which we liked staff did not speak english at least the ones who served us but it worked out as we had a chinese speaking person with us order the noodles and watch the noodle dance fascinating very long wait but we made reservation and then went across the way for a drink and waited and they then called us when ready so not too bad but they had kids play area and even a place for manicure while you wait great service and food was very good will go again,Positive
hai-di-lao,tomato soup is out of expectation thought it would be weird but surprisingly it taste pretty good chicken soup tastes bland at first but after a few cooking the soup gets better service is superb too apron and a ziplock bag for the phone is provided too,Negative
hai-di-lao,i would expect much better maybe the hot pot is more common in hong kong the quality is much better than this sgd  per head we have ordered  dishes of beef  portions of veggie  seafood platter  pieces of noodle  tofu and  tofu noodle the soup base is msg intensive the food is standard but with this price the portion should be bigger and the presentation should be better e g the seafood platter comes in a plastic plate and the  pieces of mussel  shrimps and i forgot what else all lump together service the waitresses are keen but i am not used to all the rush in putting the whole plate of raw beef into the hot pot while there are other cooked food in the pot not a good hot pot manner to mix raw and cooked food together the veggie and noodle all got overcooked when the beef is ready mmmm the dessert is also lame disappointed,Negative
hai-di-lao,i love this place for it is sichuan style hotpot i wo not cover the waiting times and what you can do while waiting because every other reviewer has mentioned them special mention is to get the gongfu noodles ask the waitress for them and the chef will come out and perform an acrobatic show using the noodles for you then you get to put it in your hotpot for consumption it is kinda like a gimmick for entertainment purposes but hey at least the noodles are good the service here is legendarily good even in their stores in china yes do not gasp it is true in no other chinese restaurant here in singapore do i find such great customer service from the staff who are friendly accommodating and gives good recommendations for your food our waitress was nice enough to let us know that we have ordered too much and told us that if it was not enough we can always order more later overall i would go back again tips are to go late in the evening around pm or later so that it is easier to get a seat you have been warned,Positive
hai-di-lao,absolutely delicious but not sure if it is worth the wait but seeing that i am a tourist i am glad i got the chance to try it as a local i am sure a friday night without reservations would not be the best time to check it out i waited over  hours but the perks for this include  free snacks popcorn banana chips watermelon slices oranges manicure bar ladies get in line to get your nails done for free  games chinese chess available iphone they will apply a screen protector on your phone for you if you would like incentives if you solve a rubik is cube or fold  origami cranes you get to choose a free plate up to the amount of  woohoo not sure if there are others but these were the ones that i was exposed to the hand stretched noodles done in front of you at the table is pretty amusing our guy kept breaking it so took  times before he was able to drop them into the broth but all good just meant a longer show for us i would say the highlight is definitely the broth get the chicken one i could drink that all night long,Positive
hai-di-lao,not a big fan of hot pot or steam boat but i am very impressed with this one superb soup stock and very fresh ingredients and meat,Positive
hai-di-lao,this place will wow anyone away with exceptional good service however the long waits for your table if you do not have a reservation can really turn off when i first read about this restaurant on a friend is facebook post i could not believe what i read amongst other wonderful service they provide like board games and snacks while you wait free manicures for ladies playroom for kids apron for dining ziplock bags for your devices it was said that they provide a baby cot for the baby to sleep and play next to your table while you dine seriously this is unheard of that a restaurant in singapore that will provide a cot for my baby to sleep in while i dine awesome i gotta check that out for myself a few days later i went with some friends to check out the place and true enough if you make your reservation and indicate that you are bring along a baby a baby cot is prepared next to your table they even have toys in the cot to entertain the baby aside from the service the food is great too love their soup base the ingredients that they use and the varied selection of the sauces the broth is flavorful and delicious and the ingredients for the hot pot are fresh do not forget to order at least an order of their la mien you also get a short performance with a wait staff doing a noodle dance that often diners would enjoy everything is perfect except the price haha it can be pretty pricey as they do not have buffet since then i am sold in going to haidilao for hotpot its an awesome dining experience and we always go home stuffed and happy remember to make your reservation else the wait can be   hours during peak hours from what i remembered for weekdays the last reservation is at  pm and for weekends the last reservation is at pm,Positive
hai-di-lao,really really good food and if you order a specific kind of noodle they will send a guy to stretch it right before your eyes the sauce buffet was also great you can pick your own sauces and mix them if you want it was a friend is birthday and they also gave her a gift in addition to bringing out the cake service was amazing really you get cloth aprons any purses bags you have are also covered with a cloth and if you wear glasses they give you a small cleaning cloth for it you also get a ziploc bag for your phone my friend made a reservation a few weeks in advance but if you do not have a reservation and are willing to wait they have a host of things for you to do while waiting from manicures to board games,Positive
hai-di-lao,an outstanding place even if you are not yet a customer my friend was smart enough to have reserved a dinner two weeks in advance or we would have had to wait hours to get a table but even if you have to wait you can enjoy some delightful perks including snacks and tea board games and even a manicure for the ladies only unfortunately the food is also excellent tasty fun and presented very well the szechuan broth was certainly ma la numb but not spicy enough to prevent you from enjoying it just be cautious of the pool of oil when you remove your food from the pot next i highly recommend ordering a set of noodles a slab of dough will be tossed into strands of deliciousness right in front of your eyes it is truly a sight to behold i would pay money just to see that happen again one of the best parts of the experience is the diy sauce station with around a dozen base ingredients to choose from you will surely be satisfied the sauce station also houses the restaurant is amazing soybean pudding dou hua i alone had  servings of it just delicious and very well textured though i never received a ziplock bag for my camera and electronics i did receive a cute apron and enjoyed wonderful service from the waiters even the notion of ordering your food on an ipad with full descriptions of most items was mind blowing what was crazy was the sight of a crib with a baby sleeping in it that was a first and quite incredible other restaurants need to learn from hdl,Positive
hai-di-lao,excellent friendly service we had a reservation and were seated promptly so we missed the nail salon and other attractions to amuse patrons waiting for a table the food was great wide choice of soup bases and large choice of meats sea food and veggies order the la mien and enjoy the noodle dance very entertaining evening with great food,Positive
hai-di-lao,the girlfriend and i visited here on a lunar new year weekend half expecting not to get a spot we were pleasantly surprised when we were promptly ushered to a spot we were most impressed by its attention to details plastic covers to shield our electronics aprons and a small quilt for clothes and handbags the waitresses were very attentive and patient attending to us at every turn food wise the basic chicken broth was tasty the ma la pot was a little too much for our palate all in all hai di lao was a very pleasant if slightly pricy experience it would be great if the ipads used to place orders could have an english version of the menu to help tourists and those of us who are mandarin challenged,Positive
hai-di-lao,this was a great restaurant a little expensive but the food and service were exceptional the spice was a little extreme for us but they were happy to adjust it would definitely try it again,Positive
hai-di-lao,yummy tasty pricey attentive service pricey but it is worth it because of it is service and quality really one of a kind must try avoid peak periods otherwise the queue is madness,Positive
hai-di-lao,nothing worthwhile to make you queue as its soup is as salty as seawater esp after i added in more plain water i have to apologise that its freshness in food and impeccable service cannot save this expensive restaurant for getting such a rating from me having too much salt is equivalent of consuming a beautifully decorated cake w poisonits bill didnt come cheap for two adults a kid who are totally small eaters close to s  my friend confirmed that she had a meal at the clark quay branch too nothing fascinating toopatronized at,Negative
hai-di-lao,best hotpot in town with good variety of soup and fresh food price is on the high side though,Positive
hai-di-lao,long long long long long wait and guess what it was not worth the wait just the same type of hot pot you can get anywhere in singapore or just go at a time when there are not too many people this was our one and only time waiting for a table in singapore and we have learned our lesson make a reservation which i do not think this place takes or just go somewhere else why do people torture themselves just for plain hot pot,Negative
tong-heng,real good petsthis tiny bakery produces phenomenal egg tarts or as i call them portuguese egg tarts pets but here they are uniquely square shaped they are right up there in quality with golden gate bakery of san francisco chinatown rich sweet creamy egg custard filling in a flaky dainty crust its a luxury indulgence given that two pets will buy you a nice complete lunch maxwell food centre a few blocks away across the street from buddah tooth relic temple museum,Positive
tong-heng,authentic bakery in chinatown food drink the coconut egg tart was something else we have never had one before and this is just one of the many places around singapore to get it a perk is you can get a box full of a dozen pretty easily price only   sgd for one egg tart atmosphere we came in in the middle of the day when it was very hot there was a seating area where you could enjoy your treats that was air conditioned and it was a perfect break from the sweltering heat in chinatown tips they sell a variety of baked goods other than egg tarts,Positive
tong-heng,we visited the chinatown heritage centre the day before where one of the exhibits mentioned tong heng and their famous egg tarts i love egg tarts so i made it a point to check this place out conclusion solid egg tart but nothing special there are no advantages of making the egg tart in a diamond shape versus the regular circular base not worth going out of your way to try,Negative
tong-heng,nice egg tart was not sure i would like it but it was delicious nice clean store and helpful employees,Positive
tong-heng,i decided to go to tong heng for their diamond shaped egg tarts due to their long family history in the business from watching a food bloggers video the egg tarts were alright maybe because i am a fan of the flaky crust i did not enjoy it as much it is definitely not terrible above average but it just did not meet my expectations,Negative
tong-heng,double thumbs up for their egg tarts tong heng is a real timeless institution that has been around for at least  years they are well known among the locals for having the best egg tart in singapore and when they are that famous i just had to check it out for myself the store lies at the heart of chinatown just along south beach road the shop itself is petite in space but interior is very bright and proper they also have quite an arrays of delicacies that are displayed inside the glass cabinet and of course coffee drink to go along with the sweets the diamond shaped egg tart is truly unique the shells have thick layers of crisp pastry almost like it was deep fried and the custard filling is so smooth wobbly and a bliss in each bite each tart cost around   small price to pay for one of a kind sweet indulgence,Positive
tong-heng,it is funny to squeeze in this tiny shop usually to a crowd of grandmas buying boxes or some guy with a video camera zooming in on the little pig pastries the cashiers are really efficient and the space is small but clean and brightly lit with all the pastries nicely displayed i keep bringing friends here and really recommend their egg tarts tong heng mastered the recipe with fresh flaky crust and soft custard filling i actually love the coconut egg tart more than the original as you get more texture and sweetness from the shredded coconut i will always make tong heng a stop when i am in town,Positive
tong-heng,to begin with we ordered the coconut tart and the chicken puff with coffee when we bit into the tart we realised it was the plain egg tart we immediately approached the counter and told them that the order was not right the young guy behind the counter started to rudely tell us off by saying that we ordered the egg one and it was our fault for not pointing to the coconut one i had heard my partner saying very clearly that she wanted the coconut and pointing to it the woman also gave us an attitude anyway i decided to buy the coconut tart even though my partner wanted to leave they should have offered us to pay the difference and i would have given it a higher rating than two stars long story short the egg tart the coconut tart and the chicken puff are all tasty but they know that people will keep coming back no matter how they are treated so they do not care,Negative
tong-heng,i drop by whenever i am at china town the egg tart has always been of the same good standard over the years the egg is smooth and the skin is crispy the only person with the egg tart is that the price keeps going up,Positive
tong-heng,came here in mid morning for some famous rectangular dan ta after a morning of exploring chinatown nearby the cashier lady was an older obasan who was extremely patient and kind with us as we scoured the display window for a avoid the sun snack we decided on dan ta is each their powdered bread which i totally forgot the name the baked goods were not spectacular but that is because we are spoiled with delicious california baked goods and cheap fresh taiwanese bakery bread when we travel their dan ta has a crunchier and thinner not flaky crust and sweeter egg in the center it was pretty good just made differently and just as fresh their powdered bread was not the business we felt like it was just bread with powdered sugar on top nothing special looking around we saw that they also offered other baked sweets as well as more kitchen made orders like soups and porridges it is great to get a dan ta if you are in the ann siang hill chinatown area but it is not some place i would say is a distinguishing part of singaporean local eats,Positive
tong-heng,just get the egg tarts forget about the rest the coffee is terrible but they do warn you it is from a sachet mix the egg tart is usually warm so it is best to eat it right there and then the custard is wobbly soft and the crust is a bit crumbly when you bite into it have it cool and the shape holds better but it also means it is slightly firmer it is sweet but not overly so it does make a good tea time or any time snack it is a nice treat to have once in a while,Positive
tong-heng,yesss their egg tarts were amazing i highly recommend getting the coconut one too which was my favorite the shell looks like it would be hard but it was buttery and soft probably one of the best egg tarts i have had,Positive
tong-heng,excellent quality custard tarts which come in two flavors unique tart custard with coconut and the traditional custard tart the custard perfect and light also tried a couple other items a sesame cookie with red bean paste and another with lotus bean filling all very delicious i am gonna have to run an extra two miles tomorrow morning cause i am gaining weight the staff a very friendly and efficient,Positive
tong-heng,love the omelet kaya toast the toast is super crispy topped with egg and kaya spread on top delicious they sell three different types of kaya coconut egg jam by the jar with the nonya kaya being the most popular they even let you sample before you buy i am definitely taking some home will need to sample one of those egg tarts while i am at it,Positive
tong-heng,service ive seen comments on good service but maybe it was an off day but they were not very welcoming nice food egg tart and moon cake was good atmosphere overall fine price   egg tartdiamond shaped egg tarts was a first i feel like the ratio of crust to egg was different because it is a seemingly pretty popular place it seemed like their egg tarts had a decent turn over so getting fresh warmer ones may be the norm the custard is not too thick and it is silky which is nice i tried the normal one not the coconut the moon cake with lotus paste was also good not overly wow ed by the place if i was in the area and craving egg tarts maybe i would return but at this point i would not go out of my way to do so,Negative
tong-heng,super friendly service some of the best egg tarts in singapore best part the tarts are uniquely diamond shaped so they stand out from the others try to get the ones that are piping hot fresh out of the oven one bite and you will be hooked they are insanely delicious warm flaky crust with the right amount of custard to crust ratio i still prefer their original tarts over the coconut but i must point out that they are made with some big pieces of shredded coconut extra plus i did not get to try their other baked goods items but it looks like they specialize in wedding cookies too,Positive
tong-heng,located near maxwell food centre and in the vicinity of chinatown you find this shop opposite a taoist temple along south bridge road i usually recommend this confectionary shop to my foreign friends as they sell decent egg tarts and other pastries good for our taste bug but bad for our stomach eat the egg tarts warm as you get the best out of this delicious snack the others are average nothing to shout about but it is worth giving them a try i would recommend buying a few and head elsewhere to enjoy it like carolyn the other reviewer had mentioned the coffee is mediocre so if you are nearby maxwell food centre orchinatown remember to head down best is to leave some space for some egg tarts after a meal you will probably feel very satisfied enjoy,Positive
tong-heng,order the egg tarts best egg tarts i have tasted crust is flaky and the inside is warm and custardy there was no line as we got there pretty early,Positive
tong-heng,most of the times i have been here every egg tart i have gotten has been warm from the oven having said that eating it warm and cold has a marked difference eat it cold you wo not like the crust because it becomes hard eat it warm and the crust is crispy three stars because i do not like a crispy crust but the custard is light eggy and not too sweet i still do buy it sometimes yum,Positive
tong-heng,i cannot believe i completely forgot to write a review for tong heng it is been nearly a month since i have had these and i am still dreaming about them i happened to be in the area and stopped by to pick up a couple tarts i am kicking myself for not getting more and char siew pastry puffs for the family and they were definitely pleasantly surprised i did not get a chance to sit down at tong heng is to have them fresh but trust me heat them up a little when you get home and i can bet they are as good as they are fresh if not then i am really missing out the egg tarts are lightly sweet and just egg y enough and the pastry is a little different being crumbly rather than flaky and i love it the char siew pastry puffs are just as good in my opinion sweet and flaky but with the right amount of savory to do the char siew justice so it is whatever you are in the mood for or have them both,Positive
tong-heng,my expectations were high for what i have been told are the best egg tarts ever perhaps that was the problem these bad boys are diamond shaped with a light and wobbly custard i just did not really like the crust it was too buttery and very crumbly which just was not my cup of tea i also like my custard sweeter but again this is probably just down to personal preferences i actually preferred their char siew pastry puffs which was petite but packed with flavour best ever hmm debatable definitely worth a pick up if i am in the area though,Positive
tong-heng,soft filling egg custard in crunchy yet not sticky with natural fragrance tart base most tradisional and delicious egg tart for egg tarts lover have others pastries in the shop as well siu bao needed improvements love the tarts most over,Positive
tong-heng,everybody loves the egg tart at tong heng why cos it is simply awesome and in my humble opinion no other egg tarts in sg can ever be compared to this diamond shaped egg tart many people have come and bought egg tarts here but to enjoy tong heng to the fullest there are some things at tong heng you gotta know  if you are buying egg tarts to go kindly note that boxes will only be used to put your egg tarts if you purchase more than  egg tarts preferably buy in multiples of  so that you can ensure all your egg tarts will be safe in box with comfortable space to keep the egg tarts intact  cant finish the awesome tarts and dont know what to do with them store them in the refrigerator you will be surprised that the cold egg tarts actually taste pretty good too i personally like it very much p if refrigerated egg tarts are not your thing you can still keep them in the fridge but just heat the tarts up slightly and they will still taste marvelous  a well kept secret in tong heng is a dish that only the insiders will know they dont have it on their menu perhaps cos it takes a lot of effort to make it but if you have the time for a good sinful afternoon tea snack you gotta order the tong heng french toast what french toast you ask yes i kid you not their french toast is not the typical ang moh toast soaked and fried in egg only it actually comes slabbed with a layer of delicious kaya too the portion of the french toast is pretty huge so do bring a friend or  to enjoy this delectable treat together dont be selfish ya be warned though that it can be pretty oily and greasy but for a once a blue moon indulgence i am willing to accept all the calories that its worth all this writing is making me salivate thinking about the egg tarts and the french toast gosh time to make a trip down tong heng again soon,Positive
tong-heng,based on what i ordered which was the lotus bread w salted egg i wanted to try something other than what everyone was ordering the bread had very little filling after  bites all the fillings were gone but i still had the bread left so i just tossed it,Negative
tong-heng,very fresh and good egg tarts the custard is not so sweet and still hot as it just come out from the oven this is one of the best egg tarts in singapore,Positive
tong-heng,the diamond shape is cute but it kinda makes it harder to eat or i am just not used to it it is like wobbly and could quite easily just break apart if you do not hold it right the custard is good though but i really was not feeling the crust so if i come again i will prob just not eat the crust,Negative
tong-heng,i am rather particular with my egg tarts call me an egg tart connoisseur if you will golden gate bakery in sf mediocre at best never understood the long lines tai cheong in hk the creme de la creme of egg tarts well worth the long lines tong heng in sg among the best try to get them when they are fresh from the oven egg tart orgasm guaranteed from the crust to the creamy egg filling and perfectly sweet,Positive
tong-heng,the egg tarts are unique not just in shape but also in the way they are made the crust is not the traditional cookie or flaky crust instead it is like a very thin pie crust the custard itself is also lighter than the typical ones you get from hk or other parts of the world kinda like soya beancurd it is a nice change i wish they came piping hot from oven though jonasapproved,Positive
tong-heng,this place has killed all other egg tarts for me i have been coming here since i was a tot and seen various outlets appear in malls and then die a torturous death whenever i pass by i have to pick up some it is not me it is the the siren song of these tarty things the auntie will always ask how many you want and i will go however many can go into a box squeezy also never mind prices have gone up significantly over the years but the standard is just as good tip for the uninitiated these babies are not meant to be kept overnight else the eggy bits will get a little watery and the crust soggy also when you open the box in the morning you will find that the eggy part has an earthquake like split down the middle not sure why either that or some have gone missing and your pesky little brother will vehemently deny all knowledge of the incident all the while wiping crumbs off his face,Positive
tong-heng,i very rarely like egg tarts but i will make an exception for tong heng is diamond shaped ones eating is a bit of a challenge though you need a large enough plate and a hungry stomach to gobble it all up at once when eaten warm the custard bit is soft and oozy while the pastry is flaky and yummy one tart is pretty sizeable and makes a great way to cap off a meal,Positive
tong-heng,you can probably get the best egg tarts in singapore here the go to place for egg tarts and lou por bang aka wife biscuits tong heng has been churning out these delactable treats for more than  years and judging by the queues you see everyday you know you wont be let down the egg custard they produce is soft and amazingly smooth especially when it is served warm and made even more delicious when coupled with an equally well executed flaky pastry base,Positive
tong-heng,egg tarts are segregated into two leagues there are egg tarts and then there are godly egg tarts tong heng is egg tarts belong firmly in the latter category the custard filling is slightly wobbly not too much just enough to titillate but still solid enough to require biting through there i was half slurping the eggy custard held in its incredibly crisp and fluffy tart cup not being able to get over the fact that i only found out about singapore is best egg tart quarter of a century later tong heng also sells gai zai beng very rarely found in singapore anymore and some other confectionaries which i did not pay attention to,Positive
tong-heng,the first bite into a piece of egg tart from tong heng and already an impression was created for us traditionally chinese egg tarts are made with shortcrust pastry and many true old school bakeries still make them this way over the years many bakeries gradually started making egg tarts with puff pastry the diamond shaped chinese egg tarts at tong heng look like they are made with shortcrust pastry take a bite into the pastry and there is an element of surprise there the pastry is made up of thin flaky and crisp layers that make up the shell of the tart it is a perfect balance between shortcrust and flaky puff pastry the crust is what makes tong heng stand out truly these egg tarts are one of the best we will probably have in a while at only   for each egg tart the more reason you should eat more than one,Positive
tong-heng,the steamed egg is too sweet but the egg tart is the best i have had in singapore sooooo good,Positive
tong-heng,tong heng is the perfect treat after a tiring shopping day in chinatown around afternoon tea time egg tart is a must the best egg tarts in singapore if you still have some stomach space try also the wife and husband biscuits or any biscuits they have for some reasons though i do not prefer them for da bao i just cannot help it if i da bao it the more likely i will get fined for eating in the mrt hahaha d,Positive
tong-heng,went to this bakery since i read the review about the egg tart it is different than the other egg tart boxy shape thicker and non flaky crust filling is less sweet and thicker compared to the regular egg tart i still prefer the portuguese style flaky egg tart but this is not bad i will be back to try the other pastries that looks good too,Positive
tong-heng,after eating our hokkien style noodles at food stall  we back tracked through the hustle and bustle of chinatown to get dessert since our stomachs were still not full from the late lunch and well starvation on a jetstar plane ride can do crazies to your mind and stomach so back we went to tong heng as i pointed it out initially saying hey tong heng is not that the place where in our guide book it said it had the best egg tarts well that is already a mighty fine statement when saying best egg tarts back in san francisco the golden gate bakery totally states that they have the best egg tarts and makes patrons wait from their loooooong vacation to finally get them i wo not go into that story as there were about   times throughout a calendar year where we went to the store and they were on vacation so the boyfriend and i crossed the street to tong heng and saw two different types of egg tarts more curious is that the shape is something we have never encountered in your typical eggy tart diamond shaped that is just weird well not to discriminate with shape we bought one of the regular egg tarts and one with coconut came out to   coconut one was   and regular was   now i am not a big fan of egg tarts in general but i will eat them regardless food is food and if it is supposed to be good then heck i will eat it so i took a bite out of the normal one just was not what i was expecting a bit runny and missing something just not sure what but it did not blow me away i decided to take on the coconut one super runny and liquid like maybe it is supposed to be that way but i am used to something different i will stick to the ones back in california especially the portuguese style ones,Negative
tong-heng,i do not profess to be an egg tart expert but the diamond shaped tarts here are pretty damn good shuffle in amongst the crowd speak up and have your money at the ready before long you will be stuffing a squidgy warm centred egg tart in your face out the front,Negative
tong-heng,yummy egg tarts and char sew sou the crisps are alright but a tad too pricey ps the closest parking lot is the maxwell food court open carpark,Positive
tong-heng,eggs tarts my favorite i have not been here yet or even in singapore lol but the looks of it is very eye catching so maybe one day on my bucket list,Positive
tong-heng,great egg tarts are hard to come by these days although they are pretty much sold everywhere in singapore most are nothing like tong heng is i love the custard filling as it is wobbly and smooth when eaten warm having the custard slide down your throat is like a piece of heaven the tart is buttery giving it a luxurious taste it crumbles just enough yet holds the eggy custard together well while the egg tarts i have had at tong heng have been consistently good over the years the service has slowly deteriorated it almost seems as if there is some sort of double standard going on where tourists get better quality of service whereas locals are treated impatiently i guess it does not really bother me too much as i tend to dash in and out of the store pretty quickly getting my share of egg tarts but if you are going to stand there and deliberate over what to get be prepared for annoyed looks and somewhat rude service,Positive
tong-heng,came here twice during my mini trip to singapore it was right by my hotel in the chinatown area and the egg tarts were delish the filling was gooey and smooth yummm second time i came during the evening to pick up some morning snacks on my flight back and there was a line out the shop definitely recommend coming here in the afternoon to avoid the crowds,Positive
night-safari,honestly i was disappointed i have heard about this being some awesome unique amazing event perhaps my expectations were too high i attended the night creatures show which was cool but two of the animals never did their trick or showed their talent i get it animals get a vote but the trainers just could not get it done then the  minute tram ride it was a neat idea but most of the animals just laid around like they do during the day only parts of the exhibits were lite up so in some cases the trains automated narration would call of animals i never even saw because the corona virus is going around the park was actually pretty empty which was nice if you have the chance do this maybe the animals will be more active for you i did the   time slot i am glad i crossed it off my list but i wo not go back,Negative
night-safari,night safari had cool animals but you only got to see about half of them they are incredibly mindful and respectful towards the animals so you literally feel like you are actually going on a safari in the night time the whole zoo is entirely dark and they only have a few lights per enclosure with extremely dim light so if the animals are not out in that particular spot you will miss them although a lot of recommendations online tell you not to do all three zoo activities in one day i believe pretty much everyone does the night safari has a horrendous wait the entrance line to get in the tram line and the show line felt like a war or zombie invasion people are incredibly aggressive and obviously all want to be in front and get in i think the show is the best part everything else besides the waits require extreme patience acceptance to disappointment in case you do not get to see half the animalsi did this under  hours but i am sure you could take a little extra time if you like this location is kind of in the middle of nowhere but not too far from the main part of singapore it takes roughly  minutes to get here from the city from my experience night safari and river safari are cool to do but not necessary if you have to choose one out of the three if i had to put them in order it would be singapore zoo night safari then river safari,Positive
night-safari,we had tickets to the night safari for friday night at  pm but our dinner went longer than expected so we did not get here until  pm also it takes a long time to get here from downtown you take a subway to a stop far north then have to find a very poorly designated spot for a shuttle to take you the rest of the way also important to note the zoo closes at midnight as does the public transportation if you do not drive you are stuck taking a cab which cost us about  usd to get back downtown not too bad all things considered and there were several taxis waiting by the exit i was kind of bummed we got only about an hour and a half to explore but we made the most of it since it was so late the park was mostly empty so we did not run into the crowds other people talked about our local friend advised us to skip the show so we jumped on the tram instead it was a short tour around the zoo but we saw some amazing sights from rhinos to elephants to a tiger some of the animals are free roaming and were feeding right next to the tram which was a nice surprise afterwards we tried to see as much of the zoo as possible on foot which is a bit tiring since it is very hilly and very dark still it is pretty incredible to see a zoo where most of the animals are not asleep experiences like a prowling jaguar stalking right toward you hearing a lion roar from across the zoo and seeing a stealthy crocodile swim right near your feet are all pretty unique the zoo is kind of a maze but it seems the employees here have an efficient system for making sure everyone gets out safely when time is up at midnight they cannot exactly turn on the lights or make loud announcements but we got out with no issue the commute is a pain and you have to balance fighting crowds with limited time before time is up it is still a must visit for any zoo enthusiast or animal lover,Positive
night-safari,we went on the jungle cruise inthe afternoon and the night safari in the evening night safari is awesome and the sights and animals are wonderful,Positive
night-safari,i had the best time at the night safari even with a  pm entrance on a saturday night i arrived to the premise around  pm but i like that the times are staggered for crowd control to kill time there is a food court with different cuisines i opted for overpriced indian food but it was so hot that i ate just to eat right upon entering at  pm i dashed to the tram tour that lasted under an hour lots of animals were in hiding but few were out and about after the tour i walked the different trails one of my favorite parts was stumbling upon feeding time a zookeeper had a bucket of cut fruits and as he tossed them around the area many of the animals came out from hiding at the moment i cannot recall which type of animal i just remembered that the animals looked happy chomping away my other favorite part about the safari was the live animal show the animals not sure what kind performed various tricks after the show you can take a photo with the animals well the zookeeper holds the animal and is also in the picture with you the night safari is suitable for all audiences ranging from kids to adults to elders exploring the safari makes for a great date night idea,Negative
night-safari,night safari used to be a five star experience for me however this time it definitely lost lustre night safari is the world is first night zoo the park uses special lighting for visitors to enjoy nocturnal behaviours of animals around the world my family and i have bookmarked it as a must do every time we come we bought a  parkhopper pass to see all the wildlife themed parks in singapore for a great price of s  per adult this includes all the tram rides i noticed that i had to book an entry time for night safari which surprised me i chose the   pm entry the park closes at   am after midnight when we arrived the crowds were so thick that we were pushed body to body the   pm group was herded to the creatures of the night show which i remembered to be rather stunning and interesting in the past but sitting with shoulders hips and legs touching your neighbour in a crowded amphitheater diminished our experience of the show this time we exited quickly because we knew that there was going to be a mad rush for the tram ride after the show ended we left our seats after the otter recycling even so we were not the only ones we continued to wait for more than half an hour to get on a tram ride the ride was probably the best part of the evening we got to see the tapirs really close we did not get to hear the tigers roar we saw a lot of deer usually we made time to walk through the trails but the thickness of the crowds on this june peak time because of school holidays we decided to go home i do not envy the park staff who have the unfortunate job of managing loud and pushy visitors,Negative
night-safari,had such an amazing time on the night safari tonight i am sure most people give lower ratings because of the long lines which there definitely were some very long lines to wait in to get on the tram but the experience was awesome we got to see some animals that only come out at night which you never get to see in a regular zoo there were tigers walking around deer roaming free which were right next to the tram maybe a foot or two away at some point wolves howling and many more amazing things to see the lines are long but do not let that stop you from coming here it was worth the wait,Positive
night-safari,so night safari sounds super cool right too bad it rains everyday in singapore more like singa pour and the animals seal shelter just as we do unfortunate experience for us really it is expensive a meal for one is  tickets are  the trolley takes you around the main strip and you can see all sorts of animals hippos elephants deer zebras hyenas all sorts of pigs etc cool to see but it is dark you cannot get any pics of them and you kind feel sad that they are kept enclosed by electrocuted fences i wondered how they could have a lion across from a zebra without anything happening the zoo is really open so the animals do not appear to be caged which is a really cool view but i am sure we would have enjoyed it without the rain our tour guide said it would take an hour to walk the  walking trails to see a closer look of the animals and it took us roughly  min there just was not anything to look at fortunately we found a tiger laying right on the glass easily the coolest thing we saw they shirts for  are a rip off go to the market they are  for  just do not buy anything here the food selection is scarce like they force you to eat at their  a meal restaurants or you are stuck eating finger foods that were pre made hours ago for  hmmm you win there safari i actually saw a beer jug for  insane must be fun if you have kids maybe idk skip it as an adult,Negative
night-safari,the safari was truly the best experience ever i was quite impressed by the way they have managed the place to make sure that we got the best view of all the animals we took the tram not the trail as we were pretty tired by the end of the day the only reason why i cannot give this place a  star review is because of dinner it was so disgusting the quality of food was poor the place was sweaty like hell and it was outrageously expensive  per person not worth it at all,Negative
night-safari,first thing buy your tickets online dont buy them at the zoo itself because you are only allowed in based on your slotted time and the lines are so long we arrived at   pm and waited until  to get in for the   slot time was killed watching the fire dancers and wondering through gift stores and these people start lining up at like   pm to get in for the   so people dont play here also this place is super far from changi and center city it is at least  mins to an hour to get out here depending if you bus train etc it is quite a trek out here even for people like myself who have been to singapore often enough to call it a distant home second hydrate before you go singapore is humid and hot and you will dehydrate anywhere you go in singapore if you dont bring adequate water but the good thing is that there is free water filling stations around so make sure you are doing that third if you were hoping for pics forget it it is nocturnal and the only pics you will get is the animal show the animal show is not bad and you will see their alright length python binturong river otters fishing cat hyena owls and couple of others i thought the show was alright if you have time worth sitting and getting pics with the animals other wise you re better off on the tram ride and walking the trailsthe tram alright the lines are so long that most of your time will be eaten up with the waiting in line and then the fairly long ride i thought the tram ride was satisfying for the time i waited for my   slot and the  min waiting time to get on my tram you definitely get to see creatures in open air and a lot of them roaming freely deer tapir and some others that you wont get to see in other zoos bc they are nocturnal i thought the tigers and lions were huge compared to other zoos where i thought the creatures were smaller than i expected it is night time so it will be cooling avoid talking loudly and no flash during the night you will get dinged for this at the show and at the tram so dont be that person trails we were so tired from waiting in line and trekking across singapore to get here that we didn t do any trails so come early book online and be prepared for the long long trek across the country if you are based in changgi airport,Positive
night-safari,the zoo in the dark yes yes and yes it was as though i was transported into the movie jurassic park riding along in the tram i knew i was safe but at the same time i kept thinking where is the lion can he reach me if he decides he wants a little snack absolutely wonderful a must visit place the tram ride is the best part of the experience the show creatures of the night was just so so but perfect for children,Positive
night-safari,this will be a combined review of both the safari and the restaurant buffet we purchased a package with the buffet and priority tram boarding which seemed like a good deal servicethe dinner was a buffet so self service including beverages the server did occasionally pick up dirty plates but many did stack up on the table over time after dinner we were fairly quickly ushered past the lines onto our tram which was great the commentary on the tram was pre recorded which was ok but i was expecting more customized commentary from the guide also the tram did not even come to a complete stop at many key animal enclosures including the male elephant which is one of the zoo is main highlights this resulted in blurred photos due to tram movement ambiancewell they decided to design an open air buffet in a humid climate at a zoo so low points for ambiance there were fans but it was humid and uncomfortable during the meal bugs were buzzing around also various zoo aromas often wafted in an enclosed air conditioned environment would have been much preferred the tram ride was about  minutes through the park there were several animal exhibits to see but often the tram did not stop so photos were blurred due to movement at night overall it was fairly peaceful and relaxing definitely try to get the priority tram boarding as otherwise lines were long the fire show after the tram ride was quite good and one of the highlights of the experience foodthere was a somewhat varied selection of western and eastern options but the quality overall was low some of the items advertised as chicken on a skewer appeared gray in color not normal for chicken the tandoori was probably the best normal appearing chicken breast meat the ice creams were poorly frozen and were melty immediately after scooping them many items were uncovered which seemed odd in an open air buffet beverage options were severely limited water or hot tea or coffee no soda fountain or other cold drinks jujuthis was overall a unique experience to see the animals at night which one does not get the chance to at other zoos the tram was cool definitely go for the priority boarding package the buffet was quite disappointing avoid it as it is underwhelming to say the least and frankly a bit gross in some respects,Negative
night-safari,i went back and forth on this it is recommended by a few places even shows up in some suggested itineraries in travel guides but in the end i feel like it fell short to start it is not easy to get to several bus transfers and a long ride it is worth looking in to how to get here which i really did not and booking a ticket on a non stop bus from downtown if that is where you are staying once there you can buy your way home on a non stop bus which will cost a few sgd more than the public buses but is much faster once inside there is a creatures of the night show which i skipped and a tram ride which i skipped with the idea being that the tram only shows part of the zoo while the walking trails cover all of it so i started my walk and the first few stops were animal no shows i know the zoo cannot control this but i was really steeling myself for this to be a bust but it got better however while it is cool to see the animals at night i cannot help but think it would be even better to see them during the day you know when you can see them better maybe all of these animals are nocturnal but i sure do not think so and even then some were still sleeping so yes i saw them but i did not see them doing anything as others have pointed out the exhibits are largely completely open air which is cool and there are a lot of animals that i do not feel like i would see at a zoo in the us however i made the mistake of doing this the first full day i was in singapore after flying in from the us and being active most of the day i needed a nap pretty bad by the time i got here which might have made me less patient i think if i had it to do over again i would visit the zoo during the day or maybe skip entirely,Negative
night-safari,although i appreciate the so called efforts of bringing animal awareness to the people this tour is so commercialized was a little depressing animals are kept awake w low lighting until  pm no flash photos something good i do believe the animals are cared for tho location area has dense foliage to protect most animals from the heat,Positive
night-safari,interesting concept got to see different animals on a tram ride through different sections of the park they all seemed really chill and grubbing on their greens i wonder how they all stay so calm with people near by good for the kids and adults,Positive
night-safari,i absolutely loved my experience at the night safari the timing worked out so that when i entered the zoo a live show was about to start so i went there first the live show was great our announcer i do not remember his name but it was  pm on a wednesday was amazing he was very funny and friendly after the show i went on the tram to see all of the nocturnal animals the narrations were nice albeit a bit too quiet to hear my tram did break about  of the way through the ride so we had to wait for about five minutes for someone to come and tow us back it is too bad that i was not able to hear about the rest of the animals but even without the narration at the end the experience was great,Negative
night-safari,this is a very cool concept and i came into the safari with admittedly high expectations i felt that the show was overrated as it mainly consisted of a trainer walking around for thirty seconds with the animal on their shoulder it was hard to get a good look of the animals given the size of the auditorium and i felt the time given to look at the animals was much to short after finishing the show we embarked on the tram as it is a night safari it is decently hard to see the animals while there are some lights to try to make the viewing experience better for visitors they are dim which is to be expected given the time of day we saw a lot of animals like tigers and giraffes animals that are much more active during the day given that it is night time a lot of these animals were either not moving or sleeping overall it was a cool experience but i would not do it again if you only have a few days in the city there are other things to do that is much better value for your time at around  sgd it is also not cheap,Negative
night-safari,coming here on new year is day not the greatest idea not sure how the crowd and lines are for normal days non holidays but coming here was an absolute zoo pun intended doors open at pm and tickets are available for advance purchase online or at the visitor is centers my friends and i had brought our tickets beforehand at a visitor center and decided to arrive here early to beat the crowd sadly that was not the case the wait to pick up our physical ticket was over an hour long with only  person working the counter for ticket pick up after picking up our physical tickets it was another hour wait to get in the attraction once in the attraction it was starting to get late boarded the tram at pm so my friends and i opted to just go for a ride vs getting on and off to explore the walking trails overall it was a pretty interesting experience to see the animals at night not a whole lot of pictures could be taken with a cellphone or camera since flash photography was forbidden fortunately we were able to see most of the animals that were awake and it was pretty cool to see the lions and such up close as for bugs there were not too many but i did spray bug repellent on prior to boarding the tram the ride itself is roughly half hour long and it is a pretty smooth one in summary if you are a fan of animals and want to see them at night this would be a good attraction to visit however it is a bit overrated in the experience so i would recommend checking out the zoo instead during the day to avoid all the madness at night in addition it is much easier to get here by taxi vs mrt,Positive
night-safari,it is sad to only give this place only  stars however i do not think it is worth a trip to go all the way out here you spend a lot of time in lines we came here part of a packaged tour the tour guide told us that the best plan to make use of our time after the singapore zoo next door was to have dinner inside the night safari park once they open the doors we were then to line up for their earliest tram it was a good tip because everybody lines up way ahead of time the tram ride was disappointing it takes about  minutes it is dark so you cannot really see much there is no fence between you and the animals which i guess is a good thing if you want to see the animals with no barriers but i started imagining the tigers were going to leave their exhibit to come after us as a meal and there would be no fence between us yea by that time i could not wait for the tram ride to be over afterwards there is an animal show but we opted to call it a day and leave since we had to line up for it as well the whole park is a bit overrated definitely not worth a trip unless you have very young kids who would love the experience of seeing so many animals,Positive
night-safari,make sure to wear insect repellent i felt like i was getting bitten the entire night i also recommend spending at least a couple of hours since the tram tour takes  minutes and that did not include the wait time there were also  different self guided walking paths that will take you to different parts of the zoo although it was a little disappointing since i was expecting a lot more animals there were a lot of deers and lemurs lastly it was difficult to take pictures with an iphone since they do not allow flash photography no disturbing the animals tip i repeat no flash photography,Negative
night-safari,well as i was perusing the brochure on singapore that my travel agent gave me my eyes settled on the night safari i am not really sure why i picked it considering i generally do not go on tours unless there are logistical problems getting to the place but this one caught my interest so i decided to book it basically it is a trip of the singapore zoo at night and it is a section of the zoo that has been set aside for noturnal animals you can walk through the zoo on foot or you can catch one of the trams which is why the tour helps because you will end up standing in that line for ages otherwise the tour was not bad but the safari itself was pretty cool they even finished off the night with an animal show though the show only takes  minutes,Negative
night-safari,everything went pretty well but as you know you have only one chance for first impression the lady at ticket desk with name nurhudaya just imagine that she is a queen of the world and can change all the rules whenever she wants but in fact her job just a customer service i do not know why she moved all of us in the line we have been first and after her manipulation we stayed at least sixth floor n the line only because she thought she is goddess here people like her never should work in customer service rude of staff is the worst thing what could happens in such popular place all the rest excellent,Negative
night-safari,able to see a lot of nocturnal animals you wo not get to see in normal zoo lions tigers hyenas were the highlights tram guides give good descriptions exciting to see these creatures so close but a little sad that they are in an enclosure,Positive
night-safari,amazing awesome outstanding a very unique experience that you have to do if you go to singapore did the tram which was awesome the announcer is kind of lame and monotonous but the sights are great all the animals are active and super close to you as you ride by also did the creatures of the night show which is also awesome very funny and enjoyable there was also some kind of fire dancing show going on in the main area with the shops and stuff that was great to watch for a bit too this is a must do period,Positive
night-safari,stopped by here with friends during our trip came on a friday they let in people in waves         we took the tram around the park which took about   min it showed us some exhibitions not all the animals afteards we walked on the trails to see the animals the tram did not take us too it was pretty cool seeing the zoo at night there are  trails having a main focus for each can take   minutes to walk the whole thing recommend to see if a tourist,Negative
night-safari,night zoo aka called night safari when you get to the zoo first take the walking tour so the tram line will decrease i do recommend the walking tour it was nice but we were not super impressed but we loved being on the paths alone hearing lions roar and hyena laugh then we took the tram ride and were really impressed if you bought hop on hop off aka hippo ticket the bus ride to and from the zoo are included in your ticket price and you really should take this as the zoo is very very very at least an hour far from downtown if you take the hop on hop off you will be limited on time so first take the walking tour so the tram line will decrease once you are on the tram it is a  minute tour and it is excellent,Positive
night-safari,we went to night safari on a saturday evening we had read about how crowded this place gets and it was absolutely true during our visit as well we did not purchase the tickets online so it took us about  minutes to purchase tickets on site we missed the show at the entrance it is about  minutes and takes place at top of the hour every hour tram was a good experience we got to see the animals but the line to get on the tram was extremely long also be sure to check the weather when you plan your visit as the creatures of the night show gets canceled in the event of a wet weather as it takes place in the open amphitheater unfortunately we were unable to see this as it was canceled because of the rains,Negative
night-safari,really awesome excursion the animals are very very close in proximity to the tram plenty of wild animals to be in awe of such as lions tigers leopards rhinos giraffes and more they were out in the open air roaming and chilling a little disheartening but also super cool there were the animals that are commonly seen at the zoo like flocks of flamingos bears elephants etc but there were also plenty of animals that i have never seen or heard of like multi color wild boars and rat looking deer etc wish we could take pictures but it was too dark and no flash photography allowed such a great experience to visit late into the night very family friendly and date friendly we loved it,Positive
night-safari,stumbling in the squawking humid darkness you come across a clearing the pool of moonlight gives a herd of barking deer and bharals an eerie glow just a meter or two away you snap a quick picture and retreat but the mother deer still eye you warily as they stand by their young the moment was so magical that you have to catch your breath so you take the tram to the zebra cafe and have a hot dog then it is right back into the jungle with proverbial machete in hand but what is this the only way forward is through a fruit bat tropical forest you turn your collar up against your neck even though these are fruit bats you cannot shake the association with dracula you power walk as fast as possible with eyes on the ground but a fruit bat flies right by to land on a mango you could touch its cute furry back and wide wings but do not because that is not cool he only came by to eat his fruit not deal with silly humans but ah he is so cute now the striped hyenas are something else entirely they move swiftly and make eye contact and maintain that eye contact awkwardly long suddenly the dark boulder inches to your right turns its head to you this gargantuan hyena gives you a toothy grin tripping backwards over the foliage you offer thanks to the invisible glass that the singapore zoo put up around these gorgeous beasts a flying squirrel nearly hits your head in the mangroves oh no big deal or anything just another part of the safari turning a corner the night is utterly silent dark and sweltering warm if not for the smell you would have walked right into an elephant is butt three gigantic elephants calmly shake the earth with each gentle step you do not bother taking a picture because nothing can replicate the awe of walking in on a family of elephants when they are going about their business but you do take a picture of the majestic tiger posing perfectly for you you promptly think this shot will look great on yelp finally i upload something other than food too tired to walk you board the guided tour tram and think to yourself wow where else in the world can i experience something like this the noxious tram fumes and the tour guide is horribly inaccurate scientific facts rip you from your reverie did she seriously say the indian wolves have very special stomachs so they can eat anything they have acid in their stomachs ummmm so do humans and cows and like every animal but okay the fumes continue to irritate your nose and the annoying other tourists are talking about their indigestion you mentally deduct one star off your yelp review yes this safari was amazing and did not cost thousands of dollars like a real one but many things throughout the night will remind you of that fact honestly though the hundreds and hundreds of animals you saw in  hours is probably more than you would see on a real safari you smile smugly that night in your lux pool side hotel room back in downtown in the morning the corners of that smile fall when you hear little kids screaming and laughing in the pool you cannot help but wish to have been woken by the snort of the red river hog you saw last night or the clipping step of that himalayan tahr that almost spit on you,Negative
night-safari,we went to the night safari based on reviews and recommendations from various web sites and travel videos after our visit we decided that night safari is an over hyped recommendation we visited on a saturday night and there was a large crowd during the early evening the creatures of the night show was mediocre because it was cheesy and not very informative in the creatures of the night show theater need to sit close to the middle as possible to be able to get a good view of the animals for the tram ride through the zoo the waiting time in line was longer than the actual ride through the zoo the beginning of the tram boarding line is not clearly marked and was changing while we watched in line we observed that the boarding process could also be more efficient the tram moves relatively quickly through the zoo which made the sighting animals hard suggest walking through the zoo instead of the tram to allow better viewing of the animals there is an express tram option added cost that offers guides alternative languages to english but it looked like all the trams moved relatively quickly through the zoo we would not recommend this attraction to family and friends,Negative
night-safari,it is a good tour and singapore is making a major effort to protect these endangered animals so a lot of what you pay is for the welfare of them the habitat for each of the animals is better than what you would see in most zoos the only real criticism we had is that the tram goes fairly fast so you do not have much time to observe each of the groups of animals especially since it is dark,Positive
night-safari,the worst safari we have ever been the endless line is their theme oversold is their business model after one hour disastrous entrance we had to wait another hour to see the show because of its lousy limited capacity it took us  hours waiting only for a tram ride in this nightmare adventure,Negative
night-safari,most unique experience ever it was really great being able to see all the animals active although nearing  a lot of them were starting to sleep just a few suggestions before heading into here tips bring mosquito repellant i have  bites on my legs from walking all around buy your ticket online i got mine for  usd unless you have a really nice camera i would not bother taking pictures on the tram it is just black on black cause it is so dark even when you are walking around it is quite difficult to get good photos eat before coming food is pricey here as is any amusement park they also do not check your bags so you can bring your own snack in so the night safari is around the singapore zoo and opens at  pm i would recommend taking the tram the first time around and then doing the walking trails there is  of them there is several animals you can see better on the tram instead of on the path ex lions there is a couple of shows as well creatures of the night and a fire performance both run about  times a day so make sure you catch both of them my favorite exhibits were the bats you get to walk through an enclosed area with bats flying all around they stick bananas and oranges around the walkway so you can get an even better close up view of them,Positive
night-safari,singapore is night safari was one of the highlights from my trip i have been to many other zoos during the daytime where the animals are essentially sleeping and inactive not so with this safari the boars hyenas lions civets and many others were so entertaining to watch in action they seem they can get so close to you too a bat was eating a banana four feet from my face those caged sections take courage to venture into but are certainly worth it the park is balanced well with a vehicle guided portion and walking self guided part we went during the week highly recommended and was able to complete it in under two hours the hardest part is getting out there as it is not very close to the city but overall certainly worth planning to do,Positive
night-safari,great experience here i mostly self toured the area after a brief tram ride great variety of exhibits that allow you to see many active nocturnal animals that usually are just sleeping in any regular zoo the large enclosure with the flying fox bats was really impressive the first time i saw a flying fox inside the area i thought there was a hovering beaver in the sky they are huge walking by the lion enclosure i got to see up close a lion roar that was the first time i would ever seen heard that even after having spent months in kenya on wildlife research would be a great experience for families with kids,Positive
night-safari,highly disorganized nightmare despite our tickets to the   entry we did not even enter the park until nearly  still in line to board a tram nearly an hour later river safari closed by  and nocturnal creatures show sold out highly recommend researching before you commit to this,Negative
night-safari,my friend jenny and i loved the night safari it is disneyland meets jurassic park meets a very cool nighttime zoo experience we figured out how to take the singapore buses to get to the night safari we wore dress to avoid the mosquitos but per usual in singapore the weather was hot before we visited all the animals we saw a very neat fire show i highly recommend checking it out then we spent much of the evening both walking and riding the trolley to check out all the animals we joked that we hoped these same animals did not have to work during the day at the zoo but i expect it would be a pain to move all the animals back and forth i doubt there are many places in the world where you can go on a night safari where the animals are prepared to be best viewed at night it is a little bit of a cheesy experience as all zoos are but i would still highly recommend it,Positive
night-safari,sick of the heat and humidity then come to the night safari ride the open safari tour train and feel the cool refreshing tropical breeze as the train glides through the tropical rainforest the safari is next to singapore zoo and is open at night there are usually long ticket queues and the zoo goers with safari tickets come here when the zoo is closed and the nigh safari is about to open so i would recommend getting here early to avoid the crowds at the entrance there is a show with men dressed in tribal outfits doing a fire show very cool and gets you in a mood ready for a safari experience the safari itself is a huge rainforest with lots of exotic nocturnal animals and some not so nocturnal animals which which will be asleep there are  options for seeing the safari  the open safari tour train complete with a guide and  walking around the grounds exploring for yourself i recommend the safari train the rainforest is so big that it will be difficult to see everything by walking the train has stops throughout so people can get off and explore through the walking tracks and then head back to the train stop to get on the next train the toilets are the best i have ever been to they have the wooden safari theme are outdoors and have lush oversized green leaves from the rainforest hanging in a one of a kind experience a must do in singapore,Positive
night-safari,it was ok but i had much higher expectations while i found it fun walking in the dark surrounded by the sounds and sights of animals in the natural surroundings i found the overall experience to be ok but nothing i would care to do again i recommend that you start off walking and using the tram later on after the initial lines subside there is a creatures of the night show which is rather cheesy but i did find the otters recycling cans skit kind of cute i had issues with the different walks because the animals were often hiding in and out of view or were uninteresting when in view of all the creatures the hyenas were most interesting they were the only aniamls that seem to be aware of my presence and seemed to have an intelligent look about them as if they were planning on how they could escape the safari and eat all of us human beings when you get on the tram it is a bit useful in getting oriented on the size of the night safari and where everything is was disappointed with the outback trail because the suspension bridge was closed off i did notice that towards the end of the safari after  pm the animals seemed more animated tips walk about the park first take tram later avoid the show unless you are tired and just want no brainer activity be prepared for a couple of stenchy moments as the area around the flamingo stinks pretty badly,Negative
night-safari,the night show was quite entertaining the crowd was diverse and seemed quite taken in by the theatrics i do think the train around the park is also the highlight of the park make sure you see the majestic lion if it is not asleep it is definitely a place i would return to with my family little cousins in tow would recommend,Positive
night-safari,i did not think i would make it to the night safari but i am really happy i made the trek out to the zoo although i have traveled to other places in southeast asia i am a true southern california girl and i get all crazy when the weather rises above  degrees i thought the price was a little expensive at first however i definitely think it is worth the money after walking around all day the safari was a nice way to relax and ride around in a tram for a little it was also very fun exciting to see the animals so close without any barriers it is very crowded so i suggest lining up once you purchase your ticket the show was entertaining and they incorporated the audience so i could tell a lot of children around me had a lot of fun,Positive
night-safari,this was a good experience for us to be seated in a train and driven thru the park and experience animals up close and in a pseudo natural setting they have many different animals here and is a good way to experience the zoo for folks who dont want to or dont have the time to see the zoo the shows at the night safari are good too,Positive
night-safari,used to be better now you are force to wait for your time allotment after buying your tickets there is not a whole lot of waiting places free that are cool and comfortable while you are at it also the creatures of the night show used to have more animals now it is so boring that people were walking out midway of the show it is sad,Negative
night-safari,this is a must if you visit singapore i mean where else will you get to experience a zoo at night zoo opens at   pm we were staying at a hotel closer to orchard street and took the mrt and bus to get here overall the commute to get here was about  minutes so we arrived at the zoo closer to  pm the place was busy when we arrived so i am thankful we bought the tickets online a few days prior i suggest doing the same since we all basically walked in while everyone else was in line to buy their tickets i was able to show the tickets on my smart phone and they scanned it off my phone each ticket purchased also allows you access to their tram i highly recommend going on the tram since they tour you around the zoo and point out all the different kinds of animals i enjoyed this since walking around a dark zoo at night and hearing different noises was a bit scary if you feel like walking around the zoo you have free reign to walk down whichever designated path you choose there is also a bat cage you can walk through if you feel brave enough i along with the company i was with were a bit jet lagged and tired when we got to the zoo but we enjoyed it nonetheless this is one of my favorite attractions in singapore and i would recommend it to anyone visiting this country,Positive
night-safari,we went on a tour group and thank goodness we did we went on a busy night and not only were we able to bypass the queue but we had our own tram nice attraction especially for the kiddos the tram is great since we did not have to walk so perfect for seniors and lazy kids i believe there are night trails which i think would be very cool to do but there are also free roaming animals they were warning us of animals coming up to our tram and not to touch them i came close to a few deers and i must admit i was a little worried i was going to get attacked with my luck creatures of the night show was cute and the host was funny and entertaining nothing spectacular but might as well check it out if you are already there,Positive
night-safari,worth visiting just for the whole night safari experience which you do not get in a regular zoo however you will most likely see more animals at the daytime zoo the creatures of the night show is entertaining even though it seems to be designed more for the younger audience otherwise the night safari is only  tram ride and rest  is walking along the paths just as you would at a normal zoo getting to and from the zoo takes time and it is good to aim to be at the zoo at pm in order to have enough time there and to still catch a bus back to the centre overall great experience,Positive
night-safari,it is zoooooooooooo time i am a night time person and i often like to do nighttime actives the city never sleeps abelle does not sleep either lol while i was visiting singapore i was hoping to do some out of the ordinary fun time actives that were fun and interesting i found out this zoo opens at seven pm and close at midnight i have never been to a zoo that opens this late and close this late a must the area is clean lots of cool animals there are cute statutes of animals as well i suggest ridding the zoo train takes you around the whole zoo you wo not miss a thing when i came here i made a mistake by not taking the train there is a huge line but the wait is not bad about ten mins each train and there is about multiple trains stoping for pickup there are food stands but closed lol i went inside the bat cage where you get to walk thought the bat cage and all different types of bats fly all over you for about five minutes it scared the shit out of me after strolling around the zoo i took the train and it was the best part animals were everywhere and there was a conductor announcing all types of stuff to notified you what is going on and what to see even teach you a feel things or two at the end of the tour i saw two elephants waving good bye and going some awesome tricks it was something i never seen before the elephants iv seen in everyday zoo just sit there or walks around or just stand there it is was defiantly the best part about this zoo ps i suggest you grab a map if you want to walk around if not take the train it makes certain stops,Negative
night-safari,one of the best experiences i have ever had at a zoo not many zoos offer access at night and this is a unique experience to see take the tram around to get an up close experience with the animals something different at night walking around the zoo with limited visibility to everything going on around you and hearing the animals come alive as night moves on,Positive
night-safari,i have been to zoos during the day so hearing of the night safari definitely made a mark on my calendar taking from the word night this sanctuary is definitely for the nocturnal animal species pedator and pray alike we decided to get the ticket with a tram access which happened to be a smart move when we saw what we were dealing with the safari does not enclose the animals in cage like barriers there are slim to none barriers so tour guides make it a point to provide us some pointers on how to go about within the sanctuary it also includes no flash photography so if you are looking to immortalize your experience on film just bring a cam corder that has a night mode and has a function to turn off that red dot that signals that you are recording when riding the tram we have an option to alight at whatever stop we want to further explore the area on foot but if you are a bit sketchy about staying n the tram may not be a good idea i find this experience absolutely exciting mainly because all the action happens at night and if you want to get the most out of it enjoy the show exhibiting some of the nocturnal animals that appeals you starting with the gray wolf,Positive
night-safari,i have to give it five stars for novelty value but i have to admit that i expected so much more pro trip leave the camera at home you wo not get any decent photos despite having all your professional gear the tram ride goes so fast just pointing out what animals are on your left and on your right on crowded day there are four people in a row so you can only see things on one side of the tram it so dark that you cannot always spot the animals in time before the tram moves away i did see the hippo going crazy snapping away which might have been the only activity of the night you mostly see silhouettes of whatever animal the zoo claims to be there post tram ride you are allowed to walk through the safari but only on dedicated trails monitored by workers much to my dismay i was not able to go visit the hippo or the elephant exhibits again you get to walk through the smaller caged animal exhibits do it once some animals are nocturnal so you may be witness something you wo not be able to see in other zoos like a hippo that is actually active it will be dark out there so set your expectations correctly,Negative
night-safari,my husband and i went here about  years ago and i remembered it being so much more extensive than it actually is there are really only  things to do here and the main attraction is the tram ride through the park it is cool to experience because the animals seem so close but we had a bunch of rowdy people on our tram that were loud and distracting so they killed the vibe of our tour it was good to check out but if you have gone once no need to go back,Positive
night-safari,a bit pricy but entertaining way to spend the night either with your significant other family kids or by yourself for the admission of sgd   you can hop on a tram ride see  different shows a fire show and a hosted nocturnal animal show and check out the self guided trails my only complaint this is just me being picky but for the sake of safety animal welfare i completely understand why it is located where it is at is the location the zoo is about  minutes driving time tip take uber from katong marine parade area just beware that this is a popular tourist attraction so you might want to get in earlier before the crowd does,Positive
night-safari,i brought my  friends from amsterdam to the night safari as i have heard excellent reviews about it and we were not let down the mystery and novelty of a night zoo is the most impressive factor live commentary is provided on board the tram which took us through the zoo to see animals natively found in himalayan foothills to wild equitorial africa the creatures of the night show is kid friendly with the zoo warden cracking a few jokes here and there get to see hyenas raccoons wolves and more nocturnal animals perform tricks note last admission is at pm admission tram adult s   child  to  years old s,Positive
night-safari,first timers to the night safari would yelp in glee as it might seem like a novelty the last time i have visited was  years ago i hardly remember much but that it was mostly dark now  years later i thought i would give it another go arm with my camera i was abit disappointed that my  year old memory was right it was so dark i could hardly get a decent picture best part of the visit was the creatures of the night show which was pretty entertaining think small furry raccoons scurrying around the stage otters trained to recycle and many more for a park veteran like myself i found the show quite hilarious too another best for me is the tram ride overall i sat on the tram  times one tram journey circling the park lasted for  mins i reckon its the best way to start and end the night safari as the tram brings you to view certain animals that you cannot otherwise see as there are no walking trails to enjoy the place fully come prepared with night vision goggles torchlight and mosquito patch something to share i asked the park guides whether night safari would turn off all the lights after the park closes at  midnight and i was amused that the answer was yes i guess the animals also know that when there are lights spotlights therefore it means showtimes lights out means its sleeping time how cute is that tip bring night vision goggles might help prevent any unnecessary falls cuts or bruises it also gives a unique perspective when viewing the animals,Positive
night-safari,the sleepy animals made me somewhat sleepy i also thought the place was overly crowded and the food was expensive i paid about   singaporean dollars for a hamburger and fries the animal show was great the presenter did an excellent job with all of the animals seemingly coming out when it was their turn even a raccoon showed how to manage and recycle waste properly now try to book this excursion in advance so you can be picked up and dropped off back at your hotel,Negative
night-safari,got a ticket for entrance at  pm not crowded at all on a monday night workers were pleasant and helpful but the overall experience was not that great for something that is labeled and marketed as a night safari the lighting was dismal very few animals were out or awake and so on lighting was so bad that some animals were there but you could not see them the tram car stopped at some exhibits and the first car could view what the recorded message was saying then they took off and we had to see the exhibit as it passed by after the message and poof the exhibit was gone again usually an empty exhibit or animals in shadows if you go at night do not waste your money go early before dark and it may be better we guess we wo not be back for the price they completely underperformed,Negative
night-safari,bottom line the experience does not live up to the hype a relatively small zoo and not really much to see if you are a nature lover and would really love to have a memorable encounter with wild animals go for a safari in africa that should blow your mind,Negative
night-safari,with very little time to spend in singapore and plenty of options we decided to do the night safari as it is not an experience one can do at any zoo safari park we first skipped the fire show to beat the crowds and find a seat for the nocturnal animals show all  of us were pleasantly surprised that the show was enjoyable we feared it might be too circus like at the expense of the animals special mention to the recycling otters very cute then we decided to visit the different paths on foot but there is also the possibility to jump on a safari train we were able to view all the nocturnal animals in our own pace and when we were tired enough we decided to go on the train it was definitely a unique educational and fun experience that i recommend to all visitors to singapore also a taxi from downtown should cost about  so despite being out of town the night safari is very accessible be prepared for the queue to get a taxi at the end though,Positive
night-safari,where else in the world can you experience anything like this answer nowhere i showed up pretty darn late to the night safari on a  day stop in singapore something like  pm when some of the other exhibits were closed but i barely managed to make it onto the very last night safari car it is freaking awesome i never knew the jungle could be so alive at night there were plenty of animals in each exhibit and a surprising amount of activity strange ungulates and nocturnal primates and flying creatures galore definitely one of the highlights of my trip i should go earlier next time so i can see some of the other exhibits i missed out on some kind of show theater thing minor cons it is hard to take night pictures,Positive
night-safari,really one for the kids main grouse here is that at night it is too low light to take photos and you cannot really use flash as they are afraid you will blind the animals so might as well just come here with the intention of sightseeing there are long queues for the creatures of the night show which is pretty lame imho and if you want to go watch be prepared to get to the show venue about half an hour earlier so that you can grab decent seats that allow for a good glimpse of the whole arena the walking trails are quite fun but it can get quite warm and humid especially in singapore weather come dressed lightly but with lots of mosquito patches and insect repellent,Positive
night-safari,this was my first time going to the night safari but i have been to the singapore zoo a couple of times and many other zoos over the years i really enjoyed the night safari wow that animals were out and moving about at night the tram ride was very enjoyable but a bit canned it do allow you to get very close to many animals and see others who were out and about there was also the opportunity to walk a trail that leads around the zoo to show other animals not visible form the tram i thought it was great fun walking in the dark through a jungle with all the animals about very cool the only draw back from me was that it was pretty crowded at the beginning long wait to get into the park and get on the trams i would recommend waiting a bit after the park opens so you do not have to wait in the long line at the beginning also no flash photos are allowed so if you have a camera or video camera with night vision ability that would help you out a lot i tried both a small mm camera and my cell phone camera without flash and found they could not do much with the low lighting i would recommend the night safari to anyone interested taxi is the best way to get in and out the bus does not appear to run directly to the mrt station good luck,Positive
night-safari,this was a must see for my family is trip to singapore i would have given it a five star had we not had to cut our visit short due to the pouring rain this place is across the street from the singapore zoo the way this place works is that we buy a combo ticket for the singapore zoo and the night safari when the zoo closes we head across the street and get in line to go to the safari be sure to get in line early as there are a lot of bus loads of people coming in you really want to beat this crowd or prepare to wait and wait in line once in you wait in another line of course to get on the tram that takes you around the zoo where you keep an eye out for animals while the commentator is giving information when the tram ride ends you can now tour the park on foot anyway when we went it rained hard we were lucky though because we were able to get on the first tram the rain was just starting when we got off the tram we wanted to see the tiger feeding that i read about in my guide book and asked one of the workers well that is when heavier rain started and it continued needless to say we were unable to see the tiger feeding to our utter disappointment we ended up leaving the park earlier and caught a bus back to our hotel it was a bit disappointing to not have been able to tour the park on foot but there is not much you can do when mother nature decides to shed some serious tears i would definitely recommend the night safari though it certainly is a very cool concept,Positive
night-safari,we bought tickets for this at changi airport at one of those changi recommends shops while there was not any discounts on the ticket they did include the tram which we highly recommend the tram covers a lot of areas of the park quickly and will get you pretty close to some of the animals as they will not be behind a fence and can get right up to the tram animals are a little hard to see in the dark but overall it was a good experience,Positive
night-safari,it is a night safari where else can you do this i will tell you no where the concept is incredible you get to see all the animals that are sleeping at a normal zoo because they are noctural you first take a ride around the park then you can walk around the park and enjoy other animals and partake in things like the bat cave which you cannot do on the ride remember it is dark with minimal lighting and the animals can surprise you with how close they are to you i will remember this for the rest of my life,Positive
night-safari,we had a great experience there so beautiful and exciting i had never been before in zoo at night little bit scary i felt like indiana jones,Positive
night-safari,i loved the night safari the only issue with it is that a big chunk of the park is closed for walking you can only see it on the tram tour seeing animals up and about being much more active than during the day was great i was not expecting it to be much of anything how great can a zoo be but it is worth the trip from downtown,Positive
night-safari,one of the most unique experiences i have had while traveling abroad and in singapore it is a great break from the malls i highly suggest any visitor to follow suggested itinerary  on the website nightsafari com sg visit and you will not feel it is worth it if you only take the trolley you must walk the trails,Positive
night-safari,though quite touristy it is a place worth going as you can see animals in their natural surrounding at a time when they are regularily active the bats are spectacular avoid the noisy entrance shows,Positive
night-safari,the night safari should be top of your to do list because it is a really exciting experience for kids and adults alike you should not be put off by the fact that it is at night or that you might not be able to see everything because you can it is so incredible how near to the animals you are but its all very safe because there are huge fences and you are secure in the moving buggy type vehicle that takes you on your tour around the safari park although it is quite a long tour the time really does fly and the kids definitely wo not get bored because they is so much for them to look at and be engaged in,Positive
night-safari,the night safari experience in singapore was one of my favorite places i visited on a round the world trip it is suitable for adults and children alike it was great to see the animals in a more natural setting than most zoos i have visited in the world the roar of the lion as you are walking through the trees in the dark is amazing it was fairly busy when we got there although it was sucha big place that it did not feel too crowded,Positive
night-safari,the night safari is an interesting take on a standard zoo it is an opportunity to see the nocturnal animals you normally miss it can get quite warm and there is a lot of walking so bring water and do not bother with a camera most animals are too far away the the light is too low,Positive
night-safari,this has to be the number one attraction in singapore and is regularly voted one of the best experiences in the world and for once it is not a load of old hype it deserves its reputation singapore zoo opens during the day and is a fantastic place to wander around the landscaping is such that there are no bars or cages but rather natural obstacles to keep animals and humans apart this means you can get very close to the animals and see then in all their glory at night a different section of the zoo opens so it is worth going and seeing both you wo not be repeating yourself again this is an amazing concept the whole night zoo is bathed in floodlight to mimic moonlight a small tram can take you around the zoo but if you prefer you can walk if you take the tram you can get off at stops and wander around to see the animals more closely if you are walking the paths are clearly signposted and there are plenty of helpers to ensure you do not stray fire dancers provide regular performances in the main reception area and there are a number of decent restaurants and cafes serving food and drinks a couple of things to note it gets very busy in the evening with coach loads of tour groups and parties skip the tram and walk on foot it is quieter and just as fun take plenty of insect repellent if you are prone to getting bitten you can get to and from the zoo easily on the bus which goes from various locations around the city you can always get a taxi back if you do not feel like waiting there are always some waiting,Positive
night-safari,a must do for every tourist in singapore i have not met a visitor who has said that night safari does not live up to hype and expectations so do pay this a visit you can get package admissions together with the singapore zoo which will make the deal sweet the singapore zoo is right next to the night safari,Negative
night-safari,having lived in singapore for ten years i have visited this place many times the night safari is a zoo experience like no other it can get a bit busy and the entry cost is not cheap however the experience is worth it a great experience for children and adults the park is clean educational and remember you just hop on the open air coaches and you are driven around the park there are also some really great shows you might want to look out for on their website for the appropriate times,Positive
night-safari,we had a fantastic evening at the night safari closest you will ever get to a natural habitat for captive animals everything explained well by knowledgeable staff and good signage like most things in singapore the night safari was really well organized and thought out we were not going to bother with the show but glad we did as the presenter explained things well and it was obvious that she and everyone else really cared for the animals would recommend this to anyone visiting singapore,Positive
night-safari,you need to go in early for night safari as it is normally quite crowded i reckon singapore zoo is better as you have a longer time to sightsee but night safari is show is very interesting and entertaining with a very humorous host do drop by if you have time to spare and if you do fully utilise the time as there are quite a lot of places to see with limited opening hours,Positive
tim-ho-wan,had my lunch with my family at this place the restaurant had a nice dining ambience and staff greeted us friendly we tried a few items like the century egg congee crispy pork buns and chew cheong fun the pork buns are indeed worthy to be called their signature dish it was so flavourful and the visual was very enticing recommended to give this a try if you are craving for dim sum in singapore,Positive
tim-ho-wan,very good and affordable dim sum place if you come during tea time between lunch and dinner you get a wide selection of dishes for   which is a steal the chashabao is crafted beautifully crunchy sweet and also savory gotta love the combination of textured and flavors the shaomai and other dumplings do not skimp out on meat and shrimp and the flavor is very consistent throughout the dishes only downside is no outside drinks and that service can be a little rough at times also charging for hand towels seems a little too old fashioned and annoying,Positive
tim-ho-wan,my first time trying tim ho wan was in sydney three years ago and i fell in love instantaneously being from the usa i was super excited to see so many thw locations in singapore this one in citylink is the closest to marina bay sands where we were staying no wait for lunch surprisingly and our meal did not disappoint everything is so tasty but my two favorite things are the baked bbq pork bun and steamed egg cake so good that we ordered a second round for both the only thing that i would skip next time would be the egg tarts i have definitely had better elsewhere pricey for dim sum but completely worth it at least once in my opinion,Positive
tim-ho-wan,i went to tim ho wan for dim sum lunch i ordered a bunch of dishes so here are some highlights the prawn dumplings were pretty good the pork siewmai was very tasty the steamed egg cake is a nice light and fluffy consistency the pork rice rolls were fine the hong kong style egg tarts were some of the best i have had and the mango sago was refreshing the service speed is fast the prices are okay for this type of dim sum food there is a decent amount of seating though not as much as in most dim sum places overall tim ho wan has solid cantonese dim sum food i initially came here because i read that it got a michelin star but after eating there i did not feel like it was really that exceptional still if you are interested in tasty dim sum tim ho wan is a very good choice,Positive
tim-ho-wan,so i passed this place due to the iphone not giving good directions once i finally made all i can say was yummy i wondered the shrimp dumplings spinach and shrimp dumplings chicken spring rolls which are fried the fried milk custard and also the braised beef noodle soup everything was delicious i should have ordered more the only thing that i did not care for was the braised beef noodle soup it was not what i expect has far as flavor even when adding sauces to it it just was not tasty at all one michelin star of yummy greatness check it out,Negative
tim-ho-wan,one michelin star for an inexpensive dim sum restaurant alright this one was located just off the city hall mrt station in singapore and seemed to have the best rating and review on yelp i ordered a bunch of dishes with my niece and her friends and here it goes the bbq pork bun was baked not steamed but it was very good the bread layer was pretty thin and there was a substantial amount of bbq pork filling there was an air gap but it all just seemed to be in the right proportions the har gau or shrimp dumpling was also very good they had a small wonton noodle dish that was also good and they had these green skinned wonton like it was made from spinach in fact most of it compared very well with some of the best dim sum i have ever had maybe not a michelin star but close prices compared with those in california so no complaints i will be back again to try some of the other dishes go try it,Positive
tim-ho-wan,we had a light lunch today the fried rice veggie dumplings and shumai were good beyond our expectation service was really prompt and no gimmicks we got what we wanted at no time after lunch just brought the order sheet to the cashier and pay that is it really nice,Positive
tim-ho-wan,in  summer i lined up like everyone else did in front of the original tim ho wan in hong kong it got a michelin star that year dubbed as the cheapest michelin in fact i took the opportunity to try it one last time in  but ultimately it became an impossible task as the fan base was growing so it expanded i heard the new york outpost is lackluster but i do not get to come to singapore often enough and it is right inside the hotel so it felt appropriate to try it was a hot and humid  degree weather and i did not want to go outdoors turns out the place was half empty i got a nice seat and ordered what was popular the bbq pork buns the chicken feet the ribs etc try to stay carb free by eating the fillings only the verdict is that it is good but not as good as circa  in hong kong after its receipt of the michelin still i like my nostalgia and familiarity a good find,Negative
tim-ho-wan,suprised to see this michelin star dim sum at underground mrt walkway in singapore realized they have many locations their turnip cake was a serious disappointment it was pure white radish not hot and no toppings inside the famous bbq bun was good but a little too sweet salty good amount of filling,Negative
tim-ho-wan,really great dim sum place but then again they are famous for that the place is rather small since it is located inside a mall but the service is fast and so is table turnover we were lucky that we got a seat right away during a lunch rush hour everything on the table was delicious and satisfying great price and great dim sum,Positive
tim-ho-wan,ever since tim ho wan has opened in nyc i have always wanted to go but knew that there were always long lines so ironically enough i end up in singapore and realize that many of the globally recognized dim sum spots that are delicious tim ho wan too many din tai fungs to count appear to be here and this one being in the mall right next to the hotel we are staying it does not get any better than rolling out for breakfast right when tim ho wan opens at   am and there is no line or wait to speak of we got seated quickly our food came out quickly and while the service was not personable you are not coming here because you expect to be treated like a king i finally got to see what all the hype was about especially the pork buns holy cow is all i can say i have had some good pork buns and there is a really good cheap spot in nyc chinatown that i love but the buns here are by far the best i have had the roll is a little sweet but not that thick at all and the pork inside is deliciously savory if i had more time in singapore and more stomach space i would probably grab an order of these to go every day the rest of the dim sum was pretty good as well i particularly liked the pork ribs served in black bean sauce as the sauce was a much lighter version i was expecting the ribs to be drenched in a heavy marinade and made each bite less heavy but just as flavorful the bean curd skin was juicy and moist and the shumai was fresher and less dry than most other versions i have encountered elsewhere although the flavor was not necessarily any more distinctive in all i get the hype when it comes to the buns the rest of the food is quite good as well it is basically a more premium better prepared version of dim sum but if you can get in i understand why folks really love the food here and are willing to wait for it the takeout line here is a plus for sure in the event that you are on the go,Positive
tim-ho-wan,this is one of the better location of tim ho wan comparing to the ones in the states and vietnam the prices do not differ much at each place remaining quite reasonable and even low for such quality of food and service  years ago i got driven here by a taxi driver after asking for a good place for dim sum in singapore and was told it won a michelin star i was not disappointed at all the dishes were of good taste and high quality besides the basic dishes like har gow of shu mai their specialities are excellent my must order dish for every visit is the one i do not remember the name topped with wasabi sauce and roe sometimes they have seasonals and during winter time they made a delicious mini har gow dish made to be eaten with sichuan peppercorns sauce for such a famous and busy place food got served surprisingly quickly and still piping hot i definitely recommend everyone to check it out if you are a big fan of dim sum,Positive
tim-ho-wan,impressive line up of savory dim sum place is really good for a dim sum experience its one of the good dim sum places ive ever been,Positive
tim-ho-wan,food    service    value    decor    overall    the dim sum here was very good but not mind blowing the baked bbq pork buns in particular were very popular i thought they were good but not as much as some of the others at my table did try coming later in the day to avoid long lines look forward to trying the original s in hong kong that actually garnered the perhaps politicized m s,Positive
tim-ho-wan,the dim sum is good but the location is stark and the service is really poor it reminds me of a dirty middle school cafeteria think mash potatoes is lop and plop by the old woman with the hairnet all that is missing is the cigarette hanging from her mouth yet another example of what singapore is willing to tolerate for restaurant settings,Negative
tim-ho-wan,this is just a review for their pick up counter but yes it is awesome so good ordered the following bbq pork buns  buns   sgd pan fried carrot radish cake  pieces   beancurd skin w shrimp  rolls   hong kong style egg tart buy  get one free   i was walking through raffles place and just sat down on a bench and started eating because they do recommend that you eat the bbq buns within an hour boy am i glad i started eating early what is so outstanding about this dim sum is that the main ingredients really shine through in terms of flavor as amazing as the crust is for the bbq buns the pork is actually the star the radish flavor of the cakes were so noticeable in a good way that it make you feel like their radishes were fresh the beancurd skin was crispy and had a balanced amount of filling not too little nor too much just right that is when you know you have got good dim sum everything tastes just right no heavy feeling after eating it i basically ate all of that in an afternoon and felt fine,Positive
tim-ho-wan,cha siew bao must try the cha siew bao is so good that my gf get a nose bleed when she eats it so get those tissues ready the pork liver vermicelli roll is pretty good but personally i think something is missing in there the next best favourite would be the chicken feet tender and fat well marinated and tasty down to the bones we had the chew siew noodles and the glutinous rice both fills the tummy with its sizeable portion the tonic medlar jelly dessert with wolfberries is a delight  for two pax reasonable,Positive
tim-ho-wan,well i loveeeeeee eating at tim ho wan only if there is no queue this is the th outlet in singapore and i chanced upon it while on my way to another restaurant which i gave up no queue during weekend dinner hour yay surprised to see new additions on the menu at this outlet that is pretty much adjusted to fit local taste buds laksa wanton and chilli crab taro dumpling we ordered   of their  big  heavenly kings baked bbq pork bun and pork liver vermicelli roll pork congee and century egg salted egg beancurd skin with shrimp and chilli crab taro dumpling we enjoyed every dish we ordered except for the beancurd skin with shrimp we really enjoy pork liver cooked just right something that is really hard to find in singapore consistency of those baked bbq pork bun which they maintained for all their franchise stalls well balanced pork congee that is not too salty and that really tasty chilli crab taro dumpling that is fried perfectly with a punch of fire after the chilli crab gets down to my stomach i felt that there was no need for any sauces throughout the meal the beancurd skin with shrimp the fried dish not to be confused with the steamed version was a little disappointing for me though as it is too oily not at least served on an oil filter paper very little shrimp and the texture is rather mushy and the portion is small i would have opt for the option of beancurd skin with pork and shrimp instead the steamed version totally not worth  for those  tiny pieces this outlet has password protected wifi but when i asked the staff he mentioned that they are not make known the password to the wifi so dang no wifi here paid about  for this meal to satisfy  tummy it is still worth it for the great quality of the food and services,Positive
tim-ho-wan,the dim sum was pretty tasty and perfectly cooked except for the ya chow fried rice which was bland,Positive
tim-ho-wan,great dim sum fast efficient service the pork buns were probably the best i have had has a fast food feel to it but very attentive wait staff,Positive
tim-ho-wan,only giving this place a  star and not  because it is not traditional dim sum i am use to they hand you a sheet and you order from it the dim sum was okay not the best i have had nor the worst it was nice for a quick snack in between meals,Negative
tim-ho-wan,below my expectation the publicity and popularity created high expectation and affects my review i would say the food is okay,Negative
tim-ho-wan,this was my first visit to tim ho wan and i can say holy moley this place is as good as people say the people next to me were kind enough to see my total confusion on what to order and pointed me to a few signatures and they were spot on the bbq pork buns the vermicelli with liver and the gloutinous rice all fantastic and how cheap is this place i left paying only  including a drink and paid with my amex one has just opened up here in melbourne i am going tomorrow just pure awesome check them out,Positive
tim-ho-wan,known for it is world renowned baked buns with bbq pork and the steamed egg cake this dim sun restaurant boast a menu with an exciting array of dishes like the pork shrimp siew mai prawn dumplings glutinous rice with lotus leaf etc the menu now also includes new dishes suited to our local taste buds like the chilli crab taro dumplings and the laksa wonton overall all the dishes served here are well prepared by experience dim sum chefs and is of very high quality tried their baked buns with bbq pork and all i can say was it was excellent the bun was soft and flavorful and the pork was very tasty baked buns with bbq pork,Positive
tim-ho-wan,tim ho wan has great food the shuo mai is so flavorful and delicious the pi guat is my favorite it is so flavorful and i like the sauce that comes with it to the service is good but the restaurant is very busy if you go to tim ho wan be prepared to wait in line but overall i would highly recommend tim ho wan to anybody that likes dim sum,Positive
tim-ho-wan,i mean it is perfect great steamed pork buns,Positive
tim-ho-wan,some of the best dim sum i have ever had i am still dreaming about the bbq pork buns,Positive
tim-ho-wan,can never go wrong with the bbq baked buns and the glutenous rice in lotus leaves they are the only  items on the menu i stop in to do a take away,Positive
tim-ho-wan,finally got to dine in at tim ho wan ordered the baked bun with bbq pork pan fried carrot cake pork dumpling with shrimp prawn dumpling and osmanthus cake loving the baked bun with bbq pork and the osmanthus cake the food are all delicious but i feel that this two are the best the baked bun with bbq pork is a must try one of the famous item here interested in osmanthus cake because of those drama that i watched in younger days this jelly is really sweet and nice their service are good too the water will be refill whenever you wanted will be back to try for more,Positive
tim-ho-wan,same great food without the wait i was pleasantly surprised the bbq pork buns are the bomb i chowed down  of them in a single breath,Positive
mrs-pho,sugar cane prawns     starsit tasted a bit too sweet and artificial as if they used those frozen prawn balls instead of fresh or frozen prawns cockles stir fried with garlic and lard     starsnot my thing i find cockles kind of smelly and pungent but my friends loved it sliced beef noodle soup  starsgood pho not sure which beef pho dish we got but it was delicious the soup was flavoured just right the noodles had the right texture and the beef was not too tough stir fried beef noodle with lemongrass     starsmy least favourite of the noodle dishes we had the beef was too dry and tough and there was not anything else in the dish to make up for that special beef combination noodle soup  starsnot sure which bun dish we got it had spring rolls and meat balls the meat balls were amazing soft juicy and flavourful the best vietnamese food i have had in singapore nam nam is got nothing on this,Positive
mrs-pho,caught some pho on a rainy day pho was delicious spring rolls were good too service was awful walked in when there was only one other customer who left shortly after we arrived the entire staff was enjoying their lunch while we had to walk halfway up to them to ask to order ask to pay and everything else in between bathroom is disgusting not sure how this place has so many good reviews but we were not impressed although the food was good it did not make up for the staff also beware they charge extra for napkins and water and cash only,Negative
mrs-pho,just mediocre vietnamese food appetizers pho more i have given this place several chances and i am just over it there are much better places in town that are worth your cravings meh,Negative
mrs-pho,went there and waited at the table for  minutes waiting for a waiter to come and take our order turns out that you have to pay first before you can eat they charge for tissues and they only serve bottled water grumpy cashier and manager walked out without eating wont be going back again,Positive
mrs-pho,great location for sightseeing near arab st and good pho bo tai and papaya salad reasonable prices fast service what is not to like june,Positive
mrs-pho,stopped here on my way home from the office asked for a beer no beer no problem i asked for a cup of water with my pho was told only mineral water available i left and went elsewhere,Positive
mrs-pho,i did not try the pho but we did get quite the selection of appetizers which were all phenomenal yum i would definitely go back and recommend to anyone good prices too,Positive
mrs-pho,this review is mainly for the crab noodles because it is my favorite thing on the menu the pho is good but not as good as these crab noodles yum the line here on weekends can get quite insane but i arrived at pm and held on to my table for dear life service is efficient but they were quite confused with our orders as we constantly placed new orders instead of placing one at one go i guess they are more used to people who show up to eat and leave and not us grazing types the fresh roll is not my favorite but i quite liked the meatballs they are nice and juicy and come with a delicious dipping sauce but enough distractions let me talk about the crab noodles unlike pho they come with mee tai mak which is a kind of short rice noodle and is super slippery and look like little tails as a result you have to scoop them up with a spoon inhaling all that delicious broth along the way the soup is like a super jazzed up version of pho broth with all the added umami delightfulness of crab and seafood the bowl is generously topped with crab pork meatballs as well as some shrimp i literally inhaled the entire bowl in one go and had barely anything left for my companions who wanted to try it oops i would go back again just for my favorite crab noodles i have also tried the bun and pho which are good but pale in comparison to those crabby savory delicious noodles,Positive
mrs-pho,came here as a tourist from america and was thoroughly disappointed the waitresses and owner were just outright rude and yelled at us for asking for some lime we asked for waters as well and they rolled their eyes and walked away from us food was not very good either and they tried charging us more than what we ordered thinking we were tourist and unaware would not recommend this place to anyone looking for,Negative
mrs-pho,pros good food food arrives quick nice interior cool menu with pictures affordable cons rude af waitresses what are you doing thai iced tea is all ice ask for a cold one without ice or you will be paying s   for a glass of ice pho was very average go somewhere with better service the menu and interior were the most redeeming parts of this restaurant,Positive
mrs-pho,excellent food good prices fast service we enjoyed it so much we even came back a second time,Positive
mrs-pho,i was excited to read the glowing reviews of this place and got my expectations high i grew up eating pho in canada both toronto and vancouver where you just cannot miss the numerous pho restaurants dotting the cities so my standard of good pho is what you get from any pho place in north america there is just no bad pho over there and it is a staple food in every vietnamese family there first off the chairs are most uncomfortable the stools are too high for me to eat off the table easily i felt i was bending over double just to eat and i am a short person then the combination of air conditioning and fan going gives two types of temperature you get the cool air followed by a blast of warm air it is most disconcerting i ordered the sliced beef and brisket pho with extra beef balls the soup is tasty though i wish it also comes with a side plate of bean sprouts and basil and slice chili and lime for customer to add to it the meat is terrible i cannot see or taste the brisket at all and the meat is very chewy and tough such a big disappointment the beef ball is good though i cannot tell if it is handmade or from a machine the summer tea takes some getting used to i will suggest to stick to the vietnamese coffee or something the service is good though bring cash i do not remember if it accept nets definitely no credit card facility here at the moment i think pho tam anh at chinatown point is better for pho,Negative
mrs-pho,best pho in singapore hands down what dish do i reccomend everything most of the soups and noodles i have eaten here are great i love going with friends and ordering different ones to share,Positive
mrs-pho,food taste authenticprice reasonable market rate chicken beef pho sgd  ambience just like typical vietnamese restaurant but just half a shop so very noisy and crowded seating just stool non back support so have to finish fast and leave not suitable for pregnancy woman and children tips avoid weekend especially saturday the soup finish by pm yet the shop close at pm so everyone do not get any soup based stuff except asam soup based in the picture and spicy beef soup bbq pork rice and dry vermicelli still available no tax gst but charges  for service charge the usual charges service charge but had to go to counter to pay bill so the only service they do is to bring your order to your table does not justify the  service charge,Negative
mrs-pho,salad was good spring roll sticking to each other pho was average am i crazy service was fine no rudeness to be detected if you like a hipster vibe over food this is for you,Negative
mrs-pho,this place has almost reached cult status with singaporeans it often runs out of ph in the late afternoon early evening so we wanted to try it out the ph broth is pretty flavourful but it is not served piping hot as it should be the is pecial version only has beef brisket and beef balls but no raw beef or tripes and the beef brisket is rather chewy the mini clams is cooked with a delightful garlic sauce and served with sinful but scrumptious lard the chicken wings are below average venturing to the toilet shows how unhygienic part of the back section is next time we would try newly opened ph c hai on the same block of beach road or stick to long phng in joo chiat which is much better more authentic and with a more diverse longer menu,Negative
mrs-pho,this is probably a   star place so i will round up for generosity hailing from melbourne with a massive vietnamese population and having had two vietnamese ex girlfriends my judgements of vietnamese food are always benchmarked against what i have had back home which means i am usually disappointed here in singapore we ordered pho special dac biet vietnamese assam laksa some goi cuon fresh rice paper rolls and a couple of drinks the goi cuon was good fresh with a great sauce pho was good probably best i have had so far in sg but still not melbourne good of course it was a damn sight better than the ridiculously overhyped overrated and overpriced namnam it was missing the depth and roundness of flavour that i love about pho generous with meats though i missed the bits of vietnamese sausage tripe and beef tendons that i have come to expect the assam laksa was a bit unusual complex flavours i was not a fan service was good friendly and fast  for two of us tables are literally   inches apart from each other so not the most pleasant ambience overall worth a try i just hope people stop going to namnam,Positive
mrs-pho,i would say bn tht nng is way better than nam nam i would prefer to have more herbs than cucumber though chicken pho also delicious with lotsa herbs soup is full of flavor vietnamese coffee was just ok not fragrant enough i love the small table outside the shop with stools so much like how the locals eat by the roadside in vietnam all in all food is pretty authentic and value for money,Positive
mrs-pho,great place to stop for lunch if you have limited time excellent pho quick service and friendly staff,Positive
mrs-pho,legitimately the best pho i have had in sg sample size of about  places definitely recommend standard pho fresh spring rolls and the lemonade always packed on a not so busy location so it has to be gud update do not get adventurous here the best thing on the menu is the pho trust me if you need more stick to spring rolls i have tried several items now although instill need to sample the chicken wings,Positive
mrs-pho,very good pho neat atmosphere sassy but good service came for lunch on a saturday and was very pleased the coffee was great both hot and iced the spring rolls were delicious and the pho very very good i do not recall the name of the one i ordered but had brisket in it and i ate every bit of it will definitely return note they only take cash,Positive
mrs-pho,the best and most authentic vietnamese food in town the broth of the pho is excellent i recommend the braised beef version the spring roles with pork and shrimp are a must have they are well complemented by the sauce you may need to ask for more sauce the food was served very quickly and the decor was interesting will go back again as i hear the meatballs are amazing more to come,Positive
mrs-pho,their pho is goooood the place is tiny industrial cool dim in a hip kind of way and that kind of squished that makes you feel real cozy with your companions and all the people a table over food was really quite delicious try the chicken wings and beef balls too watch out when it comes to drinks though i found the salty lemonade a little too salty and sour for my taste and the iced tea is a cooling herbal kind definitely come before  if you do not want to wait  for a sizable bowl of pho mrs pho is here for your next pho vietnamese noodle craving,Positive
mrs-pho,one of my favorite vietnamese restaurants it has character and it is authentic love the beef broth there is also chicken options for non beef eaters must go,Positive
mrs-pho,first time to mrs pho on a weekday lunch and the place was packed but people were leaving and we got a table very quickly food order is easy write your own order sheet which is available on the table and then proceed to the counter to place them very soon after our pho arrived though i would have preferred to have our starter of papaya salad come first it came a bit later we ordered the simple beef pho   my personal benchmark of a good pho to be really honest there was hardly any beefy aroma when the bowl hit the table taste wise brothwas rather mild as well i am used to a stronger beefy broth and would have liked more than the couple of token mint leaves and herbs to add more aromatics oh well a squirt of hoisin and hot sauce and a squeeze of calamansi lime were added in an attempt to lift up the taste better but still short of what is good nonetheless i do appreciate this more than nam nam is version which i feel uses lots of artificial seasonings the papaya salad was very good though just papaya a few shrimps and a good dressing and topping of shredded pork fried onions and crushed peanuts  the table for two pax is rather small given that all the condiments are provided which is a good thing and convenient but do take up a bit of space our  bowls of noodles  drinks and  appetizer took up every area,Positive
mrs-pho,best pho in singapore i have been to nam nam which did not impress and mrs pho takes me back to vietnam and all the vietnamese restaurants in the us the place is not big i did not make reservations but only had to wait   minutes for a table to open up we ordered the following and they were all delicious hanoi meatballs great sauceschicken wings in fish sauce perfect crispinesssliced beef brisket noodle soup pho yummy vermicelli with pork spring roll can do with more pork,Positive
mrs-pho,dear mrs pho you are my strength when i am weakyou are my voice when i cannot speakyou are my eyes when i cannot seeyou see the best there is in melift me up when i cannot reachyou give me faith cause you believei am everything i ambecause you love mehappy mother is day by far the best pho in singapore food must try beef combo pho will update with more visits service fast do not expect much elsecost   per pax cash only overall fast dining good food best alone or any size group busy so go during non peak hours,Positive
mrs-pho,when i am in need of a comforting bowl of vietnamese pho i would naturally head to long phung in joo chiat for that warming noodles in beef broth i have never been disappointed by their bowl but it is always good to have a backup in case they are closed or when i am not near the east so here is another trusted alternative mrs pho mrs pho has been on my food list for a bit because it has been recommended by trusted foodie friends like miss tam chiak and superfinefeline so after several half baked attempts to visit despite being in the area jr and i finally dropped by for a taste test standard side order of goi cuon   for  thin and chewy rice paper rolls filled with rice vermicelli slices of prawn and pork belly paired with that chee cheong fun sauce now on to the star their pho have the pho bo tai   sliced beef noodle soup or the pho dac biet   special beef combination noodle soup the former is a no frills bowl that comes with thin and tender beef slices while the latter has meatballs brisket beef and a half cooked egg i thought the beef balls were very authentic and indeed they are freshly shipped from vietnam weekly as compared to long phung we think that mrs pho does a more delicate bowl of noodles with milder flavors of course you can always spice it up with the accompanying fish sauce lime and chili if you are not for beef there is also pho ga   chicken noodle soup and bun mam   assam seafood noodle soup and other vermicelli and rice dishes start or end your meal at mrs pho with the iced ca phe sua da  i thought it was rather smooth and not too sweet really the avocado smoothie   was decent too now i know where to head to for a perk me up in the bugis area a good ca phe sua da is so hard to come by in singapore and of course the pho come here if you cannot take joo chiat is grittiness mrs pho is definitely more for the young hipsters,Positive
mrs-pho,i wish this place could be next to my house ordered a bun spring rolls both were superb flew all the way from the us to try this place as it happened to be close to my hotel did not have time to go back wish i got to try more stuff from the menu,Negative
mrs-pho,great and popular place for vietnamese food need to go early or some dishes get sold out quickly the queue takes a while and we were unlucky that some customers in the place next door were smoking heavily nevertheless the food was worth the wait the lemongrass drink was refreshing the pho with soup was very tasty and my friends were pleasantly surprised by how addictive the cockles were definitely value for money and worth repeat visits,Positive
mrs-pho,for some reason pho tastes different in singapore versus the states this place is better than others in the city but i found the broth lacking in overall depth of flavor the pho dax biet was   and came with a small side bowl of broth with a partially cooked egg in it i thought that was strange the staff is quick to take your order and usher you out napkins are  cents extra overall i would return but do not expect pleasantries or any sort of customer service,Negative
mrs-pho,it is fresh fast good and with reasonable prices what else mrs pho is one of the only places to serve up legitimate pho and some of the classics dishes like papaya salad the semi hidden restaurant is small but beautiful in a post industrial decor nothing complicated just enough to feel like going back if you are coming for lunch do not be surprised to queue the place is often crowded from  to pm,Positive
mrs-pho,passing through beach road and hungry for some lunch was how i came across mrs pho i was greeted with the sound of people slurping their pho and distinctive vietnamese chatter from the staff great start additionally it was   in the afternoon and the place was packed although the pho appears to be the must try i was craving a rice plate so i went with the com suon cha before i even get to the food i just want to say that i was surprised to see how reasonably priced the items were nothing over  and the bowls of pho i see coming out of the kitchen all looked huge anyway on to my food the pork eggs and the vietnamese ham combo all blended in real well portion was just the right size you wo not come out overly full i also opted for a fresh spring roll appetizer i will have you check out the pictures for yourselves it was real authentic and took me back to vietnam and san jose hahaha my only complaint i wish the would add more items as i am sure mrs pho would make them so well apart from the food i liked the decor of the restaurant very rustic and modern in keeping with the interior design of most places around haji lane i will definitely come back here and review the pho,Positive
mrs-pho,tasty food at a reasonable price especially for this area   if it is just for the food however have experienced poor service almost every time whether dining in or calling in to order takeout if only there was some way of getting the food without having to interact with the staff storefront,Positive
mrs-pho,stars for the good food but minus a star for the service as one gets the impression that they want you to eat as quickly as possible and leave,Positive
mrs-pho,this used to be my go to place for authentic pho in the town a year ago i would have given it  stars but the standard has dropped the beef pho pho ga and bun are just ok sometimes the pho broth is tasteless but it is still better than the overhyped nam nam some things never change and those are the starters sides the chicken wings beef balls and fried spring rolls are pretty good and i lurve the cockles they say it is fried in garlic but really it is half a piglet of lard the fresh spring rolls are hit and miss this place can very crowded during dinner best to go before pm after pm many items might be sold out eating there is not the most comfortable chairs are too high for the table so your back will hurt if you linger and they have this annoying habit of forcing  people to sit at two top even when the restaurant is not crowded tables are small with the sauces cutlery pho bowls side dishes and drinks you practically need to sit at another table to eat but hey rules are rules cash only no booze on the menu but i have seen the owners break out some tiger around closing,Positive
mrs-pho,word all i am ma say is do not come here it is crowded enough go away kthx this place is a legit vietnamese run and vietnamese filled noodle shop it is basically a kopitiam but with air conditioning complete with tables so close you can hear your neighbor slurp i came in at  pm on a friday and every dish on the first page of the order chit was sold out except the chicken pho which also got crossed out after we ordered the last  bowls not going to say much more shhhhhh,Negative
mrs-pho,best vietnamese food i have tried in singapore the coconut smoothie is unusual and the best i have ever had anywhere the dry vermicelli is excellent arrive early because this place is packed at lunch time definitely great value for your,Positive
mrs-pho,never thought i would be a fan of vietnamese cuisine until my colleague brought me here i never liked soup and it is quiet rare to find vietnamese restaurant that serves many varieties in their menu other than pho and banh mi here my fav dish is their pork chop and their spring rolls i eat here at least once a week for lunch with my colleague to avoid long queue and if you come with a big group of people come at  sharp or even before then,Positive
mrs-pho,the packed every night little place says it all does not it the food is very affordable super awesome setting totally casually and pretty darn authentic too the pho what more to say almost as good as what i had in the streets of vietnam the fresh spring rolls were delicious and disappeared into the depths of my tummy pretty quickly i love the glazed wings juicy and tasty the drinks could improve coffee was not great and could be better but meh was not a huge deal service with a smile and all at a good price it is all good be prepared to wait for a seat guys,Positive
mrs-pho,love the pho and spring roll make sure you come ahead of time before the queue formed,Positive
mrs-pho,coming from la it is very hard to lower my standard for vietnamese food forget about namnam what is up with the long lines every single day i should say this place has the best pho in singapore there is not much space in this cute restaurant but you can expect awesome ambience with nice hippie deco around every corner super authentic and original nearest mrt nicoll highway it is along the shophouses across sultan plaza and opposite of concourse building avoid lunch and dinner time to prevent yourself from having to wait to be seated best to come after  or before  i will be back,Positive
mrs-pho,excellent food casual and nice ambience with some quirky details in its interior we ordered pho dac biet and two starters and they are so fulfilling located not far from the hip hj lane arab st it is a nice option when you are in the neighborhood,Positive
mrs-pho,this is a great place for street food style viet it is cosy and very homely the pho and soups were great definitely will come back,Positive
mrs-pho,do not tell your friends about this place just kidding this place is packed on weekdays come by noon for lunch if you want to get a seat and not have to wait in the queue the pho was delicious the noodles and the broth were excellent i wish there were more greens basil mint with the pho i am not sure why there were not more aside important question i have had pho in other places usually overseas but at actual vietnamese run small shops and often you get a whole plate of greens and taugey to add or is this a vietnamese american thing i have had actual vietnamese people tell me conflicting things is it a regional thing if you are vietnamese from vietnam and can explain this please tell me,Negative
mrs-pho,decent pho may not be like the pho back home but decent the most important part of pho is the soup it was alittle sweet but every one has a different taste the spring and summer rolls are good but i think the chicken wings are awesome portion are alittle small for guys if your a dude and extremely hungry you might want to order a second dish or pho as a back up,Positive
mrs-pho,i did not like the food as much as i would hoped it does not feel as authentic as lung phung in joo chiat but if you do not want to hike to the east maybe it is the best available option the space is cute though it try to emulate street eating in an air conditioned environment we do see vietnamese eating there so it may be more authentic than the other vietnamese chain stores in the city,Positive
mrs-pho,what a pleasure surprise this was the best pho i have ever had the broth was packed with so much flavor we went around pm so there was not a big crowd it was also when the staff was eating their lunch made by the kitchen you know food is good when their own staff eats there pho were   to   in price and the portions are great be sure to check this place out,Positive
mrs-pho,amazing food i came here with a friend and we ordered the beef pho special spicy mango spring rolls star fruit juice and an avocado smoothie the pho was delicious you get a lot for what you pay for the spring rolls were fresh and bigger than i expected they come with a peanut sauce the avocado smoothie was tasty i wanted to try star fruit juice and the spicy mango out of curiosity and was not in love but if you already like those things i am sure they are good i would strongly recommend this place if you are looking for pho for a very reasonable price we ordered two entrees two appetizers and three drinks for s  and gratuity was included,Positive
mrs-pho,fantastic the fried pork spring rolls and meatball appetizers were great i had the sliced beef pho while a little bland initially it is was spectacular when i added a little extra siracha and soy which i prefer to it having been to salty or spicy to begin with also the flavor increased as the steak cooked into the broth my friend had the spicy beef soup something i did not try it but he seemed quite happy my other friend had the beef noodle stir fry which i did taste and i think it is the best vietnamese stir fry i have had which is quite high praise as i would never consider ordering something besides pho at a vietnamese place until now prices were good a little under  for all three of us with several appetizers and drinks etc all left full and happy,Positive
mrs-pho,first off the decor is awesome it really reminds me of an upscale hipster version of vietnam from the rotating fans to the short stools it has a really authentic street feel everything was good but not great the one thing i really dislike is that their soups do not come with any fresh herbs that is the best part of vietnamese food piling on the bean sprouts thai basil mint you dont get any of that here a breakdown of my meal spring rolls good except the noodles were way too overcooked and tasted like mush but aside from that loved the shrimp and the peanut sauce green mango really traditional literally just green mango with chili powder i enjoyed it but someone that did not grow up eating it might find it underwhelming or odd pho dac biet just ok i really wish the broth was richer and more flavorful i ended up adding a lot of lime fish sauce and peppers to compensate bun bo i actually enjoyed this dish i think it could have used a little more shrimp paste but overall i thought it was good but my biggest issue is that it was missing a lot of traditional ingredients no cha no pigs blood no cabbage this place is authentic vietnamese adjacent however i have not had too much vietnamese food in sg but from what i hear this is probably close to as good as it will get so for that i will be back,Positive
mrs-pho,the traditional fare at mrs pho may be a little clunky but had a rustic homestyled authenticity to it and although a squishy tiny place service is speedy friendly and helpful our dishes arrived barely  minutes after orders were taken in quick succession we ate  cha gio  lovely chunky texture with wonderfully juicy porky flavours  nem nuong   decent but failed to leave an impression in light of the most amazeballs minced patties in hanoi just earlier this year  pho ga   delicate enough but missing in richness of depth a tip is to ask for extra lashings of basil and mint essential in making it all come alive  bun bo hue   a hot and spicy beef noodle soup laden with stewed beef that was so so and a fantastic vietnamese ham bun bo xao sa   chilled rice noodles tossed in a peanut onion dressing and topped with beef slices stir fried with lemongrass must try and the best thing here with its clean and clear and crisp flavours,Positive
mrs-pho,very beautiful small restaurant with very friendly service and delicious soups try the fresh spring rolls yummi,Positive
mrs-pho,we were never satisfied with the pho we have had until we have tried mrs pho they are closer to what pho tastes like in the bay area and it is reasonably priced cheaper than most pho places in singapore give the salted lemon drink a try,Positive
mellben-seafood,the grab driver told us that this is a smart choice for chilli crab because it is less expensive but better taste locals eat here when it is chilli crab mission the walk in q was scarily long but we were able to order while in line the food came out and every single dish that we ordered was delicious,Positive
mellben-seafood,this place has a bit of a cult following so make sure you come early or call for reservations they do really good seafood and make a tasty chili salted egg or tanghoon crab the razor clams are good too the food is generally prepared singaporean chinese tze char style,Positive
mellben-seafood,a local joint for crab not your regular chilly crabs my coworker took me there and we had claypot crab which is bit soupy butter crab and cereal shrimp everything was great except the wait yes we waited for an hour in line and then hour for food we got there at   and left at  so be prepared to wait and food will be worth it,Positive
mellben-seafood,great seafood chili crab paper crab fish prawns they also serve meat vegetable and other dishes we a large group of more then  went all of us enjoyed the meal rank very high as a local chili crab and seafood place this is my rd visit,Positive
mellben-seafood,two things to order crab bee hoon soup in claypot butter crab ok maybe add fried buns mantou you can skip the rest you are only here for the crabs nothing but crabs the bad is the long wait averaging   hours though it seemed like the wait is more   mins now even at pm on a thursday night the line was still there it only disappeared at pm you are warned make reservations though they do not take it during the  days of chinese new year now why the crabs the crab bee hoon soup is just very tasty the taste is similar to the fish bee hoon soup but this is sweeter and tastier the butter crab is to die for the butter cream is so tasty and perfect to dip the mantou in we had  crabs for  persons and it was just nice,Positive
mellben-seafood,as everyone knows this is the best spot for crabs in singapore well this was the only spot i visited due to the amount of time i had here you can get crab cooked in different ways but the most popular is the chili crab and the fried mon taos seem to be popular and used to soak up the sauces and do not be like me trying to muscle through some of the crab pieces i ended up slicing my finger pretty bad ask for a cracker or something to get into it we ordered way too much food but my cousins wanted to try as much as we could since it was our last night the food was bomb but the price is super expensive i think the total came out to about  usd for the  of us we didnt make reservations but we only waited about  minutes for a table highly recommend you to try out if visiting singapore just make sure you dont eat and jet they have cameras and pictures of ppl who have done it before lmao,Positive
mellben-seafood,finally visited mellben after years of everyone telling me that we should go firstly make reservations if not you will wait for a long time even with reservations you have to wait secondly know that this place is pricy if you are having crabs be prepared to drop a good dime here estimate about  for a medium crab good for  or  i think we got the butter crab and crab bee hoon crab bee hoon is the classic dish here and everyone gets it it is very good add more soup and bee hoon it is worth it the butter crab is good too and has a more heavy flavor and is also very creamy both were delicious the crabs are fresh and the meat is plentiful and succulent after all you are paying good money for these crabs the other side orders are good too we got rojak chicken tofu with pork floss and mushrooms and salted egg pork ribs the salted egg pork ribs were not very meaty unfortunately come here for crabs the crabs are so good it would have been  stars if it were not so pricey were less touristy and had a better reservation queue system,Positive
mellben-seafood,i went there for dinner with my family i love their crab with the chilli sauce and claypot crab the bee hoon soup taste so good the place was quite hot because there is no air conditioner and u can get sweaty the cereal prawn is also good during the weekend or dinner time the queue can take up from  minutes to  hour conclusion recommended,Positive
mellben-seafood,i thought this was the perfect place to experience singaporean cuisine as a tourist it is further away from touristy areas tucked away in a residential neighborhood we got the chili crab and fried fish in a spicy sauce both at market price that day the crab was  and the fish was  it was well worth it everything was delicious my husband and i were both pleased and our bellies were full,Positive
mellben-seafood,this is one of the place you had to go when you are craving for crabs this is my nd visit here and i really love the way they cook the crabs here this outlet which i went is located at ang mo kio it is just located right below a hdb i went to this place on  separate occasion and it is always bustling with people there is a huge carpark located infront of the restaurant and fret not there is plenty of car lot but try to avoid popping by during dinner time as this is a residential area so car lot might be limited we order quite a number of dish that night and it was a treat by a friend therefore i cannot state the bill for the meal  signature crab beehoon soup  this is a must to try the broth make you go drooling and it is so flavourful as the beehoon and crab is cook together i always ask for extra portion of soup as it is really very good  salted egg yolk crab  anything cook with salted egg yolk is always so yummy the crab is coated with salted egg yolk and the flavour just blend in so well which keep your finger locking good butter crab  oh my the mantou really goes well with the butter sauce and the children keep dipping into the sauce with their mantou and crab i think this really tells you how good it is  cereal prawn  this is one of my all time favourite love the fragrant smell of the cereal and prawn they just simply blend in and the prawn is so crunchy if you ever pop by here pls order their signature crab beehoon soup trust me it is really very very good,Positive
mellben-seafood,we brought our overseas guests here on a rainy saturday evening have warned them about the snaky q as we did not make any reservations but it wasnt that bad actually perhaps because of the rain we were seated down after about  mins our food arrived  mins later we had the crab with bee hoon soup butter crab chilli crab with fried mantous dough for drinks we had the fresh coconut  each our guests love this place declare it as the most delicious crab they have ever eaten in sg in their  week trip here they have tried at least  different places for crabs the place is full of tourists locals price is stated clearly size of the crabs check out the wall of fame in the restaurant this place is not air conditioned  of us shared  small crabs,Positive
mellben-seafood,mellben is located under a hdb block in ang mo kio but because this restaurant been featured in some travel magazine this restaurant always pack with tourist so my suggestion will be make an effort to call and make a reservation  day before they are famous for their crab the most famous dish will be the crab beehoon rice noodles soup so you will see almost each table will have this dish the soup are very nice have a strong taste of crab freshness if you want more soup you may request for a bowl or two but they charge for each bowl or soup i also recommend that you try the butter and salted egg crab you might want to skip the chili crab personally i find it do not taste as good as lots of other restaurant in singapore the only problem i have with this restaurant is no aircon so get ready to sweat when enjoy those yummylious crab,Positive
mellben-seafood,not used to the reservation system here in singapore or maybe it is just this restaurant very confusing and disorganized apparently once you are here for your reserved seat while waiting in line outside you can and should start going thru the menus and begin ordering but keep in mind this the restaurant is open to the court yard the  star is for the crab dishes other dishes are nothing special the  style rib are not bad meat are tender falls off the bone services is  or less stars we found an old lady as our server she is nice but does not speak much english other that seems to speak better english is always in a rush,Negative
mellben-seafood,apparently this is where all the locals go great seafood it is not a fancy restaurant there is no ac but the food is delicious we had all things seafood cereal prawn kang kong two crabs one salted egg yum and the crab beehoon with the soup noodles get here early or expect a long queue everything is freshly cooked so it takes a little while as well for your food to be served,Positive
mellben-seafood,the crab bee hoon soup was pretty bomb wish they had cracked more of the crab shell for us though also cereal prawns are a must order black pepper crab was pretty large and legit no wait at all since we got there a few minutes after they opened at pm interesting that they have a policy that states meat is not guaranteed in the crab what so what am i paying   for then luckily we had meat in our crab price was not as bad as i was expecting only pp for a table of  and we were pretty stuffed,Negative
mellben-seafood,stars love this place about a  min walk from ang mo kio mrt but worth the trek officially my go to place when i have out of town visitors that need to try some chili crab the crabs are so meaty here and i learned to request for the male ones because the claws are bigger for those who think it is a hassle to eat crab and do not usually think it is worth the effort this place will change your mind i have also tried their famous crab bee hoon that comes in a claypot and actually like this better so if you have enough people try both flavors making reservations is also highly recommended,Positive
mellben-seafood,best crab bee hoon and butter crab in singapore having been away from singapore for long periods at a time this is one place i always crave for the crab bee hoon is super flavorful with the broth having a strong sweetness from the crab the butter crab is heavenly and always leaves me licking my fingers the wait here is very long even on rainy weekdays so definitely do come early the place is pretty hard to get to via mrt so you gotta drive or cab or bus here you still have to wait for about an hour for take out because they cook your order on the spot and it takes about an hour for the crab bee hoon to be ready trust me the wait is worth it,Positive
mellben-seafood,went here for dinner with my wife and long time friend we made a booking and confirmed it by phone when we arrived we had to order out in the street area we had a  month old with us but hey who cares the english is poor on everyone in fact they speak better english in mainland china the food was just ok for the price i expected a lot better razor clams were cold rice poorly cooked we spent around  best thing going for this place is the cheap beer,Positive
mellben-seafood,get ready to get your fingers dirty for some delicious seafood this is a great place but a bit out of the way from the mrt stations you would have to take the red north south line to ang mo kio and either have a long walk or hail a taxicab but the location is prime because of the large space be prepared to wait though there are usually long lines here and a group of  of us had to queue for about   minutes pick up a menu and prepare to order while waiting in line so the wait for your food will not take as long once you are seated we ordered  small chili crabs  small butter crabs  medium signature crab soup bee hoon noodle soup jia mantao fried buns which are great for dipping in the chili or butter sauce and stirred fried vegetables this was the perfect amount for  of us having tried a lot of seafood from all over the world from maine lobster to scandinavian salmon to hawker centres across singapore this has definitely been one of the freshest and most tasty seafood experiences i have had we ended up pay about  singaporean dollars per person which is not bad at all the wait is long but it is worth it,Positive
mellben-seafood,friends recommended this place they do not take reservations so the early arrival in evening could ease the pain of waiting in the long line we had salty egg crab and crab noodle soup the salty egg crab is deep fried and coated with salty egg sauce it is a genius combination if you love the nuance taste of salty egg crab noodle soup is amazingly delicious when drinking the soup it is like thousands of crabs dancing in the mouth although the crab is a little bit skinny not too much meat inside its flavor still captures my taste buds,Positive
mellben-seafood,amazing chili crab along with many servings of lightly fried man tou buns wow come here hungry b c this is one super filling meal destined to choke your arteries and douse any appetite the crab is sitting in this richly appointed sauce full of flavor and bits of crab you dip the deep fried mantou in the sauce and bask in all its glory while in the next move you are deftly picking delicate crab meat out of the hunking claw in front of you cave man foodie ness in all its glory,Positive
mellben-seafood,mellben mellben mellben how can anyone not like the seafood and their signature crab soup bee hoon the soup is just right in flavor and with the huge crab soaked in it it is truly heavenly of course other must try dishes include their deep fried prawns cooked with oatmeal chilli crab you can ask for less spicy for those who cant take the heat like me and fried dough fritters for a good seafood indulgence please make your way here do remember make reservation if you do not wanna wait too long in the queue oh oh something that i thought was hilarious yet cool if you head to the loo at the restaurant do not forget to check out the photos that they have put up of various people who tried their luck in getting a free meal all victims have their faces caught on tape and their pictures are plastered all over the sink area how shameful tsk tsk tsk,Negative
mellben-seafood,delicious creamy butter crabs it was worth the  hour wait with  drinks and  plates of fried mantou each plate had  mantous and a crab bee hoon it cost us  split by  people it was not too bad and we were bloated i could not eat anymore there was so much crab roe it was delicious but so high in cholesterol otherwise i would have eaten it all the butter crab sauce is perfect for dipping the mantou in i was tempted to ask if they just sell me the sauce would totally just eat the sauce with plain white rice the crab bee hoon though it was supposed to be bee hoon portions for  people  of us barely managed to finish it we were a party of  girls and  guy the soup is delicious although i could sense a great deal of msg in the soup but still worth the wait we came at pm and waited an hour for a table we came on a tuesday night,Positive
mellben-seafood,looooooooove the chilli and butter crab even the nai bai was good with garlic been here   times now i hardly try the other dishes other than the crab haha maybe the only reason to give this place a second thought is the high prices but i definitely would return again soon hahaoh do go early to queue no prior reservations are allowed and the queue can stretch pretty far,Negative
mellben-seafood,mellben used to be one of my favourite crab places i still like it although the prices have gone up substantially as they got more famous where they used to be one stall in a kopitiam they are now the entire kopitiam which got revamped to look more restaurant like adorned with decorated crab shells on the walls quite cute the prices are significantly more expensive now the crab bee hoon soup is still excellent rich and delicious as always the creamy butter crab still has the tasty sauce that few other stalls can replicate i also like the playboy chicken feng liu ji which is what people here would usually call thai style lemon chicken except it is better and comes with a beautiful sauce i still like it but it is become harder to justify coming back here as often as i used to just because of how expensive it has become,Positive
mellben-seafood,crab crab crab i love crab that is why i love melben it soothes the inner crab cravings crab bee hoon butter crab chili crab its all good this is the place to go if you have some way of transporting yourself out into the heartland,Positive
mellben-seafood,i love the food here this is where you can get one of the best seafood in the heartlands at heartland prices or close chilli crab pepper crab etc but the most amazing dish that i like is the cream crab of course their signature crab bee hoon is fantastic here too the only drawback is the wait times you have to wait around   hours depending on which date and time you go we went during dinner on a saturday and my poor friend had to stand in a long snaking line for almost  hours will i return yes,Positive
mellben-seafood,just based on the butter crab dish itself i would come back countless times the other dish that i would order is crab bathed in creamy less buttery soup with some udon like noodles the only two things i do not like is that one rude person who took my order and sounded like i owed him a great amount of money and the waiting time but who am i kidding here everywhere with good food needs to wait so the next time i go i hope that that guy wo not be there to take my order current medium which is the large crab over at mellbenn is about  per crab tell me where else would have tasty butter crab and i will hunt it down,Negative
mellben-seafood,i have been to this restaurant before and the food is good however this review is about the service i called ahead of time because i know how busy they can get and was told there was no need to reserve when we tarrived it turns out they have a problem with the kitchen and the wait was going to be  hours this was very disappointing especially since i had called ahead of time to find out the situation and meant we were out of pocket by s  because of the taxi fare to get to the restaurant,Negative
mellben-seafood,crab beehoon butter crab and a bunch of mantous are all you need for an evening of delicious indulgence the food is as legendary as the long wait times for a table if you come later than pm there was a time when they allowed you to call for a take away order which lets you skip those ridiculous hour long waits not sure if they allow that anymore,Positive
mellben-seafood,utterly absolutely amazing i am hard pressed to think of a better place to get a crab fix this place was so highly adorned by my fellow crab worshipping friends yet i was an unbeliever for the longest time for this i repent we shared a huge butter crab chilli crab and a bowl of crab bee hoon with a whole crab in it of course everything was absolutely stunning the least overwhelming one was probably the chilli crab mostly because this is a taste you could get from your jumbos and long beaches and the chilli sauce is not particularly special the butter crab on the other hand was soooo to die for it was tastefully sweet and perfectly buttery think about the best butter prawns you have had in your life and think of that taste in a bottle now open that bottle and pour that insane goodness all over this beautifully fat steamed crab throw on some curry leaves and you have got a plate of perfection before you i confess to underestimating the power of the crab bee hoon when my friends proposed to order that i was going all huh noodles at a crab place really but how incredibly wrong i was the broth was sooo sedap and rich with the fragrance of the crab cooked in it it is also very milky and makes a perfect accompaniment to the noodles or just as a soup on its own it is so good that it makes the crab in it a little underwhelming it was ultimately still really good steamed crab but i spent most of my time slurping the soup with noodles and digging into the butter crab instead one warning though be ready to queue for so so long bring a stool bring a fan bring a book bring a friend we went really early at pm and were fortunate to only have to wait in line for about  minutes but a friend of mine once spent  hours in line on a weekday night so brace yourself,Positive
mellben-seafood,ok as most things go they used to be better now they have done some renovation and looks like a real restaurant rather than a tze char restaurant on a hdb void deck good or bad it depends on your preference i only come for the crab beehoon soup and it is still the best around it is like the best sliced fish beehoon that you have tried only that it is made with crab so it is sweeter and thicker yums we typically cleaned the entire claypot have not tried any other crab dishes here not sure if it is that common or only common here but they post photos of customers who leave without paying i guess as a form of public shaming weird kind of,Positive
mellben-seafood,got there at pm and first dish arrived at pm great food nonetheless the crab pot with rice noodle was just brilliant less heavy compare to the pepper crab or curry crab butter shrimp was delicious as well and the lime juice helped to cool down in the heat the let down was the long queue and long wait even after getting the table,Positive
mellben-seafood,the best buttered and pepper crab i have tasted in singapore bit pricey but all worth it,Positive
mellben-seafood,my family comes here often for chili crab and black pepper crab i was impressed by how clean the crabs were and how great they tasted i am adverse to briny flavors and cannot stand crab and lobster normally but this place does crab right i have not been able to find a restaurant anywhere in the us that emulates this restaurant my only gripe with this place is the customer service it is not the best and that really is not acceptable our chrysanthemum tea had dead flies in it it was like the box was infested with dead fruit flies and they just brewed the tea anyhow my cousin and my aunties raised hell and it was quite possibly the funniest moment i have ever seen this being said they first tried to deny it and then they brought us fresh tea regardless of this they did not do anything else to make up for their folly no discount no service of extra food not even a genuine and heartfelt apology the food is fantastic but is it really worth putting up with lackluster customer service you will have to decide,Negative
mellben-seafood,one of my favorite places for crabs their food is always so good whenever i go and it is amazing how long the queue is the downside is they do not take reservation but luckily the queue moves quite fast i just hope they are not going to get more expensive than they already are,Positive
mellben-seafood,terrible awful service very rude staff the food used to be nicer but standards have dropped over the last  years the service standards have dropped to an all time low,Negative
mellben-seafood,after being on my list of places to check out for ages a few of us went down to mellben amk to try their famous crab bee hoon on mothers day  firstly the queue is always large others here seem to think you can get through quickly at certain hours but not anywhere near dinner we arrived at  pm were seated at  pm and the food arrived after pm but when it does arrive it is well worth the wait the menu does not have prices listed which is terrible so prices may be slightly off the first to arrive was the tofu combination   which was a dozen or so fried tofu squares some broccoli two shelled prawns and two scallops quite average next up was the famous fried crab bee hoon  we were lucky to get a female crab with lots of roe and the whole dish is out of this world awesome not an incredibly secret list of ingredients it should be easy to replicate this at home finally the last dish was butter crab  which i would never have ordered normally except i read the comments on hgw and honestly believe in the wisdom of crowds very awesome dish the sauce was thick buttery had a hint of chili and went perfect with the crab so the positives were to be expected the crabs are fantastic and well worth the trek to amk their are a few suggestions i have put prices on the menus yes i know seafood is at market price but even the veges on the menu are not priced it is great that service charge gst are included but everyone should do this the tofu combination is below par take credit cards and lose the whole no  guarantee crap no one advertises their terrible customer service,Negative
mellben-seafood,when my colleagues discovered that i am a crab lover they whisked me away to mellben over the weekend it was at a kopitiam in one of the hdb estates in ang mo kio the environment was bustling and filled with hungry customers the mellben signboard hung high and proud on top of the shop there was no price list for us to reference it was just talking to the person who took orders and praying it all wo not be too wallet busting the range for crabs is generally   depending on market price we had the chili crab with the fried buns for dips the gravy was sweet with generous pools of eggs the claws were full of juicy crab meat but other than that it was not very memorable especially for the money that was spent crabs are already good to begin with and i have tasted better ones elsewhere be prepared for long queues during peak periods,Negative
mellben-seafood,my mouth still waters thinking about this chili crab temple had  types including bee hoon which had an amazing milky broth black pepper and butter shared among four the mantou are perfect for soaking up the chili crab sauce finger licking good should be applied here and bring some extra packs of napkins back again for more crab choose large for the chili crab medium bee hoon for  also had the shrimp in curry sauce lemongrass very nice add some veggies,Positive
mellben-seafood,chili crab was big and good i preferred the crab in the light soup that this place specialized in the chili stuff overpowers the natural flavors of the crab the crabs are huge from sri lanka expect to wait to be seated,Negative
mellben-seafood,this is my favorite haunt for crabs simply because they have the best crabs in town unfortunately the rest of the food items are just a okay so i usually only eat crabs when i am here one of those places that again has long lines does not matter if you would made a reservations you still have to queue up to some extent the good thing is that it is worth the wait my absolute favorite is the butter crab the sauce is sweet savory and a little spicy all at the same time and the crabs are so sweet and meaty i have never tried the salted egg yolk flavor but it looks good as well the chili crab is pretty good and the crab vermicelli soup is very good as well,Positive
mellben-seafood,far from everything if you go there for chilli crabs that is all you are going to do there it is walking distance from nowhere and quite a cab ride from the orchard st area employees barely speak english for those out of towners make sure you plan your ride back and forth from the restaurant because it is not exactly in a populated area where there is tons of active cab activity although it is right off of a bus station however if you are visiting the area for the first time and you are unfamiliar with the public transportation system this may not be the best place to go for a first dinner the yelp listing said it closed at  when i went on    but they really close at pm so i did not actually get a chance to try their food but be warned this place is as casual as it gets all seating is covered outdoor do not expect an ounce of elegance would not go for a date but for an authentic experience it may be worth it,Negative
mellben-seafood,this place has to be one of the hidden secrets of singapore it is tucked inside an hdb housing estate even some of my singaporean friends who live in the area did not know about it until i told them the crab bee hoon was simply fantastic the crab was extremely fresh and meaty and the soup very very savory in addition to the crab bee hoon the stirfry dishes are really good too with crispy vegetables and tender meats just like how they are supposed to be the one hour wait was well worth it the price was reasonable for the quality and quantity of the food definitely better in every way compared with the boat quay tourist traps this is a place for people who truly know how to appreciate good food and experience life in another culture it is not for those who look for hard rock cafes everywhere they go if you are going there from the cbd try taking the  bus it is not as speedy as the mrt but you will get to see a lot more life is about experiencing different cultures the food the people and the daily lives give this place a try and skip the chains,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this restaurant was pretty good while on vacation in singapore stumbled across this restaurant looking for seafood cuisine i was a little nervous about the look of the restaurant and the fish crab lobster etc that were in the tanks however the food did not disappoint had the spicy crab dish and it was delicious also tried the jellyfish dish which was interesting haha the atmosphere of the restaurant was nice my dinner party sat outside and it was the perfect temperature lots of tables and people sitting outside you also have a nice view of the lagoon lake also it was situated in a place that had a boardwalk feel with tons of restaurants bars nightlife etc so it was very convenient took a taxi to the restaurant so not sure about parking,Positive
jumbo-seafood,if you visit singapore you need to go try this restaurant this place is delicious the restaurant is located by the river in clarke quay good location with a beautiful view there are tables inside the restaurant and outdoor seating as well tip i would suggest making online reservations ahead of time because this place is always busy and the wait time is insane jumbo is well known for their award winning chili crab which is amazing however i think their salted egg dishes were much tastier specially the stir fried with golden salted egg crab and the de shelled prawns fried with golden salted egg salted egg is not popular here in the u s so getting to try this in singapore was a yummy experience since there is sauce all over the crabs be prepared to get your hands messy the prices for their seafood is a bit expensive but the food is worth it i will be back here again the next time i visit singapore,Positive
jumbo-seafood,when i travel to a new country i make it a point to try the local dish when i found out that the specialty dish was chill crab i was ecstatic i love seafood and i especially love crab i researched best places to eat chill crab in singapore and this restaurant popped up among two others my coworker and i chose this one because it had riverside seating when i read reviews a lot of people mentioned that it was pricey i wish i would have researched that part a bit more cause i definitely got some sticker shock  per crab they are huge but it is still a lot of money was it worth it honestly yes i actually went to go eat one more before i left singapore i got the chili crab cause i like to try the typical traditional dish first the sauce was a tiny bit sweet which i was not crazy about at first but as i started to eat i loved it more my coworker order the pepper crab it was soooo much pepper they do not take cheap out on the black pepper my friend was suffering after awhile cause it was a bit too spicy for her these crabs do not come with any sides so i had to order a fried rice on the side overall i think we spent  on lunch crazy i know but hey how often do you get to eat chili crab in singapore the offered other seafood dishes as well if i could have afforded it i would have ordered more,Positive
jumbo-seafood,was referred to this place by a local for a hot spot for tourists and locals alike at first glance it looks poppin they have an automated electronic queue system to handle the big lines at their doors i was hopeful howeveri have had chili crab before by the bay and others and this was extremely disappointing presentation was good the meal altogether was mediocre at best you have to order the rice and fried buns traditional sides chili crab comes with a la carte to me it did not taste fresh the fried shrimp was oddly a little soggy and the crab was practically glued to the shell something i have never experienced before the taste was good but you are definitely better off getting crab by the bay better pricing for way better food it was very clear that they were understaffed as the service was terrible none of the food came out at the same time the waiter kept forgetting what we asked for and they do not have napkins it took nearly  minutes after we ate for someone to come and clear the check the interior was a mess on the surface level it looks clean and nice however the front desk was loaded w a hodgepodge full of random stuff trash was overflowing inside the storage for the restaurant was clearly visible the bathroom was atrocious and the only was to get though to it was through a hall behind the kitchen a cook and i almost ran into each other on the way out from the bathroom gross jumbo is definitely a bit of a tourist trap and if you are in the mood for chili crab and cannot go for i guess it would suffice but personally i do not think it represents the dish to its full potential,Negative
jumbo-seafood,we wanted to try chili crab and we heard that this place was a great place to try it at plus it was right on the water in clarke quay we showed up without reservations around pm and there was no wait for us we asked to be seated by the water and the host said ok no problem as we walked to the table the hostess informed us that we would need to be finished by  pm the place was packed and we were seated next to the walk way and the garbage dirty dish area we asked again and were pretty much ignored as the wait staff yelled at one another over us the service itself is not that great so remember to focus why you are there in the first place to try the chili crab we ordered kg of mud crab to be cooked in the chilli style they have other ways to prepare it but we stuck with what singapore is famous for singaporeans also consider this to be one of their national dishes we also ordered the salted egg prawns our order came out pretty quickly it was a nicely presented mud crab in a dish of chilli type sauce the great news is that most of the crab is already pre cracked and broken apart making this much easier and quicker to eat the flavor did not disappoint it was a nice red sauce that had a slight heat mixed in with the sweet if i had known better i would have ordered some bread to soak up the sauce but we were so full we did not need it the salted egg prawn was delicious it is basically a tempura shrimp dusted in some sort of sweet salt it was delicious overall we spent about usd and had good food with a terrible spot in the restaurant and pretty poor service,Positive
jumbo-seafood,super expensive right across clarke quay with a great view of the river definitely a tourist spot but the food is really good thier signature was the chili crab and when you order it you will know why almost licked that plate clean everything else was delicious too so i dont think you can go wrong with picking anything here you eat the chilicrab with your hands and they provide bibs like the crab shrimp spot boiling crab as well as food grade gloves upon request this place does fall into some tourist traps though they come by to leave peanuts but do not tell you that they will charge it on your bill you only have a limited time before you are ushered out to seat more guests and the water is charged as well though to be fair it is bottle water flagging down a waiter to get anything was incredibly difficult where at one point two tables next to us were waiting to get thier bill trying to flag someone down as well overall a pretty nice spot to impress tourists pricey but next to the lively night scene of clarke quay had chili crab for the first time here and it was finger licking good,Positive
jumbo-seafood,make a reservation if you can it gets pretty busy we had to wait around  mins to be seated for  people on a monday night at  pm and when we were finally called and seated we were told we had to vacate our table by  pm having said that they did not force us off the table when  pm came round there were other tables becoming available and figured they did not need ours in too mush of a rush the service itself is not that great so remember to focus why you are there in the first place for the chili crab we ordered kg of crab to be cooked in the chilli style they offer other cooking style but we stuck with what singapore is famous for and ordered a few of the fried dough bun great for dipping in the chilli sauce or you can order rice which i saw on other tables and the dish did not disappoint it was not spicy at all and i do not do spicy it had a slight heat mixed in with the sweet the crab was very meaty and made it easy to enjoy the dish as a whole also ordered the lobster g glass noodle in clay pot this dish i could have done without the lobster was over done and the flavour was lacking when ate alongside the chili crab i found myself dipping the lobster meat into the chilli sauce the cost of the chilli crab was reasonable at s  for the kg crab we had but the s  g lobster was disappointing i would wished i ordered the prawn dishes instead,Negative
jumbo-seafood,if you come to singapore you have to try some good seafood teochew and hokkien cooking really knows how to take seafood to the next level that you wo not find anywhere else in the world behold the famous singaporean chili black pepper crab we ordered also the baby squid taro scallop salted egg shrimp and pork alongside a feast for a king for sure worth the money if you love high end bougie hearty stuff this is located right by the quay so you get lovely scenery and the bar scene is super nice at night after you are done great pics of the skyline of singapore from here as well pork goodness ribs done to the next level savory sweet and covered with the satisfying almond crunch on top great way to kick off our meal baby squid taste of sweet sesame over crunchy but still slightly chewy squid baby squid is tender and having each individual squid per bite is so different from rings or calamari in my opinion the texture and taste is sweet and naturally tender taro scallop if you love taro then you gotta try teochew or singaporean version of taro it is usually fried until aromatic paired with some coconut milk and gingko nuts at the end of a high end meal this is to the next level they deep fried it with these large succulent scallops in the middle holy cow if this is not some delicious rich stuff then idk what else is salted egg shrimp does this meal get better or what salted egg is such a unique thing to singapore they even started a salted egg crusted fish skin as local potato chips which are also deliciously sinful forget about popcorn shrimp you use egg yolks as the crust holy cow my arteries are crying but in joy would do it again salty rich and not super crunchy and overly salty like a potato chip this is a worth it dish to get and now the chili crab bro prepare to get your hands dirty b c the point of this dish is to finish that sauce that the crab has taken time to brew and stew in the crab is delicious but that chili paste that this thing has been cooking in is a complexly layered seafood chili thing that you must dip the sweet bun into better not leave any sauce left b c it is worth like  a bite on this dish and the sauce is excellent worth getting this take a stroll down clarke is quay afterwards for a neon lights reflecting on the water chill bars and the singapore marina sands hotel reflecting across the waterways,Positive
jumbo-seafood,skip it although the location is nice service was poor and the food just ok when we were seated we were given  minutes before we had to vacate our table we ordered an appetizer noodle dish and a steamed fish the fish were priced by the g our waiter was quite reluctant to inform us about anything other than the larger portions available the noodles came in about  minutes but the appetizer was no where in sight another  minutes later we cancelled it  minutes into our wait the noodles were cold by now we asked about our fish and asked again about  minutes later finally got it in another  the sauce it was cooked in was nice but the fish was dry and lacked much flavor it was just ok given the poor service long wait times and high prices they also tack on additional charges to the menu prices on your bill maybe that was disclosed on the menu but i did not see it it was a lot of money for a disappointing experience there is so much great food in singapore unfortunately we did not find any here we did a lot better overall at hawker stalls,Negative
jumbo-seafood,it started out good service was attentive but after first course it was crickets had to flag down several staff to get more hot water for tea finally got all the food delivered kind of strange and disappointed with lamb they were plated individually and had a brown sauce on it food was only okay had better not really worth the  especially when in the end i had diarrhea,Negative
jumbo-seafood,what a lovely place to eat crab the three nights we stayed in singapore we had dinner here two nights both times we ordered the chili crab the staff was very helpful recommending the size of crab because the price is not cheap one crab for two people can easily cost you close to a hundred bucks highly recommend if you like crabs,Negative
jumbo-seafood,a very busy place lucky we made a reservation and selected to eat in air conditioning comfort we loved the chilli crab with the fried and steam buns to soak up the yummy sauce the cereal prawns were crispy and sweet lots of leftover crumbs to enjoy an expensive meal compared to other restaurants serving similar food service was average so do not forget to take your own tissues they only provide the wet wipes enjoy the yummy crab,Positive
jumbo-seafood,must order  chilli crab salted egg crab if you cannot take spicy chilli  salted egg fish skin salted egg prawns spinach with century egg salted eggbefore ordering any crab double check with the staff what is the pricing for the crabs on nd jan  the pricing was  per kg i ordered a salted egg crab and asked for the smallest size the staff told me it was g and i agreed but when the bill came they charged us  and i queried the staff and the staff said the crab that was sent to my table was indeed g then i asked why was i charged  he apologised and reprinted the bill with a   discount so beware when you get the bill that the pricing of the crab reflects the weight of the crab that you ordered the salted egg fish skin is freshly fried upon order and hence it is way better than any of the pre packaged junk food that you get at convenience stores or supermarkets always make a reservation i called up and they told me that they were fully booked and that i had to walk in i did not give up and found jumbo listed on chope a reservation website and managed to make a pm booking on chope i witnessed a caucasian couple walk in and they were told it was a  hour waiting time on a wednesday night,Negative
jumbo-seafood,the chili crab was one of the must try food if singapore it was creamy and just the right amount of spice the crab was cooked well and the atmosphere by the water was great the crab was prepared well and made easy to eat because the crab shell was already cracked the salted shrimp was by far salty yet very tasty and i finished the entire bowl of shrimp i recommend making a reservation since the restaurant can be very busy and the wait time for walk in may seem too long,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the place is an awesome seafood place this place is not for the faint hearted because the prices here is probably one of the most expensive seafood place in singapore but let me tell you it is worth every penny the food talks for itself,Positive
jumbo-seafood,not cheap but this is my go to place for chilli crab in the city if you are visiting singapore everyone will tell you that you have to try chili crab before you leave their other seafood dishes are tasty as well last time i was here i came in a large group and dinner came out to be about  sgd pp including beers they get busy so come early or call ahead to make a reservation,Positive
jumbo-seafood,you know you have had a good dinner date when you had to call your girlfriend and tell her how good it was me girl i think i had the best dinner date that i had in awhile i had a date with cc and damn was he good girlfriend girl really i wanna hear all about it tell me me girl he was a little small you know what they say about those little ones right but he was packing and all the right places honey and he was hard as a shell but i sure did not mind cracking him open now let is not forget about the good old taste my friend did cece taste good me girl did he he was so flavorful and delicious i know people were staring at me sucking all over him but i just could not help myself especially when it was time to get to that good ol meat oh lord that was the best part all i had to do was use my hands let is just say i left very pleased and satisfied jumbo seafood has the best chilli crab cc i ever ate in my life i have been hearing so much about jumbo that i just had to try it for myself as i was in town and i am happy i did i arrived on my last day of singapore at around  p m an hour before they close staff welcomed me with open arms and set me outside i ordered the chilli crab signature crab dish and fried rice with eggs also do not forget to get there mini buns so you can suck up all the juice from the crab beware they will place nuts on your table that are not complimentary you actually pay for those if u do not want it send it back once i noticed i was paying for them i kindly asked them to remove the nuts off the table and off my bill yeah i know many people talk about how expensive this place is but honestly it is all worth it fortunately i was able to get a  discount as they were offering that to any citibank participants if you have citibank make sure you bring your card beat the crowds and come at night especially to enjoy the lovely view of clarke quay this is a must when visiting singapore until next time cc emoji happy face,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i have watched so many tv shows introducing this restaurant when they travel to singapore since chili crab is one of the must eat foods in singapore so i had to try to save time be sure to make reservation on line or expect long wait chili crab s price is market price and normally around   dollars for  kg in additional to chili crab i ordered prawn with cereal fried baby squid mini bun steam rice and tiger beer baby squid is perfect side dish to eat with beer prawn with cereal does not seem like it goes well but it does and delicious you can eat it as is or peel of the prawn shells and eat with cereal be sure to finish them first when hot it does not taste good when cold my main dish chili crab can be messy since you have to break the shells using your hands taste is not good as i expected so many people praise this food and i really had huge expectations about this food it was delicious but not as good to praise it i would not eat again since value of this dish is too high compare to taste one time to try it out is enough for me as a tip best way to eat chili crab is dip the mini bun and eat or mix it with steam rice and eat be careful with the things they offer since it is not free when you are seated they will come with tea and peanut as they give to you as free of charge if you accept them you will be charged also you will see small orange wet towel packet once you use it it will be charged,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i rarely use the term must try but when in singapore there are indeed two local specialties that every visitor should try the first one is the world famous singapore chili crab a whole large crab already cut into pieces and with the shells cracked open was served in a wok shaped dish filled with the world is yummiest chili sauce the heat of the chili was moderate which i think was enough to give the dish a good kick without being overwhelming it was more of a sweet chili sauce that had a tasty and soothing sweetness that was perfect for my palate using the red hot chili pepper scale that many restaurants use i would say it was probably   chili peppers the sauce was very rich in the natural flavor of the crab meat and it is a perfect companion of the fried rice that we ordered i could eat that fried rice with the chili sauce all day every day the crab itself was meaty juicy and packed with natural yumminess of the sea wear a bib get your hands messy and dirty and savor every bite of the meat that you manage to extract out of the shells besides the chili crab we also ordered a mango and roast duck appetizer the app was a cold salad made with hand pulled or shredded roast duck meat slices of fresh mango and baby cucumbers it was tossed in a sweet and slightly tangy asian vinaigrette that was close to heavenly there are plenty of places in singapore where you can find the famous chili crab but if you are in the gorgeous vibrant and somewhat romantic clarke quay area jumbo is the place to go,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the chili crab is legendary here and the view over the canal to clarke quay is beautiful thumbs up,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i did not order anything we were with family friends who are locals and they ordered all the food and when i say all i am pretty sure they ordered the whole menu we had the chili crab lamb black pepper crab mee go reng steamed fish seafood fried rice cereal shrimp and kang kong it must be a singapore thing but all they had on the tables were lemon water and a wet napkin no regular napkins the cereal shrimp was ok the chili crab was great until i got to the claw and it tasted like ammonia the fried rice and mee go reng were by far my favorite well i did it i did the touristy thing and tried the chili crab the sauce was really good just wish the claw did not taste like ammonia,Negative
jumbo-seafood,ok you need to do this if you visit singapore seriously they are a staple in the country and have an amazing experience for most we had a large party of folks this is the achilles heel of this joint they squeeze an insane number of people in here and do not really care about how comfortable you are there is my negative for the review that is it the food is amazing we had the chilli crab the black pepper crab spicy seafood noodles and lots of snacks please trust me they k ow what they are doing these guys make amazing dishes and are widely known for them go pig out and do not complain about the bill,Positive
jumbo-seafood,over hyped really pricey soso food and soso service knowing full well that most of the negative reviews on ta and yelp were due to people not making reservations ahead of time we made reservations a month and half ahead of time we came to this particular jumbo seafood since it was closest to our hotel based on recommendations from other fellow travelers we came here specifically for the chilli crab when we arrived we were seated right away and during the chaos of being seated while they were getting the table ready they offered tea along with peanuts we later found out tea was  sgd per person and peanuts were also sgd and was never communicated to us they were for a charge while we were there service was soso tea was rarely refilled and we had to flag down our waiter to place our order we also had to flag down our server for the bill and it took about min for our credit card to be returned to us i understand it is an extremely busy restaurant but for what they charge i would expect more attentiveness in terms of service in terms of food our chilli crab was roughly  kg it was lukewarm tasted like mildly spicy tomato eggs and we were not at all impressed award winning my butt who is handing out these awards the crab itself cost about sgdto sum in all up no i would not recommend this place to anyone not at this price tag,Negative
jumbo-seafood,this review is based on the two main dishes this is all i eat here and will ever eat here because i cannot get anything anywhere else that tastes as good as these dishes do here if like me your companion does not eat seafood and is allergic to shellfish there are limited options that being said i always get the black pepper crab and i eat the whole thing sometimes i have had two but they were pressed for the table so one had to do this time this is by far the best black pepper crab you can get in singapore i have had black pepper crab in other restaurants non jumbo i have tried white pepper crab and nothing comes even close to the heavenly yummy deliciousness that is black pepper crab from jumbo i tried the chili crab but for me the the chili hides the taste of the crab whereas the black pepper enhances it in addition the chili crab is slightly sweet which i do not like baby kailan in garlic sauce omg so good cooked to the perfect tenderness and crunchiness not overly garlicky in case you are concerned about that my boyfriend had the rib eye with black pepper sauce and he thought that while it was not your traditional au poivre sauce it was good especially considering the options their house red wine is also pretty good do not hesitate that is all folks honestly this is a must if you visit singapore they have several other locations in case riverside point is booked if you go book and book early to ensure your seat,Positive
jumbo-seafood,when visiting singapore one must try the chili crab heard about this popular place from a few local friends and decided to check it out if you are planning to eat here i highly recommend putting in reservations way beforehand once you get your rsvp secured do make sure to show up on time or else you will lose your spot to the other hungry individuals who are waiting around and trying to get in without needing a rsvp once seated it is time to put on some bibs and feast highly recommend ordering chili crab for a party of   one chili crab is enough to feed everyone with the abundance of chili i suggest getting a couple of side dishes since eating the crab itself is not too filling if you are hungry for the side dishes i recommend getting the scallop appetizers plus rice or noodles the scallop appetizers itself was a very unique dish crispy with taro on the outside and hot and soft on the inside this is definitely yummy and different as for the fried rice we got it was not anything too stellar but it went well with the leftover chili once the crab meat was gone we also ordered the recommended fried mini buns but found it to be quite underwhelming in comparison to most of the food that was ordered nothing is free so do keep in mind that if you drink the tea on the table or touch those small plates of peanuts you will have to pay for it tricky tricky i know even asking for water will equal to you paying for it service overall was quick and efficient every table has a time limit so do observe the time also this place does take credit card and can split bills which is a nice plus,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i knew that during my first visit to singapore that chili crab would be a must try so while exploring the clarke quay area me and justin b stopped at jumbo seafood for dinner we arrived around  ish which i consider late for dinner haha and the place was still crowded they have their waiting list system down to a science use the ipad set up front put your telephone in receive a text or just take a seat in the waiting area and watch for your name to show up on the screen genius that they separate your wait times based on party size too since we were a small party we were seated after about a   minute wait so it wasnt bad at all lots more outdoor seating than indoors but its nice to sit outside along the water and people watch service was nothing to write home about but that was expected and we declined the tea and peanuts to avoid charges haha obviously we were there for the chili crab so thats what we ordered haha the crab for the  of us was i think ish usd and we paired it with an order of seafood fried rice which was more than enough food for us we were provided with bibs which were definitely needed haha but wow the chili crab was good the sauce was a bit sweet and not too spicy and paired with the rice nicely the meal is quite messy and it could get troublesome to crack the crab with slippery hands haha but they do give you a wet nap at the end to clean up a bit haha definitely a must try while in singapore,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i had heard all about the famous singapore chili crab after reading that jumbo seafood was the place to try it i had to check it out i wanted to go to clarke quay anyway and am glad i made the choice they were lines of people waiting to be seated but the system was very organized and the wait was less than five minutes i snagged a seat outside with views of the water service was excellent the table was preset with peanuts they charge you extra for this but do not tell you beforehand jasmine tea and anything you could need for eating seafood i perused the menu but ultimately succumbed to the classic chili crab first i started off with a glass of tiger beer this was refreshing and a good way to cool off from the humidity outside i had my seafood eating bib utensils and disposable gloves i had seen other diners using this and i am so glad that i requested them my chili crab was brought out very shortly it was everything it is been cracked up to be the sauce was heavenly the crab was super fresh i ordered some steamed buns to soak up the fantastic sauce word of advice this dish is very messy regardless of how well you prepare even the gloves and bib wo not keep you from making a mess so make sure there are no cameras around lolservice was excellent while somewhat pricey this was the best meal i had in singapore,Positive
jumbo-seafood,great foods horrible price cheap on cleaning supplies like napkin i had to use table cloths to clean my hands i did not have enough room on the small plate that they set out i had to leave the shells on the table clothes adorable the price i am paying why are they so cheap on the amenities we still have   hour left yet they start to clean the table i am not coming back,Negative
jumbo-seafood,so i was told chili crabs is a must eat while you are in singapore so my friend took me to jumbo seafood clarke quay location to get my chili crab fix reservation is recommended this place is packed but we put our name into the walk up que and the wait was not too bad they call you so we went down the road a little and got a drink while we waited clarke quay is a popular waterfront restaurant section in singapore and i was told that you are paying for the ambiance food would be slightly pricier than other location the location was beautiful we got a seat outside right on the water it was great spot and i see why there might be a slight up charge the service was very good so i did not mind the slight up charge for the location as for the chili crab i thought it was good but the black pepper crab was phenomenal we also got mee goreng this delicious noddle dish i could not stop eating after i ran out of crab and kangkong with sambal which was so tasty i took the extra home and ate for breakfast the next day honest other than the chili crab being ok the food was excellent i highly recommend the black pepper crab you wo not be disappointed,Positive
jumbo-seafood,says open till pm turns out last order is  i arrived at  no seating no good rating so totally bummed was my only chance to get crabs this trip popular tourist stop looked at prices seems expensive,Positive
jumbo-seafood,yum yum yum if you are in singapore for the first time second time maybe third basically if you are in singapore you should go here chili crab is different from any other crab you are going to have i grew up in maryland we eat crab we cover it it old bay we wear bibs and use full rolls of paper towels but this is different it comes in skillets it is spicier it comes with sides and chili crab sauce you still use a full roll of paper towels but it is a fancier singaporean experience that should not be missed besides the experience the crab itself is delicious succulent and tender do not over eat let the chili crab be the star sit outside grab a tiger beer do not forget to make a reservation and enjoy,Positive
jumbo-seafood,come here for the chilli crab and fried mantou buns since we did not make a reservation we came right when they opened and waited for about  minutes my bf and i shared a table with a sweet couple from thailand and another gentleman we sat outside under the cover of the canopy so it was nice to see the water and lights around us as we ate i would recommend refusing the tea and peanuts at the beginning of the meal if you do not want to pay for them skip all the extras like the seafood fried rice overrated and overpriced and get yourself a chili crab a few fried mantous per person and garlic baby bok choy pray that your food comes all at once and you are not devouring the veggies while waiting for your crab and then waiting for the plain white rice when you are already   done with your crab as for the chili crab the sauce is just amazing we paid about  sgd for a   kg crab it can get messy so just release your inhibitions put on your bib and dig in the rice and fried buns are just vehicles to eat as much of the delicious sauce as possible if i had no shame i would have taken the leftover sauce home with us the crab was big enough to feed the two of us and then some,Positive
jumbo-seafood,when in singapore you try the chili crabs we decided to throw in the black pepper crab too we said not too spicy but it still burned our palates the black pepper crab was not as spicy i would have to describe the black pepper crab as a dark peppery flavor not as appealing as the chili crab the chili crab was full of flavor with a mix of spicy and sweet it was a bit spicy for my liking to enjoy it fully the price for two crabs and a can of soda came out to about  us dollars yes pricey for my standards but again you come to say you have eaten the chili crab at jumbo seafood after all we figured this may be our only time in singapore live it up,Positive
jumbo-seafood,we were here for a work dinner which went very well the restaurant accommodated us in a private room which made our meal feel special we ordered several dishes to share family style and my favorite was the king crab definitely a must try the coconut shrimp is also another great option,Positive
jumbo-seafood,love the chili crab with little buns for sopping up the sauce order extra buns wanted to lick the skillet if it was socially acceptable one of my favorite meals of all time will miss having this when back in california,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this place is definitely way way way over hyped if you are reading this save yourself money and time first time having chilli crab and expected it to be beyond amazing the crab came out cold and the chilli sauce tasted almost like candy because it was beyond sweet the small sized crab costed  ordered fried rice cereal prawns not recommended also very sweet and small sized prawns veggie dish and noodles all costed close to  food was not tasty then there is the service which did not make up for the horrible food the bus boys were super friendly however the gentlemen who took our order and collected our receipt was beyond rude who ever was working the outside patio on    at the riverside location he impatiently stood by the table waiting for me to sign the check while looking over the receipt he sticks out his hand in front of my face indicating i was taking too long to sign he then proceeds to grab the check and walk away i have never received such service like that i will not be recommending jumbo to any of my family and friends if you are reading this save yourself money it is not worth the hype,Negative
jumbo-seafood,the infamous singapore chili crab is what drew me to this establishment this location is located in the clarke quay area and is a beautiful spot if you are wanting to eat here during normal dining hours after   pm i would recommend making a reservation to make sure you get a table the service is fantastic and the food was delicious make sure to order the chili crab and an extra order of the bread overall this was a great dining experience that complimented by singapore visit,Positive
jumbo-seafood,it was a good experience to eat my first chili crab here two of us ended up with  bill they got some award for this chili crab so we only ordered a chili crab garlic broccoli and a dozen of the fried manto crab i feel it was not too special salty and not spicy enough it is got a lot of sauces that are thick with flour later at night i got stomachache from eating this crab broccoli is very nicely made though to me i tried long beach black pepper crab and that was a lot better than this one but this one has better view of the river and more romantic seating,Negative
jumbo-seafood,something of a singapore institution this is one of a small chain currently six of a seafood restaurants with a small cluster of them around the singapore river as you might expect the menu is mainly fish and seafood one signature dish is the chili crab which was good but not exceptional expect to order a selection of smaller dishes and one or two bigger ones if you are in a party although to be honest i would say on our visit the food was hit and miss there is plenty to tempt here and a very real danger of grossly overordering hits included baby squid and a surprisingly gamey peking duck misses included salted egg shrimp undercooked batter more akin to unfinished scrambled egg and scallop and yam fritters strangely boring pucks of brown matter around soft and tasteless scallops expect to pay about sgd person including drinks it is really quite reasonable,Positive
jumbo-seafood,so good but we were so full after my singaporean friends were hankering to take me out to go eat chili crab even though i had already had it the last time i was there and one of them had been eating crabs the  previous days as well on a friend is suggestion we went to jumbo seafood i was warned that it could be very busy and i might have to wait but when i got there and asked for a table of three they mysteriously found a table for me among the huge crowd of filled up tables chili crab tastes as good as i remember good meaty chunks in the claws and the shell had a good amount of crab fat still in it mmmmantou get this and dip it in the crab sauce fried rice standardcold dishes at this point we were so full that i barely even cared anymore but they did have the chinese cold spiced beef that i always love i also got myself an italian apple sparkling soda which was quite delicious bill was fairly reasonable crab is always decently expensive so splitting among  is not a bad idea overall lives up to its reputation,Positive
jumbo-seafood,so what is the big deal we were told that we had to taste the chili crab at jumbo in singapore so we did overrated skip it is expensive and not tasty we ordered chili crab and it is not tasty it comes in a huge pot full of sloppy sauce that was waaaaayyyy too sweet and not nearly spicy enough it is so difficult and messy to eat and not worth the effort we also ordered the much recommended cereal shrimp this was also way too sweet it is basically shrimp that is breaded in a sort of sweet granola like cereal the shrimp itself was fresh and tasty but the cereal was far too sweet we ordered the taro yam sea scallops it was a sea scallop sandwiched around taro yam and deep fried it was okay but some folks in our party thought it was a bit too mushy we got a tofu mushroom dish it was not all that good skip the fried rice was okay the rice was a bit undercooked go to din tai fung for the fried rice all in all not impressed then we get the bill holy sh t it was  per crab it was the size of a california dungeness we got   for  people and we did not finish it did not taste good and too messy yes tea and peanuts are not free but what is a few dollars when the crab is so exorbitant skip,Negative
jumbo-seafood,i came by myself so i did not get the chili crab but instead i ordered the fried seafood mee goreng baby gai lan and jellyfish pretty much enough food for three people haha everything was delicious but pretty pricey as this chain has become fairly touristy fair warnings wait times are long,Positive
jumbo-seafood,this is a must go to when in singapore the chili crab is the best the restaurant is situated right alongside the river in clarke quay so you get a good view while you chow down on some good seafood the service could have been better as we had to flag down and ask for things a few times but it was not so bad one thing to make sure of is to make a reservation well in advance if you cannot make a reservation try showing up about  mins before opening you should be able to get a table right away,Positive
jumbo-seafood,very crowded as it caters to the tourist crowd make a reservation if you can definitely worth checking out if it is your first time in singapore had the chili crab black pepper crab mee goreng and kangkong with sambal the black pepper crab is excellent and while the chili crab is good i think long beach chili crab is more to my taste jumbo tastes a bit sweeter while long beach tends to be a bit spicier the noodles and the kangkong were delicious too the service is some of the best i have seen at a restaurant in singapore there is plenty of waitstaff and they are all very attentive and responsive without hovering if you are a tourist or wanting to have a nice dinner out this is a great place to eat these things while enjoying a great view of clarke quay if you are going to be in singapore for a while get the black pepper crab and find the rest elsewhere it is pricey due to the location,Positive
jumbo-seafood,food  stars service negative  stars atmosphere  stars had friends visiting from out of town and everyone i spoke to said we must go to jumbo is i had heard about the long wait lines but since we were walking around clarke quay i thought we would try it anyway we put ourselves down and were sent a sms fairly quickly which was good because we were all starving right off the bat i knew the service was going to suck we had to flag down a waitress  times for another menu and asked for water at least  times we ordered a bottle of wine and they brought it out with the glasses sat it right behind our table and left not opening it at all i almost got up and opened it myself and starting pouring but i did not have a wine cork on me drats food came out in a weird order first was the broccoli with garlic so good then came our crispy prawns in sweet and sour also excellent and then the fried rice with seafood really good they were out of a lot of the things i wanted i am looking at you drunken prawns but the food was solid our waiter on the otherhand was awful one thing is his english was not great so i do not he really understood what i needed we also waited for the bill for at least  minutes go for the food not the service,Positive
jumbo-seafood,touristy and busy but conveniently situated in clarke quay we were lucky we did not have to wait for a table as we were open to sharing a round table with  other strangers we were there for good crab so did not care we ordered one chili crab and  mantous fried bread for dipping the delicious sauce and a small order of cereal prawns split between two people it was more than enough for us as we ate it all although we might have been able to eat more but we were sitting outside and it was hot humid uncomfortable and definitely changed our usual appetites we had previously asked if we could sit indoors and still share tables but the waitress said no the chili crab was so good it was sweet with a kick normally i cannot handle spice and i might have been struggling with my mouth feeling like it was on fire but the crab was too good to pass up however for people who can handle spice this will be nothing for you mantous were perfect for dipping in the chili crab sauce the cereal prawns were good but by then i was getting so stuffed that i did not enjoy as much food was good but my complaints are just that the service was not good they are not attentive nor friendly they nickel and dime you for everything including the peanuts and tea they place on the table for their customers they should really not give peanuts unless it is requested because tourists or non regulars will not be aware and see that their are additional charges on their bill just seems sneaky and shady,Negative
jumbo-seafood,tourist trap food quality is so so having tasted both chilli crab and black pepper crab i prefer the black pepper crab because chilli crab seems to use a lot of ketchup and is too sweet for my taste service is poor on our recent visit the server kept coming over to take away empty or not quite empty dishes on the table one by one great way to make sure your guests get annoyed and leave within minutes i reckon expensive we spent s  on a dinner for three including one black pepper crab some seafood tofu dish that tasted a bit off a vegetable dish rice and a jug of tiger beer disappointing beer for disappointing food,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the chili crab is excellent and should be gotten with the rolls lots and lots of rolls my husband and i split one crab with an appetizer and it was plenty of food definitely going back the next time we are there,Positive
jumbo-seafood,first time in singapore and i know that everyone is recommending chili crab to try jumbo seafood is extremely popular and busy place and everyone is asking for chili crab we ordered chili and black pepper prawns instead to avoid messinf around with crabs great taste so flavorful plus fried rice was quite good too perhaps the place is too comnercialized caters to tourists and there are better and smaller local seafood places but it was excellent meal,Positive
jumbo-seafood,i ordered  crabs  of their famous chili crab and  black pepper crab  bowls of rice  water and  hot tea total came out to s  ridiculously expensive for  crabs i feel like it is a tourist trap rather than must try in singapore the service was ridiculous in this specific location because it took more than  min to get the food took about  min to get my water after having asked nd time the chili sauce in the crab is good but nothing like it will blow you out of water or anything the black pepper crab is very peppery and hot if you dine outside goodluck i will not recommand anyone to try this place i would expect better service if i am going to be spending that much money,Negative
jumbo-seafood,so what if this place is for tourists it is delicious it is a great location so you can stuff yourself with seafood bits and then walk around make a reservation or be ready to stand in a long queue it is clean inside the staff is friendly and very efficient plates are cleared and swapped regularly drinks refilled dishes brought in a timely manner and coursed of course you have to get chili crab do not forget the wee fried buns to dip in the chili sauce that is half the fun i know this place is famous for the crab but i love the pumpkin shrimp it is full of flavor and has crisp veggies underneath it is easily my favorite dish here the salted egg shrimp are good too if your group is big enough order the whole duck they prepare it table side the crispy skin is removed and sliced then rolled in cigars the rest is chopped and served on a platter the flavor is great deep and smokey i have never had any room for dessert when we eat here too much seafood in the way,Positive
jumbo-seafood,unsafe food quality and rude service we ordered chilli crab at  per kilo at that price i would expect high quality when the crab arrived one of the claws smelled strongly of ammonia and one of the leg segments was ice cold when we complained the manager denied being able to smell the rotten meat and assured me that they sell hundreds of kilos of crab every day so somehow that should reassure me they would not offer a refund and were very rude if i become ill i do not know the protocol to get justice on this establishment i lived in singapore for  years and this is the worst experience i have had,Negative
jumbo-seafood,perfect lunch ordered the prawns in salted egg as a starter there was a lot very filling but still room for the black pepper crab this was delicious a must for pepper fans i love coming here when in singapore,Positive
jumbo-seafood,one of the best places to try singapore is famous dish chilli crab especially if you are a tourist this is because jumbo is located in easy to access areas for tourists including this branch directly opposite clarke quay so you will have a great view of clarke quay especially at night every time i have guests in town i will try bringing them here or to the dempsey outlet etc one of the reasons is because overall the food is decent and the price is more attractive than it is upper tier competitors the unfortunate part is that since this location is immensely popular with tourists you will have to reserve seats at least two days in advance especially for the weekend dinners some bright spark food reviewer from japan and korea wrote about jumbo in their travel guidebooks therefore you will always find japanese and korean tourists swarming in lines for the tasty crab recommendations chilli crab of course together with the mantou fried buns at least  per pax recommended to dip into the succulent chilli sauce bamboo clams tofu with seaweed tips you can choose which crab choose the normal ones it is already big enough so you do not have to choose the alasakan ones which will cost you a bomb oh yes this being a chinese restaurant do not expect the service to be good you have been warned,Positive
jumbo-seafood,not as expected we ordered one alaska crab with chili and salt egg flavor it seems really big but it cheated us the crab meat was so little and it was very possible to give us two different crabs one was fatter and the other starved to die,Negative
jumbo-seafood,reknowned for this chili crab it was in deed delicious we we are say by the river and boy what a good view food is consistently good so i definitely enjoy coming here and i always book too crowded not to a bit on the pricey side so not an everyday affair they do charge extra for nuts and wet towelettes without really making you aware on this night i went they already had everything on the table so it was hard to say no once it was there so definitely take your own towel or wet wipes cause you will need them,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the food was decent i had a small chili crab a small black pepper crab and a couple of side dishes by small i meant somewhere around kg most crabs are approximately  kg well the chili crab is sauce was awesome but the crabmeat was lackluster i much preferred the black pepper crabmeat which was pretty tasty unfortunately my otherwise rather pleasant experience was the ruined by jumbo is shady business practices first up a chinese family beside me was almost duped into buying wasting an alaskan crab on a chili crab dish luckily they asked for the prices and declined when it was  they settled on the standard crabs after they left a korean couple took their place at the table beside mine as they were browsing through the menu i gave them a few tips on which crabs to order to prevent a repeat of the alaskan ripoff when the manager came over to take their order i just could not believe my ears he recommended they grab two freaking crabs each that is just not right i jumped in and told these innocent tourists to grab one to share and then another if it is not enough the manager gave me the evil eye and proceeded to explain that some people could eat two crabs bullshit the smallest crabs are at least kg  lbs and these folks ordered side dishes too since this business allows such unscrupulous upselling it makes one wonder if they are an ethical business if the crabs bought were fresh if they were actually  kg if they were from the same crab or dead pieces from various crabs i have no answer except this restaurant ai not worth it i am paying  for a meal of two i want unquestionable good crabs service and business practices to boot folks search for no signboard seafood restaurant at geylang on yelp if you want awesome crabs with huge bang for your buck you are welcome,Negative
jumbo-seafood,make sure you book as this place is very popular there is another jumbo only minutes walk in the event this one is full,Positive
jumbo-seafood,the food here is so amazingly good that it overcame some slight service issues and the lack of peking duck to earn it is five stars the highlight of the meal being the amazing chili crab with a sauce masala that is like crack and will have you licking the crab shell the almost equally tasty pepper crab is phenomenal as well but not as saucy we ordered fried and steamed buns and fried rice both of which are perfect accompaniments for soaking up every last drop of chili crab sauce we also ordered sticky tender melt of the bone pork bbq spare ribs and fried shrimp in pumpkin sauce that were both standouts as well the peanuts with chili sauce was a nice appetizer touch the other jumbo seafood apparently has peking duck but this one does not not sure of the reasoning the service was mostly attentive and hovered around well but communication was at times difficult never the less a truly fantastic meal and one to remember,Positive
jumbo-seafood,great crab and great people watching this place hustles one crab was enough for three of us the fried rice seemed like an unnecessary filler but turned out to be worth eating all on its own we were told that it would be a long wait but when we showed up and were willing to sit in the smoker is section we got a table right away the service was just as good and sitting so close to our neighbors made for instant friendships the grab is famous and at other locations it can be too ketchupy this place may not be located out on the sea shore but the fake vegas feel has its own charm the crab is actually better,Positive
jumbo-seafood,loud chaotic expensive tourist trap if you really want chili crab go to roland is where it was invented and where the locals go to eat it,Negative
jumbo-seafood,we had the set menu s  for two we had   hours to eat prior to our river cruise the service was so slow we were only served three of our five courses in that time every other table came ate and left while we were there we had to take the prawns to go and eat them cold that evening the lobster salad sounded great but only had slivers of lobster in a mayonnaise dressing on top of cube dragon fruit the ratio was  fruit and  lobster the chili crab was outstanding as was the rice with shrimp too bad we did not get to eat the prawns when they were warm would recommend the chili crab but not the lobster,Negative
jumbo-seafood,i was in singapore for vacation and was told jumbo is was a must the restaurant is right along the river therefore it was crowded with tourists as the for the food well jumbo is knows it is in a tourist hotspot so the food is quite pricey our table had  adults and one child we did not order any alcohol or appetizers but our bill was about  the food was ok like any tourist we ordered the chili crab the seafood soup panko crusted shrimp and abalone i cannot say the food was memorable nothing about the food was spectacular if you want to pay a lot of money for average tasting food come eat here,Negative
jumbo-seafood,been there on march th  reservation logistics excellent though ive reserved at the riverwalk gallery they sent me to the riverpoint which is even more touristic staff very attentive so i got my table ordered my way through lobster dragonfruit salat too much mayo hardly found the lobster deep fried baby squids nice fried to death and drowned in caramelized sugar and giant shrimps grilled with a soja reduction they were at my expectation the traditioal pepper crab i knew and left aside this time the wine ordered they have an amazing wine window at the entry its just a window was served way too late and warm a bordeaux blanc what a pity i understand that they can handle chilled tiger beer its the predominant order but at least a couple of bottles of white wine should find their place in the fridge so in a word this was the second time since  and definitely the last the offer isnt worth the price however staff service logistics location waterfront are impressive but the food isnt sorry,Negative
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,finally managed to make it here on a weekend at noon the broth is really flavorful maybe a little too rich actually the noodles are excellent and absorb the soup really nicely the rest of the ingredients are par for the course quite reasonably priced at  a bowl likely one of the best ramen places in singapore taking a star off for the long queues and lack of card payment,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,came here on a thursday at approximately  am it was pretty empty and was ushered to seat on the commune table as i was on my own without much hesitation i ordered the tonkotsu ramen with flavored egg and without black fungus for beverage i ordered green tea cola food came within  minutes the broth was not as rich in flavor as i would like it to be the noodles were in between of soft and hard and it delivered like what others commented this place can get crowded during peak hours and it was difficult to head out after meals service was inconsistent and price wise was reasonable overall i still prefer their kani king chain,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,this is to me the best ramen in town been eating here for  years and never being dissapointed a part from queue for quite long in the peak time everything is great,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,this the oldest and most popular outlet of the ramen keisuke chain it is located at the orchid hotel next to the another well known japanese restaurant teppei the outlet is very small with limited dine in area seats are very close to each other do take note that only cash payment is accepted here there is no nets or credit card payment available here similar to other outlets there was free flow hard boiled eggs and marinated bean sprouts to help yourself to there was also sesame seeds to add flavour to the ramen one could customize the ramen as similar to other outlets the table was very small barely had enough space for the food and the condiments on it tonkotsu ramen   the pork soup base was rich and creamy one would also add the grounded sesame seeds and bonito flakes to the ramen for a stronger flavour the dish was such as pick me up for a cold night that one would forget about dining in such a small narrow table,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,there are already lots of positive reviews already my experience here agree with their findings we had the spicy ramen with everything and the black ramen without everything i ate  eggs and my gf ate  eggs i ate almost halve of the free beansprouts too i am not sure if they made my money this time but i sure did enjoy my meal tonight i hope they remain in business so i can come back again,Negative
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,i was there around  pm and there were about  person in front of me waited less than  mins not bad the size of the shop is not big people tends not to sit long like other reviews mentioned unlimited supply of free boiled eggs and bean sprouts you cannot eat much anyway i have ordered a tonkotsu king ramen with seaweed the noodle texture is just right and the taste of the soap is good not too oily i did not give  stars because the soup is not hot temperature enough service is excellent very polite i was impressed by though quite a bit of people queuing outside they still kept refilling the water and no intention to kick you out after you finished most of us very discipline eat and go i will come back to this ramen place next time worth to try if you never been there,Negative
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,you need to get lucky when you visit keisuke as there is always an endless queue at this place during meal times and working in the area i attest to that personally as someone who has witness these queues for the last year or so there is not a walk to the mrt station at the end of the day that i do not see a snaking queue outside this outlet i got lucky on two separate occasions in fact once at lunch and the second time at dinner today i say lucky because while there was a queue the wait was not too long we is kipped the queue during lunch because we had a table for our smaller group size opened up at dinner today we did have to wait for a bit minutes but again were lucky to skip past a group in front of us so my tip here would be to go only in groups of  the shop is rather small so they have more  seaters which gives you a higher chance of a shorter wait i tried both the red spicy and black spicy tonkotsu noodles on the respective visits added all ingredients in the red and just an additional egg for the black cause dinner needs to be a small meal p i have to say that while i loved both soup bases their chashu is rather inconsistent i loved the melt in your mouth piece that i got at dinner compared to the  rather tendon filled tough pieces that i got when i went for lunch i think it is again all about luck when you done here depending on the day etc because the same happened for my egg japanese ramen eggs are notoriously awesome because of its yolk consistency at least for it it is and the egg that i had at lunch was disappointing because it was more hard boiled than runny my colleague on the other hand had a perfectly runny egg but i guess that was redeemed by the egg that i got when i went for dinner they had free hard boiled eggs at the table as well as marinated bean sprouts that i would definitely recommend everyone to try i guess for quite a number of people this is a highlight though i would not concur as most of the ramen places in the tanjong pagar area have this free hard boiled egg perk the food here is really good when you get lucky which is why the  stars it lacks consistency in both the broth my dinner partner had been here before but he had horrible tasting broth when we went for dinner his feedback was that it was a lot better than his first try and their ingredients which i feel is really sad because every visit could be a hit or miss keisuke tonkotsu has a sister branch nearby in am serving the ramen with a chicken based broth instead which i hope to go try someday,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,came here for a late lunch so avoid the long queue yay saw that they actually provided free barley for customers who are waiting in line to help themselves to they even left several fans in case it get too hot that is nice i ordered black spicy ramen the broth was thick and savory i opted for the noodle as normal texture so that is nice for me the soup was not spicy at all just a hint of it the pork slices were thick and flavourful but a little tough i opted for additional flavour egg and it was good soft seasoned at the yoke free beans sprout i thought it would be plain boiled bean sprouts but i was surprised to find a small jar of bean sprout goodness left on the table for your own service their bean sprouts were boiled and seasoned with sesame spicy oil and something yummy i only know i cannot stop eating that i wanted to whack the free eggs too but was way too full from the free bean sprouts to do so will return if in the area just to whack the bean sprouts again,Negative
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,ate here several times even before yelp was created and now that i have eaten it i am reminded of yelping and thus here is my review you can read the rest of the reviews they are largely accurate except for the criticism maybe they had blocked nose and hence their sense of taste went haywire haha i would say that i have never tasted any broth as thick and flavorful as keisuke is orchid hotel in singapore in addition you get to have a multi sensory experience space is cramped a la japan you crush some sesame seeds and the aroma fills the shop technically you should go in eat fast and get out fast similar to japan correct me if i am wrong of course you can eat slowly to spend more time in the shop but why deprive others of their noodles dtldr broth thick noodle ramen qq springy meat is nice one of the best ramens i have ever eaten and for that price yeaaaaa,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,we came here on a friday afternoon around pm and the place was not very busy at that time we were quickly seated and given a checklist menu to order our ramen i had the classic tonkotsu king ramen with the flavored egg and the normal authentic japanese taste as stated on menu while we waited there was a large bowl of hard boiled eggs for us to eat this is what my gf remembered as her favorite thing about this place when the ramen came out the broth was deliciously rich and thick definitely the best part of the ramen the noodles were good as was the soft boiled flavored egg i was expecting a little more sides and the chasyu was not served the way i normally like it i like mine melt in your mouth soft but it was ok would definitely come back and try their spicy ramen on a next visit to singapore i liked the green tea cola in a bottle as well,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,my favorite ramen in singapore the bowls are not perfect perfect ramen should have perfect broth noodles charsiew and keisuke only gets   of these down pat but it is never disappointed me since i was first brought here  years ago speaking of the   things this chain of keisuke and likely the others as well though i can only speak for paya lebar bugis village branches has such deliciously milky and rich broth their menu is simple with the original or black pepper or red pepper chili oil versions i ordered the black version but i honestly do not see much difference between them they are both really good the noodles are also great al dente not too soft not too chewy delicious it is not the sapporo style ones that resemble instant ramen but the straight cut hakata style just like ippudo is if you have a bigger eater definitely order extra ramen for a few bucks also i did not list the flavored egg as one of my criteria for perfect ramen since its pretty much a basic pre requisite keisuke is is perfect and hits the spot the charsiew is a little meh nothing special the little extra perk that keisuke offers is the free flow bean sprouts salad hard boiled eggs some people go really crazy on the hard boiled eggs and i do not really understand why but to each his own i am a huge fan of the bean sprouts they taste slightly spicy and sweet and are so addictive i gulp down whole bunches of these with my noodles i am not kidding sometimes i literally finish half the container at my table kind of strange but this is definitely one of my favorite things about keisuke,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,nearly perfect blend of flavor and spice being a food simpleton i tried the spicy red ramen with none of the extra accouterments i wish the broth had a slightly more pork fat taste but i had a hard enough time finishing it as it came because i stuffed myself silly like the good little tourist i am on peanuts from long bar while i waited  minutes for my drink i am giving  stars because i specifically requested a medium pork fat flavor expecting the strong option to overwhelm the spice i regret that decision but it was still a mighty fine bowl of ramen my first in  months thanks keisuke,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,yelp brought me here i was in sg on holiday and was excited to see sg on yelp i walked here from where i stayed at in clarke quay i waited a good  mins in line and it prob would have been a longer wait if i was eating with someone party of  i counted about  chairs so it is small hence the long line you preorder on paper while waiting so when you get seated your order comes right out i am not a ramen fan but i did eat everything i had the original with everything what i did not like was the customer service no one came to fill up my water what is up with that i guess they are too busy trying to flip tables if you are in sg and love ramen come here but come early to avoid the long line,Negative
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,any day can be a ramen day for me i have been returning for many good bowls of delicious hot ramen in this store the only irks is you have to share those tiny tables and the space is rather tight hence the line is long at times but come early to avoid it pros free bean sprouts and hard boiled eggs for allsapporo bottled beer available hereayataka green tea available herethe pork broth is goodthe egg is delicious that comes at cons you gotta pay by either cash or nets credit card is not available here,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,welp what a disappointment but let is start with what went well the broth is great and is how a good tonkotsu broth should be thick rich and extremely flavorful for all  types normal black peppery spicy and red chilli spicy the oils ground sesame seeds went well with it the noodle was nice and firm the portion of meat was great for   it came with all the good sides including   big slices of pork and that is exactly when things went to crap those big slices of pork oh they held so much promise but the first warning sign came when i noticed that any signs of the good ole usual layers of fats seem to be missing strange maybe they were using a lean cut but nope biting into it was like gnawing into a gunny sack dry oh god so tough flavorless it was awful enough to spoil the meal for me i guess the chef has clearly way way waaaay over cooked the meat making it extra tough and dry and of course melting all the fats away in short i would sorta recommend this place if you are vegetarian and looking for some great ramen and broth however if you like me find the pork to be an extremely integral part of a good tonkotsu ramen i would recommend you stay far far away,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,a solid choice i took the japanese style ramen and it does taste like ramen in japan the concept with the all you can eat eggs is nice a great value for money place,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,cash only i find that the portion is too little esp the noodles for extra portion its the noodles tasted great and the broth tasty small joint with usually a crowd for lunch we were suppose to line up with the other establishment but we just decided to come here due to long wait on the other side,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,my friend brought me to this place keisuke tonkotsu king for ramen recently what attracted me the most was the free flow of soft boiled eggs guys like me who are training up their body would need the extra protein boost the shop is rather small in scale but it makes the environment much more cozy queue is also quite long so people who want to go try the food should go early the soup is thick and full of flavor noodles are just nice and of large portion,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,one major complaint this place is way too small we were here right at pm when they opened and we managed to walk in straight away but the tiny space filled up almost immediately even before our noodles are served free flow of hard boiled eggs bean sprouts at each table is a nice touch but note that you do get a perfect onsen egg in your ramen so i would advise against bring too greedy with the free eggs ramen i prefer the original to the black broth the black version has a spiciness that reminds me of sichuan spice and i feel that it took away the sweetness of the amazing tonkotsu broth i would only go for the original next time the pork slice is nothing compared to santouka i did not finish mine order original with extra firm noodles and less oil that is my perfect bowl of ramen plus thank you yelp for finally allowing reviews to be posted via mobile app,Negative
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,delicious delicious i love good ramen and i am so happy my friend recommended keisuke i opted for the spicy black king which was delicious i have had other ramen with black broth ramen dojo in san mateo ca but this one has a different flavor it is more black pepper y when they say spicy it is pepper spicy not chili oil burn your mouth spicy boiled eggs and bean sprouts are also offered at the table so eat up,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,came here after another super yelp elite party really wanted to get some food in the tummy and this place closed at pm it was perfect imagine hot soup in a really empty stomach at pm the best way to cure hunger i have to say the service was pleasant whilst waiting for our turn to get into the restaurant we were offered free japanese barley tea which was actually barley rice tea and we waited for a mere  minutes and we were in our waitress was great and got us settled easily what helped this place is that our orders were pre taken when we were waiting outside the restaurant to get in great concept we barely sat for  mins and our food arrived pictures were taken and it was then time to eat while this is a good place for ramen there are better ones the broth did not speak much to me and i really had wanted to try the lobster king ramen but it was not available here only at their clarke quay branch well i would have to give it a taste soon ill be back,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,so my quest to look for a decent bowl of ramen in singapore despite what you think of this metropolitan city where you can find almost every cuisine readily available it is not that easy to find very good ramen took me to this place where i dedicated a good part of my friday night post work at queuing that is be sure to come ready to queue at this little outlet or the one nearby if it helps they serve you green tea and you can order your ramen first so your wait is shortened just by a little naturally i was very hungry and full of expectation when my dinner partner and i were finally showed in ramen is served very quickly along with your personal stash of beansprouts and boiled eggs so that was a relief after the long wait i picked the pepper ramen with regular soup broth and regular ramen eat the way japanese do is my battle plan for the day go for the regular soup broth if you like me are a fan of thick and rich broth which are just that slight bit salty i love the way the flavours melt into the noodles i would not go for the pepper flavour thought is was a little unncessary and will head straight for the original the next trip yes a next trip is already planned if you are one for bites on the side like gyozas with your ramen head for their other branch i heard the gyozas are fabulous will be back to report on it,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,i was stunned to find myself even a degree less than obsessed with tonkatsu king after my orgasmic experience at tori king i was prepared to be charmed and then wholly seduced by chef keisuke takeda is take on tonkatsu my most favorite variety of ramen as with tori king the noodles i ordered hard were perfect and the free eggs and bean sprouts were great alas it was the broth that took me aback although i ordered the richness of the broth and the chicken oil both normal the broth was filled with many small brazen globules of fat try as i did i was unable to convince myself that it was simply another way to get collagen to my lips and though the overall flavor was nice i had trouble truly bonding with my bowl of ramen for the time it took to get into the small eatery i am not sure i would wait in line again if i do go back i am going to order a lighter broth parting thought i am still planning to try the outlet in millenia walk and will definitely be back to tori king,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,we loved this place keisuke tonkotsu king the flavor of the soup and ramen was fantastic we felt the flavor was what its suppose to be ramen was served and cooked at the right texture and moment eventhough we had to wait for a moment in line but it was worth the wait during lunch time would definitely be back next time,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,this is my go to ramen store i love their thick broth and side bean sprout you have the options to choose the saltiness and the oiliness of the broth which is great their flavor eggs are so yummy one bowl is around  before tax and service charge which is on the lower end for ramen considering they give out free eggs and bean sprouts,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,i had passed by this place many times and seen a long queue outside at lunch and dinner so i figured i definitely have to try it due to the long queue outside i made sure i went early or lunch and still had to wait still the wait was not long as the turnover rate is quite high and people just eat and leave quickly the place is really small and can seat only about ish people ambience here is not fantastic and it is not a place to hang around for a drink after you just eat and go while i was waiting in the line i was given a menu to choose between the basic tonkotsu the black spicy or the red spicy ramen i picked the basic tonkotsu ramen special that came with all the toppings because i am greedy like that you get more for a top of a few dollars they take your order while you are in line at last we managed to get seats near the counter but it was interminably hot perhaps my corner did not get much air circulation or maybe we were just too near the counter where they prepared food but it did get uncomfortable my bowl arrived still steaming with a large sheet of seaweed sticking out on one side i pushed the seaweed into the thick broth and mixed everything up it was mouthwateringly fragrantthough it was unpleasant sweating over my bowl of ramen i still enjoyed it immensely the ramen noodles were not the best but they were springy just the way i like it the soup is probably one of the most authentic i have had in singapore really thick and milky even if it was a bit salty be sure to grind your own sesame into the broth for an enhanced flavour it definitely makes it taste yummier i found the char siew meat a little tough but the egg with the liquid yolk was just divine i really like those eggs but i found it hard to finish up all the soup i normally do at other ramen places but the soup here was a little too rich to drink by itself or maybe i just was not in the mood that day they also serve free hard boiled eggs on the table free flow you can eat as many hard boiled eggs as you want i had  with my leftover soup and then gave up but left with a very full stomach feeling really satisfied with the meal here,Negative
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,as a japanese who just relocated to singapore i would say this ramen place serves something very similar to what i would expect in tokyo just like everyone else mentioned be ready to queue that is what local ppl say here in singapore having brought up in california i just say be ready to stand in line upon arrival if you are a huge ramen fan i think it is worth it you can personalize your ramen the way you want it to be just make sure you remember what your combination was so that when the waiter brings you a bowl you know you have the right one and they speak with the local accent so be ready to listen and focus one thing i would like to do next time is that they have all you can eat hard boiled eggs at each table instead of ordering flavored egg for your ramen i think this will work if you just drop the regular hard boiled egg the free ones and let it sink in your ramen for a while that would take a few sg off your bill a bit on the expensive side but i think they are staying true to the japanese style,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,wow seems like this ramen is really damn popular not that there is no good reason for this though i absolutely love the pork broth here whether it is the black red or original all are damn tasty savoury yet not oily the flavoured egg was decent as well but i would say one major disappointment was the meat the meat was tough and cold and i also loved the interior of the place cosy and most say small with lots of traditional ramen shop decor i also loved that they played many arashi songs when i was there pardon me for the fangirl moment haha so overall i am still willing to give it a second chance,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,i am giving a  specifically on the strengths of the black version which i adore i adore it almost as much as i like the nantsuttei one apples and oranges though it is rich and almost reminiscent of your favourite black pepper crab memory except here you can slurp is all up quite happily i also prefer the noodles here you can specify soft normal or hard for noodle texture i have a distinct preference for crunchy thin noodles and while i do like ippudo and santouka and all the rest tonkotsu king is noodles win for me the rest of them leave me full and never wanting any more tonkotsu king is noodles always make me order kaedama  for extra noodles leave some soup for it slurp it is more central than most of the other ramen hotspots and the queue tends to be manageable to be fair i would not know about the regular version and the red version but the black one is quite something,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,keisuke tonkotsu king will probably be amongst the top  places slapped with a must try within  month command if you are working in the tanjong pagar area this little nook is more affectionately known as the orchid hotel ramen place a lazy moniker referring to the building it is situated in the place is always packed at lunchtime with a line of people sitting patiently on itsy bitsy stools that rests against the glass of its shop front ramen here is taken extremely seriously and you get to make decisions like how hard you would like the noodles to be what level of spiciness your broth should be and so on the waitress leaves you to ruminate over you choices with a slip of paper and pencil and returns to hustle you to your seat when it is ready you always enter to a couple of shouts from the kitchen welcoming you in traditional japanese fashion and soon a steaming bowl of ramen is plonked before you the soup is flavourful but always a tad too oily for my liking and the slices of meat that come along with it are also much too tough i do however enjoy their noodles because it is always springy and never overcooked mention this place and you will definitely be told about how your ramen is accompanied with free flow of eggs that is probably the most exciting bit of news for me,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,this popular ramen stop is located a couple minutes from tanjong pagar mrt station exit tanjong pagar road and is adjoined to orchid hotel you will often see a string of people waiting to get in we went on a sunday night at around pm and while bustling we only waited about ten minutes for a seat the small restaurant seats about  odd people and serves ramen that is pretty much it but you do get to make your own when queuing outside the waitress will hand you a piece of paper and you tick the boxes do you want your ramen soft normal or hard do you want to have light chicken oil or do you prefer your soup more artery inducing after ticking the boxes you hand it to the waitress and wait for your turn to be seated we waited around ten minutes with about four groups of people ahead of us the ramen is served pretty much the moment you sit down so it ticks the box for fast service is it good well i think there are better ramen places in singapore but for the bargain hunter there is a free flow of eggs and you also get to ground your own sesame seeds in cute bowls to bring out the soup is flavour due to the speed and high volume i thought the broth lacked consistency i got mine with light chicken oil but the noodles i selected normal were just the right texture and flavour altogether we paid about  for two bowls of ramen including everything which comes up to about  each that does not make it the cheapest place but so i would give it an average rating for value for money and taste,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,it is not uncommon to see long queues outside this quaint and cosy little ramen place tucked away in a corner of tanjong pagar but please do yourself a favour and join in the queue this place is one of my top places to go to for ramen and they provide a free flow of hard boiled eggs what is there not to love let me first state my ramen preferences i like bouncy noodles in a broth that is not too rich not gravy like and oily with a slice of char siew that contains enough fat to melt in your mouth and a well cooked flavoured egg of course i had the black spicy ramen on my last visit and it almost met all of my requirements i was happy with the noodles and the broth but found it a tad oily for my tastes the char siew was perfect and reminded me of the ones i have had in japan i have had better flavoured eggs elsewhere tampopo but overall this is a pretty decent place to go to for ramen and to bask in an authentic japanese ramen bar setting,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,this outlet of keisuke specializes in tonkotsu ramen which is made from a rich milky pork broth keeping things simple they have  flavors to pick from original black spicy and red spicy black spicy is a pepper based spice while red spicy is a fresh chili paste the first thing i heard about keisuke was their free flow boiled eggs and seasoned bean sprouts that kinda contributed to the long queue i guess not that much of a cheapo to go for such stuff especially since bean sprouts are the bane of my life the ramen could be easily customized using the order form kinda idiot proof i went for the original with seaweed and flavored egg and a little bit of spring onions do not quite get who would go for the no char siew option despite the less oil option there were a lot of pieces of fats in my noodles i dutifully scooped out most of them s is spicy red ramen with normal oil level i did not quite like the red spicy flavor as it was more of a dull piquantness than a savory one the original broth was very rich and flavorful but it was also rather salty our verdict on the ramen it is not bad we concluded that the broth was on the same level as santouka is or better santouka happens to be his favorite ramen in singapore i was not too pleased with the char siew though as it was drier and tougher than the high quality pork cheeks that we are used to at santouka but the egg simply awesome i could inhale  of these realistically speaking nice gooey texture in the middle and the soy infusion right to the center of the egg lovely i would not mind coming back for ramen if the queue is not insane certainly one of the better ramens around,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,it is just another noodle soup  sgd for an average lunch ramen is not good value for money to me pork quality not really good small space and low end service probably people are more hyped up by the crowd outside rather than the food and the price,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,any meal that starts with a big bowl of eggs in the middle of the table is bound to end well the same can also be said for a restaurant that you can find by following a cacophony of slurping as you may have guessed both of these things proved true at keisuke tonkotsu king and while we could debate for days about the authenticity of the chasyu or whether better shio shoyu or kira miso can be found it is really the amazing amazing tonkotsu that made this spot queue worthy it is all customisable which i loved not just your preferred extras but your noodle texture any ingredients you do not want floating around in there the style and strength of your broth red spicy please and your oil level and oh that amazing oil it is like they picked up those piggy bones and wrung them out into a bowl the size of my face it was milky and delicious and for a moment i forgot that i was about to step back outside into  degree heat they truly do churn through the queue so do not expect it to be a leisurely lunch my advice get there early slurp away and move on so the next person waiting can enjoy this deliciousness,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,love this ramen slurpworthy soup and perfect noodles and of course you get free flow sprouts and eggs,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,ramen like choosing a car watch or spouse is all about personal taste and personally i like taste i like so much taste that that for me keisuke tonkotsu king ramen is the place for me when it comes to ramen i do not think you can find another tonkotsu pork based broth place where the soup is as rich as oily and as fatty yup you heard that right while a few of the other reviews have commented that the soup here is too oily i am sayin that is why i love it fat is flavour say it with me fat is flavour and at keisuke tonkotsu king the soup has visible pieces of flavour floating it it just the way i like it like the more serious ramen places you find in singapore and indeed overseas you choose the consistency of your noodles and then customise your soup if it is your first time do not be shy go for the middle option for everything do not ask for less oil fat is flavour do not forget the onsen egg is done perfectly there is a big basket of hard boiled eggs for you to help yourself you can grind your own sesame seeds there is beansprouts for you to add to your soup in terms of free condiments as far as i know no one comes close to this shop so be forewarned the soup is really rich kind of greasy and probably incredibly fattening it is not for everyone yet the queue is still always so long,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,there is a reason this place is called tonkotsu king it rules when it comes to tonkotsu broth i hate to queue wait in a line for food even if the food promises to be delicious but i am one that can be convinced by friends to try something once and luckily i was rewarded with one of the best bowls of ramen in singapore the free barley tea outside helps too the food the menu is simple and to the point only three flavors of ramen are served here with possible add ons of eggs extra pork or seaweed each bowl of ramen can be customized for noodle tenderness broth richness and chicken oil content while i declined any chicken oil i loved the al dente noodles and bold broth we got to try two of the three flavors and both broths were heavy with rich tonkotsu flavor i liked my spicy red tonkotsu broth the flavors here were mildly reminiscent of szechuan flavors with its red oil though not the same type of ma la flavor you can request fresh sesame seeds to grind in to your broth top this off with free hard boiled eggs and bean sprouts and you leave a very happy diner be warned that you may have to wait during peak lunch and dinner times and literally rub elbows with your fellow patrons but you will be happily slurping away when you get your ramen slurp on with the king,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,truly the king of the japanese ramen brothdo you know that there are two keisuke shops in singapore keisuke tokyo ramen at millenia walk and keisuke tonkotsu king at orchid hotel keisuke takeda is precisely known for his creation of very unusual soup bases cooked with prawns and crabs not the usual classic soup bases like shio miso or shoyu ironically keisuke ramen in singapore which initially started selling only the very unique prawn based flavour switched to selling the usual after customers feedback keisuke tonkotsu king the little ramen shop at tanjong pagar goes back to the basics there is always a queue here for the reasons that the ramen is really quite authentically delicious and the shop can only sit about twenty you can choose between the basic tonkotsu ramen   black spicy   or red spicy   i would suggest a tonkotsu ramen special all toppings   and you can also indicate if you want your soup to be light normal or strong while i may have preferred the noodles over at ippudo or marutama the char siew at santouka and the tamago at miharu the tonkotsu soup at keisuke is the best thick milky tasteful flavoursome and slightly salty i finished till the last drop the soup wins hands down you may still argue it is too salty,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,sadly it was too salty even though opted for normal tasted ordinary noodles were ok disappointed,Negative
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,omg amazing ramen cheap prices no wonder there is always a line this place offers delicious ramen best i have ever had in my live and i have tried many places in japan a bowls of ramen per   less than  pounds and a beer for   less than  pounds heaven on earth for just under  pounds if you are in sg go go now,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,having dined at  of their branches keisuke tori king keisuke tonkotsu king four seasons keisuke tokyo and gyoza king we thought it high time to visit the mothership where it all started we had  black spicy tonkotsu king   with flavoured egg  so thick the broth was practically viscous i could not finish this it was terribly cloying i should have ticked the light option for the soup base this needed to be watered down to half its viscosity  red spicy tonkotsu king   with the option of special topping  comprising a flavoured egg seaweed and stewed pork just as stodgy and the pork needed more flavour and stewing time the best part of the meal was free the marinated beansprouts that were totally refreshing lightly spiced and delicious,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,rich robust broths with loads of taste usually packed with loads of flavour the great thing is the ability to customise your order you can choose hard noodles soft noodles how rich you want your stock to be the amount of chicken oil etc and it comes in three variants the usual tonkotsu broth the tonkotsu broth with red chilli oil and the tonkotsu broth with black garlic oil all of them are good but just different the normal tonkotsu is just so porky and intense the black version features black peppercorns for a spicy kick and for contrast with the porky broth the red version is just as delicious rather intense in its spiciness and the eggs are done perfectly there is also free beansprouts and eggs to munch while you are waiting which thankfully is not long once you get in just love this place just do not like the long queue my ratings are determined by the class of goods services provided i e  stars represents the best in the industry for that particular class of goods services  stars represents excellent  stars represents ok and so on,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,this place is not as good as mentei ramen on robinson rd but it is cheaper and good ramen for value depending on what you add in the menu is simple enough you make your selection on a piece of paper with check boxes spicy vs non spicy ramen noodle firmness chicken oil amount and broth strength i went with a non spicy tonkotsu ramen with all normal selections for   plus service charge tax the best part was you get some sesame to grind and pour into your ramen and you also got free unlimited hard boiled eggs bean sprouts on the table the queue is usually quite long during lunch hour because it is quite a small place inside but my coworker and i went on a semi rainy friday pm and we happened to catch a window when there was basically no queue i am glad i have another good ramen lunch option around the tanjong pagar area,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,i truly recommend to select normal tonkotsu ramen not spicy one noodle is slightly different from other tonkotsu ramen restaurant e g ippudo and so on seat rotation is very slow so you must wait for around  to  mins on the weekend dinner time,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,good rich pork stock though i prefer tonkotsu from elsewhere the queues are long but move quickly partly a testament to how quickly the kitchen moves too it is very simple here pick the soup stock you want plain red or black the latter being spicy what condiments you want seaweed onsen egg charshu the degree of doneness of the noodles how much chicken fat you want protip fat is flavour and away you go if you need more flavour there are additional seasonings on the table omnomnom,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,when i am too lazy to navigate the nightmare traffic to mandarin gallery for ippudo is red bowl i go to tonkotsu king there is usually a queue but you should be able to get a table within half an hour i would not recommend for a big group to eat here they would be able to fit parties of   easily and quickly but any more and you might find yourself having to split up wait for a long time price is fair and you get to customise your ramen based on how much oil you would like in the broth type and strength of the broth hardness of the noodles and whether you would like seaweed or flavoured egg to go with or both in the name of efficiency you mark your preferences on a sheet while standing in line so your order gets sent to the kitchen when you reach the front of the queue there is a barrel of cool barley tea next the entrance for hungry thirsty contenders in the line a nice little gesture like this is always appreciated once inside there is plenty to occupy you while you wait for your steaming bowl which does not take very long conscientiously grind sesame peel your own hard boiled eggs or nibble on pickled bean sprouts i love that it feels a little like i am eating in a hole in wall noodle shop in japan when i am at tonkotsu i always get the black pepper bowl it is a good quick fix for when ippudo just seems too far away and too long a wait,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,keisuke is located at  tras link a  minute walking from tanjong pagar mrt it often has super long queues during lunch and dinner be prepared to queue for at least  minutes during its most busy period food wise the ramen is decent it is one of the better ramen restaurants located in tanjong pagar placed on the tables are unshelled eggs which you are suppose to shell while waiting for lunch to be served it provides good entertainment while waiting i would not recommend going there with a big crowd though getting a table might be impossible,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,one word shiok love the firmness of the ramen the crazy delicious black spicy soup and the tender slices of pork the complimentary hard boiled eggs and bean sprouts are also surprisingly very good and addictive i always eat a whole bunch of the bean sprouts as an appetizer however even though i usually indicate less oil the broth is still too oily for me i guess it is all part of the dish i would really like to eat this more often but these days the ramen is way too oily for my taste but if you love ramen i would totally recommend this yum,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,hands down the best ramen i have ever had and i will be thinking about this place forever first the all you can eat egg and bean spout salad salad was addicting and the ramen you can make it to your black with everything extra chewy noodle with intense favor the black crush sesame totally brings out the favor and the super rich thick broth was serious heavy and the perfectly poached egg to just send me over for more noodles please,Positive
keisuke-tonkotsu-king,heard from a friend about a ramen place close to tanjong pagar mrt which constantly have long line during lunch dinner hours at st i thought that it is just another ramen place which open during this recent japanese food invasion in singapore after reading the reviews here i decided to go during off hours to avoid any lines the place is sooo tiny no wonder there is always a line if it gets busy just a bit more you will be given a paper to construct your ramen how thick you want the soup how springy you want the noodle onion or not egg or not pork or not and also different kind of ramen regular black spicy and red spicy i chose the complete regular with normal soup and firmness the soup is pretty thick with visible fat floating around this is a good thing for me even for the normal the seaweed is in the shape of big rectangular cut peaking above the bowl the egg is runny once you break the white part and the ramen is springy if you think you want more ramen tell the waiter before you finish the soup there is an explanation on the wall about this pretty shiok ramen from this small place on a non touristy area,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,great ambiance and well extracted coffee,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,not really a fan of the food here pastries can be really dried out sometimes breakfast offerings too sweet coffee is uniformly terrific though especially the filter brews,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,overall i enjoyed my experience at cshh it is a quaint coffee shop and great for a quick bite i ordered the salmon toastie which was great they food was presented well and tasted good my only issue was the cold brew nitro coffee on tap i have had nitro beers and coffees before however this one was a bit flat other than that no complaints i would definitely return again for the food and maybe opt for a different drink instead,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,been to this place second time do not be duped by the hardware shop from outside it is a cool place for coffee and beer not many choice for dinner but they are all delicious i like their salmon donburi the price is slightly high but the ambience is cool,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,it is interesting to witness what is going on at jalan besar and its vicinity the neighbourhood is slowly changing hardware stores and workshops for cool hostels galleries and coffee shops chye seng huat hardware coffee is the perfect example of this process the building used to house hardware companies now it is a coffee bar gallery and roastery it is so hip it makes me feel like i am back on mexico city is ultra hipster neighbourhoods it has a very cool atmosphere complete with a turntable for vinyls actually they just plug a tablet into it but i would like to think it works industrial style benches free lo fi newspapers and a colourful friendly staff at the coffee bar they sell amazing coffee the cold brews are very good served in cute medicine bottles they even have cold brewed coffee on tap which is fresh and tasty i also tried an earl grey cheese cake which was superb prices are not surprisingly higher than on any average kopitiam but lower than most of those corporate coffee shops we all know so well some people admit it most of us do not but we all have a tiny little hipster deep inside us and that tiny little hipster loves this kind of coffee bars so why not embrace the hip and treat ourselves with high quality coffee this is a place worth visiting repeatedly,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,for the coffee lovers pretty basic with their coffee menu does have quite a good pastry cake selection even pastas and rosti as well was pretty satisfied with my latte though i would have preferred them to have syrup on their selfservice condiments counter i like my coffee sweet their lemonade was really well made too like a fizzy mojito without the alcohol the ambience and facade of a hardware store was also very interesting,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,from the same roaster as papa palheta also the roaster is name pulp and loysel is toy and the coffee here is the same quality but in a cooler and more hipster like setting of an old hardware store here they have a very nice cafe part as well as a roasting and tasting annex and some outdoor seating the coffee is good without being spectacular but the presentation of the filter coffee is very nice when they serve in cute little bottles the espresso based coffees are also good and the cakes and pastries are too good to not eat one or two or occasionally even more the food is standard cafe fare and i have been rather underwhelmed by the quality so would come here for the coffee the cakes and nice setting service is usually friendly and if you sit sit the bar it tends to be more talkative one drawback is the lack of free wifi but perhaps intentional to not have people sit around for too long,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,super cute little cafe really wonderful coffee and pastries the ambience and service was amazing great little hipster pocket in the city my only complaint would be that they did not have soy or almond milk will definitely be back for craft beer and pizza at night,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,reviewing the evening bar not the coffee i am sure papa palheta deserves their reputation but i am firmly in the nylon camp the beers were expensive as expected and nothing special my amber ale tasted like tiger with food colouring the special was a low alcohol lager infused with mandarin peel and tasted just like it sounded but it was to be fair  a pint there were only  choices and i wanted none of them i suspect there were bottled beers on offer one of the staff was sipping some but without a menu or any kind of visibility it would be hard to order them just down the road are char and  the former serves hobgoblin and the latter has decent home brews better options if beer is what you are after the dj is volume was too high so the evening ended in sore throats it is strange because there is no dance floor nor dancing at around pm the dj changed and the sound was pushed even higher at this point we were screaming at each other gave up after  minutes and moved on the place seems to be a lbgt cruising spot and at least a third of the audience was visibly lbgt as well as many on the staff the food looked like normal pub food fries mac n cheese etc i would rather eat at the numerous hawkers in fact that is what we did young and hipster crowd mostly many fashionable ang mohs loads of selfies and instagram maybe i am getting old,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,no hardware but they take their coffee very seriously and fun industrial feel wild mushroom pasta is excellent and the tuna salad is ok seating is limited and place is humming with hipsters and early thirty something is cold nitro coffee on tap is exactly what it sounds like but no alcohol worth a visit for sure,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,cshh coffee shop is quaint and boutique coffee is awesome and the cakes have good selections they even have nintendo games from year s era we will be back highly recommended for a first date meet,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,other reviews have covered all the basics the roastery the annex the food pastries and the like although few ever mention the small indie style shop on the second floor of the building offering small batch personal and home items the second floor gallery space is perfect for a lazy afternoon browse after enjoying a coffee and a spot of lunch at chye seng huat hardware while there are few other similarly designed spaces in singapore such as a r c or roasting their own beans such as common man and nylon the chye seng huat hardware space is my by far my favorite even if you do not opt for a baked good just a block away is the broadway hawker center ready to fill your post coffee tummy,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,food is average but coffee here is very good the reataurant looks like a hardware store from outside but it is a huge coffee thing inside beside the drink and food area there is a coffee selling shop inside a coffee making class on the second floor would def try the coffee making class when i have time,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,cold brew coffee was spot on strong smooth and served ice cold it was perfect space is very cool industrial vibes galore menu looks very unique and cool large display of sweet treads by the till the earl grey cheesecake looks yummy staff are informative and very friendly wish i lived near by,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,i will give it a  star for the conversion of a heritage building to a spacious cafe with micro roaster this cafe attracts both locals coffee enthusiast and expats on a weekend brunch as much as i love the space coffee wise it is too watery and milky for my liking,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,quite simply one of the better coffee places you can find in singapore the baristas take great pride in make the coffee just note i am not a fan of their nitro coffee thing the one where they brew their beer like a stout i would keep away if i were you,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,first time here and love it the service was very good everybody seems always in the mood i love my latte which had similar taste with tiong bahru bakery or penny university dont know if they are using the same beans the barista lady gave me different latte art yes i ordered  cuppa the french toast was delish i am not eating pork and i asked for a plain omelette and they kindly made it for my son with no hassle overall it was great i can see my self going back here soon,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,it is my go to place for coffee it serves the best coffee here love the snacks as well,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,walked straight passed chyesenghuathardware the first time super cute coffeebar their mini espresso with milk is a perfectpiccolo breakfast menu could use  or  lighter options which is how i ended up having delicious warm toasted banana bread with tdf espressobutter and coffee icecream because that is not heavy or rich at all for breaky if you are into the pourover definitely check out this place they take it very seriously singapore singaporefood sgfood cshh cakes burple,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,i love this place i was told by a local to come here and i was not disappointed this is coffee roasting at its finest complete with a coffee bar to enjoy your favorite brew and some delicious homemade snacks as well i had a flat white perfectly blended with some curry puffs both were delicious and the price is on par with other coffee shops in singapore except this one was top notch do not expect a place like this to ever be empty if you want a seat you will be waiting and or jumping in front of someone to take it but the ambiance is cool the music was nice and it was a great place to hangout i ended up buying some beans here from their own blend again the prices being very reasonable   sgd a bag against the usa and other singapore coffee shops i must say the area throws you off a bit it appears to be in a residential area with hardware stores around but the area is for sure in the process of changing do not expect free wifi as in many places in singapore since they do not want people camping out here for the day however clean toilets and free water abound,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,tucked away in the most unlikely place in singapore chye seng huat hardware does not sound or look like it would be a hip hangout place from the outside once you step inside though you are greeted with a nice little cafe with cozy decor and chill music yep a speakeasy ish coffeehouse who would have thought we arrived  minutes after noon and the place was packed we could not get a seat inside which is very limited and had to settle for an outside seat it was not ideal after walking in the sweltering sun but after sipping on the cold brew it was quite comfortable if you come here around pm be prepared to wait for a seat some people were definitely eyeing our table as we were finishing our brunch cold brew coffee  i would really like to try their hot coffee but for reasons stated above i would be absolutely crazy not to go for the cold brew i am not a coffee connoisseur by any means but this was really good quality coffee i loved that it came in a cute medicine bottle and deconstructed form so you can mix it up to your desired sweetness scrambled eggs  it is a small portion for me but i am a big eater price is very reasonable in relative to other brunchy places cafe in singapore raspberry financier my friend got this to share i have no idea how to pronounce the name of this cake but it was good and not overly sweetred velvet muffin   this is such a disappointment the cream was half frozen and the cake was really dry i would never waste money on this again,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,i almost did not want to go inside when i saw the place from that outside but i am glad i did they brew a well balanced slightly fruity light roast espresso just how i like them pleasant ambiance but the music is a bit too overpowering,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,after walking up a narrow stair case that gave the impression of hidden wonders i was greeted into a small room that appeared to be something out of alice in wonderland the room was very small and in every way taken over by coffee machines of all sorts and sizes so finding space to sit was a little tough turns out they are renovating the downstairs cafe so this is more of a pop up store in the meantime if you do not mind sitting amongst the makers of natures nectar coffee machines which i did not it was actually a very nice experience to sit and collect my thoughts there was not a good selection of food but understandable as they currently do not have a kitchen i would love to come back in feb once they have finished the renovations and see what treats are in store in the meantime it is a great place if you feel like having a coffee and collecting your thoughts amongst coffee machines,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,it is ok hip place interesting decor love the space but the buts are below latte i have had better ones i like my coffee robust and rich this one is quite there yet after hearing all the hype i have to say i am a tad disappointed coffee ale interesting it reminds me of a light stout but not something i would crave banana cake probably the best thing here for me moist and banana y good to go if i am in the neighborhood but not enough to make it a destination it is so popular these days that it is virtually impossible to get a spot indoors if you come in a group more than  or  you probably have to sit out in the yard not exactly fun if the weather is hot like these couple of weeks,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,i am always a bit hesitant when i read marcus l is reviews i find him to be a very optimistic man but i can certainly say now that he knows his coffee and folks chye seng huat hardware knows their coffee they know know know if you know know what i mean my gf and i stopped by after brunch and tried their signature blend treva link i believe it was fantastic to the very last drop i generally do not finish my coffee at artisan places but my pretty coffee cup was licked dry the tables and bars are kind of small so i do not recommend ordering a proper meal there was barely enough space to hold our two small espressos cups so i cannot imagine two full plates on top of that this place is definitely more of a coffee haven to chit chat so no book worms please the crowd does seem to be the hipster type a trend i seeing bursting along jalan basar and tiong bahru but hey who does not love the brooklyn filmore or art district kind of vibe if you miss the art sy popular coffee shops found in new york san francisco or l a definitely stop by this place,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,quality coffee with reasonable price coffee bean is good and ratio of milk to coffee is awesome will recommend,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,absolutely delightful find loved the space vibe service and coffee options we came here on easter sunday with recommendations to try the cold brew i know i am not normally a fan so opted for the regular brew of the day and was very pleased with my very affordable choice after finishing my coffee i spent time wandering the cafe looking at the different coffee makers and observing the barristas making their creations my only regret was not trying some of the food which looked great and coming too early to browse the upstairs shop,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,ok as far as the roast quality and barista ship goes i am a fan of papa palheta i think the coffee here is probably the best in singapore that is where it ends for chye seng huat however i get that it is trendy cool with the pseudo industrial layout and the name that harks back to singapore is roots i am down with all that but the place on weekends is a madhouse no table service means long queues to order coffee i have sometimes had to wait  minutes in queue just to get an order in hell if they were serving  kopitiam stuff i would probably be fine with that but considering the prices here a bit of table service would not be too much to ask but if people are willing to queue then table service would probably be bad business similarly i assume comfortable seating with ample space would be bad business why give people space comfort when you can pack them in contort them like sardines turn those covers good business papa good business related side note i once saw two rather portly gentlemen and one very large lady try to squeeze themselves onto their bar stools it was uncomfortable to watch i actually had to look away i am also not a huge fan of the food which is  misses with very few hits i frequent this joint reasonably often as it is near where i live on my last visit i ordered a benedict the eggs were overcooked and the ham my god the ham it was that radioactive pink colour i am not even sure that it was technically ham well maybe technically but it sure did not taste like it so what is a four star rating doing accompanying a review that sounds this bad the coffee is that good guys,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,drum rolls cshh is the flagship store of papa palheta if you like ppp you will definitely love this place featuring a coffee bar coffee retail the roastery the workshop and the annex the roastery and coffee bar is exactly what it means the annex is where the tasting happens call and reserve in advance  bucks and the coffee retail is where they display the coffee gadgets and add ons some of which are really interesting jalan besar is definitely not the easiest place to get to but i went there twice without driving so its not impossible lol do not be fooled by the front of the store it may look closed due to the shutter grills but the main entrance is actually on the side just like how ppp is entrance was behind pretty cool concept and it definitely fits well into the entire row of shophouses in the area check out the menu too its really simple espresso milk espresso water and brewed coffee no coffee jargon involved with a really interesting drink that i did not get a chance to try the beer coffee moment where the description was something like jungle beer x papa palheta if i am not wrong maybe someone who has tried that can let me know if its awesome psmooth creamy with no residual bitterness coffee junkies u know where to head to for your next caffeine fix,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,i never figured it out was it a hardware store or was it built up as such quite honestly it does not matter the coffee here iced or hot is some of the best i had in singapore but it is a bit far to get to,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,if you are looking for a bougie cafe and do not mind paying an arm and a leg this place for you if you are looking for coffee and a bite to eat like i was keep looking i am staying in little india about  minute walk from cshh let me start by saying there are barely any places to get coffee in the vicinity of my hotel so my gf and i walked a few blocks to f coffeehouse which was closed due to renovation a guy who worked there recommended cshh after i asked him if there was anywhere else to get coffee in the area although the menu prices were shocking by the time we finally got to cshh we were too hungry and in need of coffee to find yet another place to have breakfast needless to say it cost  for two of us to have a mediocre breakfast in a super busy cafe with no wifi it is also confusingly half order and get your own stuff and half waitress run i was instructed to get my own napkins across the restaurant when i asked the waitress who delivered our food latte was ok not at all worth  lemonade was seltzer water with a squeeze of lemon and food was good but way over priced  for eggs ham sausage and toast are you kidding me this place deserves way more s than yelp gives it,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,good coffee i mean really good coffee is actually harder to find in singapore than you would think given the plethora of coffee shops opening here chye seng huat is blend is not only good on most days it can be one of the best in singapore we have been tag teaming this establishment and toby is estate over in robertson quay for sometime and we think chye seng huat may be starting to edge out the quay is competition including kith having said that the reason why they lost out those extra points to score well in my books  their food is just a ok i think the best dish i have had in there is their steak sandwich cakes lift their game a little  floor service is really good for a coffee shop so the fact that they have so many service staff on the floor puzzled me as to why the staff cannot take orders you must go queue at the cashier and order there make sense not to me they have a strength but are not entirely using it effectively  cashier service as it has become a customer front and interface is actually not that good despite the good floor service as chye seng huat has pushed the customer experience to us queuing at the cashier i have to say that the cashier has on a number of occasions not controlled the queue properly by allowing selfish customers who stand right in front of the cashier waiting for their takeaway coffee and hindering attempts from customers behind wanting to place their order so they can sit down again  chye seng huat opens at am its stated very clearly yet on one morning management apparently decided to hold a staff meeting at am that did not finish until  am not only that they decided not to offer customers standing outside waiting to come in to sit down so while the place definitely serves good coffee we feel that management needs to pick up some common sense and optimise and improve quality of customer service and its hot food menu has potential but is not recognising and or addressing the gaps i feel their overall rating is a little inflated because i have read reviews here where they point out similar flaws i have found and still rate it as  stars c mon people stop promoting poor service in singapore please,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,you know i would really love to like chye seng huat i do not hate it but i do not love it either actually i am just bitter that they got rid of their original french toast the brioche one with loads of banana slices and swimming in maple syrup add a bit of powder sugar almond slices and we were golden maybe i came back too late for a second helping because last time i went it was no more i did not get what i came for and instead got a really sad looking plate of what they wanted to pass off as french toast bring it back cshh then maybe we can be friends again,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,chye seng huat hardware top  cuppa in singaporechye seng huat hardware cshh is the second outpost of papa palheta which located in the new headquarters for papa palheta instead of going the boutique way such as in bukit timah establishment cshh is a full fledge caf serving coffee coffee flavoured beer food and desserts at the back of the caf you can see their workshop roasting machines beside the workshop is the annex this is where you can buy coffee beans and other coffee apparatus the coffee school and gift shop can be located on the second floor this time around i decided to pop by for a quick shot of caffeine and a quick bite before my next appointment in novena the coffee here can be considered as one of the best roasted coffee beans in singapore just check with the crowds flocking this place every day with the third wave coffee movement hitting its stride in singapore you can be sure that you will get a good cuppa just by judging the rosetta latte art in your coffee if it does not have one or the rosetta does not look good you better lower your expectations most of the time cshh will be using their own blend of coffee bean which is known as terra firma for their milk base coffee such as cappuccino latte other variety their coffee is smooth dark with a slight chocolate flavour at the end the best part is that you will not need to add sugar into it for food this is the first time around i have a grub here ordered the blt sandwich and it does not disappoint the bacon and bread is nice and crispy the tomato and lettuce inside the sandwich is fresh they serve the sandwich with chips and mesclun salad with italian dressing overall the quality of the coffee here is excellent the top  best coffee in singapore in my opinion do not forget to check out the annex for coffee beans and coffee apparatus cheers food drink   coffee    value   service   ambiance    if you want to check out the complete review with pictures please click on my food blog the link is on my profile page,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,adding on to the indie cafe scene chye seng huat by papa palheta does a coffee education true to its roots as a coffee roastery and father of third movement in singapore they kept the exterior of the hardware store and also elements of steel bars and grills are incorporated into the interior the food is surprisingly fantastic despite the rather limited menu each item is carefully crafted the platter saw a fresh mix of pork rillette duck terrain salami and parma ham the smoked salmon sandwich was also delightful save some space for their desserts the hazelnut ginger tea cake was a great end to a fantastic meal,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,you would probably dismiss chye seng huat hardware because of its rather nondescript traditional looking exterior go through the gate and you will find a very cool and newly opened little coffee joint hidden inside we popped by cshh i have so much problem trying to remember the name for lunch and the food there is so so nothing particularly outstanding and must have it is a coffee joint after all so food is not quite the key thing here and it shows the omelette was a tad small the beef patty is a little lacking in taste for me though presented beautifully with  different condiments but the salami sandwich was ok the really unusual thing they have here is coffee ale a special collaboration of papa pahelta beans with local brewery jungle beer owner leon who was in store that day took time out to explain the brewing process quite thoroughly this is a guy who knows his beans and beer it was a really unusual brew with a pleasant not overwhelming coffee smell and aftertaste yet still refreshing as a cold beer is the staff here are friendly and amiable the environment is cozy and organic definitely an upcoming hipster hang out and a nice place to chill out hopefully it does not get too crowded besides the main area there are also smaller areas behind an annex workshop and roastery as well as an empty courtyard which i assume is where the crowd might spill over to in future,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,been here twice and i love the place the coffee is good no ice lattes though and there is a wide selection of pastries and cakes to go along with it so far i have found myself sitting outside which is the smoking corner most of the people tend to sit inside so the smoking area is always available a good place to sit down and have coffee when you are bored,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,it is name is very misleading the shopfront if you even call it that depicts that of a hardware company very convincingly housed in a standalone shop house on tyrwhitt road this new coffee bar is an interesting mix of the old and the new while it is exterior retains the traditional look of a usual shophouse complete with chinese characters on its walls and metal bars at its windows the interior is an interesting spin on the modern day cafe and bar i had their pistachio cranberry cake as well as their raspberry fingers for  for  slices of their cakes it is one of the most value for money ones around it was pretty nice too albeit being a tad bit too sweet i had a regular flat white as well as a cold brew while the flat white did not impress the cold brew had an interesting acidic and slightly fruity undertone it was a nice refreshing drink that is great to have on a hot day they also have the annex which is reserved for exclusive tasting sessions involving coffee and light bites at  per pax,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,cshh is the new flagship venue of the papa palheta group located on tyrwhitt road beside jalan besar stadium cshh is a roastery retail space and coffee academy the steeping room previously a pop up space at bras basah makes a welcome return in the form of the annexe a dedicated area for coffee and food pairing papa palheta cafes tend to have a very distinct decor feel and atmosphere cshh is no exception the original shell of the hardware store is intact with art deco lettering and exposed light fixtures enhancing the effect the interior is bright airy and contemporary a new lease of life for one of the old workshops that was here before combined with a large retail space this is not unlike barista jam in sheung wan hong kong a venue i like a lot as always i started by ordering an espresso the blend used was a combination of brazilian coromandel guatamelan antigua and ethiopian sidamo in general brazilian and guatamelean coffees have hints of chocolate and low acidity while ethiopian sidamo has a smooth aftertaste the shot had an intense aroma with a dark brown crema indicitave of freshly roasted beans there was a syrupy mouthfeel that i typically notice in shots from third wave outlets this is an indicator that the shot has been extracted for the correct amount of time the intensity and robust body of the shot was evident from the first tasting the combination of dark chocolate paired with a citrus floral notes gives rise to a complex long lasting bouquet with perfect balance the aftertaste lingers and i could taste it long after i had finished my shot some things are simply better in their places of origin like eating chicken rice in singapore or drinking guinness in dublin drinking a papa palheta blend in cshh was a coffee experience to savour there were more notes flavour and mouthfeel in the last few drops than in any number of shots from other cafes i ordered a cappuccino also it arrived with beautiful latte art and dark brown foam a nice contrast of light and darkness there was a lovely foamy light texture with an intense coffee hit a few seconds later the espresso did not dominate in this drink even though it was a strong shot the milk and espresso work in conjunction a   punch straight to the pallete where one hits right after the other they accentuate each other rather than fight for dominance on your taste buds the layer of foam on top was the correct thickness also a simple thing but not something that every cafe gets right the retail space is large and well stocked with chemex woodneck products hario buono kettles paired with v pourover rigs aeropress and syphons all on display there were  bean varities available also which can be bought whole or ground on request professional espresso machines and grinders are available this is significant the staff are are baristas who use machines such as these each day rather than sales people who may receive commission for recommending a particular type some other notable points are the menu which has a wide variety of brewing types and clever pairings of food to coffee also i like the pairing of jungle beer brewed in admiralty and papa palheta coffee this is entirely consistent with the creative approach of papa palheta i have not yet tried the annexe where food coffee and alcohol pairings are explored more fully but based on the work that has been done in cshh to date and from one or two experiments that are being prepared at present this is something to look forward to in short it is some of the best coffee that i have had the original papa palheta at hooper road may be no more but the same intense robust and complex shots live on in a quiet street at jalan besar,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,disclaimer time i have to admit my review is a little biased i used to work with these guys and i am ever so proud of what they have done chye seng huat hardware or cshh or ah huat if you will is really the evolution of the papa palheta coffee journey which began just over three years ago three years and two days as of this review this place is in a word cool you can come here for three things  a coffee beans are roasted by the team in their other locations but operations will be centralised to the workshop in the adjacent building in the near future your beverage is made before you in the island bar and you can see the baristas in action no matter if it is an espresso based coffee or one of the many other filter brews  on quieter days a conversation talk to the baristas the island bar is built for interaction and ask them why the do things a particular way like why your filter coffee has water poured in a particular fashion and the importance of the right temperature  a taste experience if you are a little more keen call ahead to book a session at the annex you can geek out with a few of your friends over the intricacies of flavour in each small batch roasted origin and even get some off the menu treats as flavour pairings if you are mega geeking it out there is number  an education they do barista training upstairs as well so if you have wanted to get behind the coffee counter here is where you can start as a barista i cannot think of many other places i would want to be work at and if you are as much of a coffee geek as me you will feel the same way,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,the good fantastic space very friendly staff smiles and was asked if my coffee was good considering it was packed the crumble cake was decent and the coffee i drank was surprisingly tasty i am not a huge coffee fan but when i do it is full of sugar this one bright brew i drank straight up and loved it cudos the bad selection lacks from food to drink options i struggled to find anything i really wanted to order mentally i was prepared for breakfast which they did not have another huge bummer no soy it is asia almost  could be way off but it is high of people are lactose intolerant need a non dairy option stat another thing was the music i was only there for  minutes and heard the same song twice saw a record player playing spinning but it seems it is there for show and not to actually play music if i am wrong mix up the records if i am not plug it in and let people play the records they want to hear turntables are not meant to be props the ugly could not fit my finger in the cup handle how am i suppose to drink almost dropped it a few times while sipping which would have been extra embarrassing since it seemed everyone there is there to stare at each other,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,a nice idea and pleasant enough place but with the ordering process it builds up the anticipation for some great coffee have to say i was greatly underwhelmed i was gonna give a generous three stars but myfellow yelper li ting says it is two stars tops forgettable,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,if you are not a coffee fan like me and cannot tell the difference between a kopi o at the local hawker center and the new starbucks asian dolce latte i swear by god they taste the same then do not come here because you will not be able to appreciate the coffee tried the latte and house brew but could not tell the difference between this coffee and others i think the food here is decent tried the pancakes and french toast but there are better places for food if you are really hungry i can imagine this being a nice chill out place but when i reached on saturday afternoon is was just super crowded and packed to the brim managed to get seats but i found them squeezy and it was hard to get past the long line of people at the counter the one thing i liked was the lemonade though tastes exactly like a virgin mojito yum,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,sigh their coffee sucks we ordered cappuccino an espresso and drip filter cap and espresso were bad i guess the machine was way too hot during the pour filter was meh this place has a roaring business its a hip place its style over substance what they serve is at best passable i wish liberty up the road was open more frequently that is a good spot for coffee,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,meh cute location and nice ambiance but i was not super impressed with the espresso steep prices and pray that you are lucky enough for on street parking,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,love the surroundings and set up that is really unique and indie the coffee blend borders slightly acidic but still acceptable for me it is strong and robust cakes are average good if you need a bite did not try the savoury food but they look good,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,the location tucked away in jalan besar with a nondescript entrance and concept nostalgic exterior makes cshh a go to place for people looking for something more than just a cup of coffee however the lacklustre mains really let this place down the food tasted and looked like cold fast food i had pancakes with sour cream and smoked salmon topped with beansprouts it looked and tasted like it was hastily put together the chicken wrap and banana cake were better and more enjoyable having said that the coffee is like what the other reviewers have said quite good and i would pop by here for a cup if i am ever in the area but i would hesitate to recommend it to people who want to come all the way down to have a meal,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,menu has limited coffees to choose from but the coffees are good the hand brewed coffee was flavorful and they change the type of coffee beans used often,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,there is everything that you need here it is no longer as cheap as it used to be but you will be able to find some hidden gems if you try hard enough go go,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,surprisingly quiet for a saturday night i wonder if it was the rain that deterred the crowd from coming out this place is pretty unique and i like it even though i am not a coffee drinker i ordered the homemade lemonade and it was tangy and yummy not too sour not too sweet one thing i did note was the air conditioner was really powerful on the inside too cold for my liking so i opted to sit outside despite the strong smell of incense coming from a nearby temple the staff were friendly too and it has a laid back atmosphere i definitely want to go back again the mains and dessert looked pretty attractive,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,it was good acceptable the cake was too dry though and the coffee was rather milky to my liking the long black was good though i love the place it was hidden and the concept was unique atmosphere was very good,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,situated in an old building the decor of the restaurant is quite unique and although named like a hardware stall it sells anything but hardware the menu has a whole lot of variety from pancakes sandwiches pastries to coffee and french toast i really like their french toast and the maple syrup that they serve with it a real valued for money dish their banana cake was really good too as i love the moist texture that it had and the little bits of banana that i could taste inside too service was really good too and i would definitely go back for more food and coffee and of course the unique looking stall too,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,the young girl with short hair here seems very inpatient i asked what is in the dessert she said it is all written on it already look at me like i do not know how to read very nice,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,from the same people who brought you loysel is toy and papa pahelta we now have another coffee experience brought to our shores featuring an island bar counter for you to watch the baristas at work this joint promises a lot to come in terms of enjoying coffee i am still reeling in all the information that aside i dropped by early today for breakfast had the cold brew which was served in a medicine bottle like jar very symbolic for how potent it is i like it watered down slightly by the ice also had their breakfast in a cup which was a mix of tomatoes herbs and eggs baked in a ramekin interesting concept which can do with more shaking up i like how they continue to surprise this one is one to watch,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,chye seng huat is a welcome addition to the cafe scene in my opinon with the recent cafe craze and mass genesis of indie third wave cafes cshh really is a standout for a number of reasons the space is really interesting it looks like like a hardware store shophouse that is not in use from the front but if you walk in through the metal gate next to the shophouse shutter doors then you are greeted with a hive of activity and a large courtyard area the most interesting feature for me is the roastery cshh is owned by the people behind loysel is toy and papa pahleta is and i hear the coffee beans used at all three establishments are roasted at cshh the cafe area also has a unique layout configuration with a bar style coffee making area in the centre of the room there are seats around the bar the coffee itself is also really good i like the new cold brew though my latte was a little flat when i visited,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,the latest hipster cafe is worth visiting the general vibe is similar to that of papa palehtta the coffee ethiopian cold brew was decent i really like the furnishing and deco of this place which was rather antiquated and the  degree coffee bar is the first in singapore which gives the customers a full view of the baristas making the coffee they also have an annex a place where they hold coffee tasting sessions,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,the latest coffee joint also happens to be the most underground one disguised as a traditional hardware store on the exterior it reveals a painfully hip interior that is sure to attract all the hipster and wannabe types and the hipster invasion has already begun judging from our first visit there conveniently located near my girlfriend is workplace we stopped by after lunch expecting some peace and quiet before she went back to work but we had no such luck well it was not noisy or overcrowded but the overall vibe and feel there was not what we expected that said it wo not deter us from coming back as the coffee on offer here is really good,Negative
chye-seng-huat-hardware,great coffee but the service is so awfully inefficient it drives me mental lots of staff but they seem to require  people to watch while one works in slow motion bring lots of patience when coming here and keep out of peak periods,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,great coffee random name good banana cake very hipster ish and pretty atmosphere love it,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,packed limited selection of food and drinks service was reasonably good enjoyed the ambience no comments on their latte,Positive
chye-seng-huat-hardware,do not dash by this white building with a distinctively chinese name looks can be deceiving rather labels can be too hardware may not be hardware here at cshh they are afterall coffeesmiths hidden inside this enclave what a location wait till you go in a big establishment bringing you the best of coffee land with all processes integrated into one roasting espresso machine workshop coffee school caf and even a tasting room by reservation only are housed in this hardware warehouse coffee is the familiar papa palheta afterall they are the ones who have brought you new concepts year after year think loysel is toy come for the entire experience with more interesting flavour pairing here as compared to loysel is toy,Positive
little-india,little india is great for those of us who are old enough to remember what singapore used to be like this is the last area where you can truly get a glimpse of what singapore used to be the streets of little india are stocked full of all kinds of everything little india has probably the best outdoor food market in all of singapore you can really get some great items to prepare your next meal plus there are tons of shops that offer clothing jewelry and pretty much the everything else of singaporean indian culture also there are a couple of great religious shrines located in little india at night little india truly comes to life it is really a great place to walk among the people see the lights of the shops the lights that are on the streets and truly experience singaporean east indian culture if you do nothing else in singapore you must come to little india,Positive
little-india,little india is so colorful and full of yummy food stalls i like to come here to enjoy colorful buildings and some of the curry my favorite here is fish head curry it is like a trip to india without actually flying there price of the goods are okay perhaps what i saw was per negotiation price i was tempted to buy a tradition indian dress as they looked nice i did not get one as i was still traveling and when i think through it where can i really wear them anyway dress was that pretty it made me consider purchasing one on this particular time a stranger bought me a lily flower to put on my hair another person came up to me after i put flower on my fair that i was doing it wrong and fixed it for me flower smelled so good i put flower by my bed after i got back to my hotel and it smells good all night long,Positive
little-india,a must go for those who want to explore a little bit more a different kind of town i made it here by train and i walked around as i enjoyed the many foods flowers and all types of vendors you can find in here from vegetables to fruits flowers accessories clothes and so much more the color and smells were the highlights of the afternoon as i expected they also have a huge food court inside a place next to the train station with soooo many places to choose from it was a shame that i had breakfast before i went because i was full and i could not try anything but the smell of the food was so good that i end up taking some sweets back to the hotel with me,Positive
little-india,living in the us there are not many cities that have indian neighborhoods especially not miami my home or tucson current residence so being in singapore and walking around in this neighborhood brought back some good old memories from back in the day when i was still in pakistan it is a street of several blocks full of indian markets including clothes random accessories delicious food stalls and restaurants to name a few things there is a mall type building that had some great food stalls where we got some bomb biryani and samosas and then after walking around for a while had to control myself from shopping ate dinner at bbq tonite that as mentioned in another review was delicious if i were to live in singapore this would be a regular street for me to visit for some good food and shopping,Positive
little-india,pretty cool neighbourhood with a ton of shops lots of gold perfume and other knick knacks i came across an outdoor food centre as well but did not have grab a bite as there is to many good restaurants in singapore and i got way to much food before getting here i did not realize how large the area would be but there is a cool arch at one of the entrances,Negative
little-india,i am all about experiencing everything for myself and discovering thus creating my own unbiased opinion through firsthand experiences i love experiencing different cultures and adventures and emerging myself into how locals live this place was bustling with people and vendors although there were not many things to look at or explore and many of the alleys were a tad dirty many travel books and online search suggest this area as a must but i would have been ok if we skipped it,Negative
little-india,wow first stop of our singapore trip and this places is so indian and asian getting food was a bit of a struggle but we found a big market with meat and fish as well as food stalls meals start at  sgd a set the entire area feels a bit dirty but overall it is an interesting place to go to especially if you are nearby,Positive
little-india,lots of indian shops with lots of heritage they sell lots of interesting items and food that are related to the indian culture it was very enlightening for me to check out little india,Negative
little-india,there are so many things to see in little india even just walking the streets so many things to watch and observe i have been to chinatown japanese town little tokyo koreatown little italy little saigon etc but seeing little india for the first time just amazing their colorful decoration in the entrance caught my attention also two huge colorful elephants are something you do not want to miss the streets are filled with gold retail stores i never knew india people are into gold not only jewelry stores restaurants gift shops fruit vegetables store unique colorful buildings are just amazing only thing i did not like was too many people homeless in the park they did not look like ordinary people since hairs was all messy dirty clothes sitting and laying down on ground freely as i walk near everyone was starring at me and little scary i see no harm in them but just felt uncomfortable spending  hrs in little india allow me to understand little more about their lifestyle and culture,Positive
little-india,i love exploring ethnic enclaves in cities across the globe i think it just gives me a better perspective on how immigrants establish themselves in other countries now singapore is of course a melting pot of cultures so a visit to little india should definitely be a stop on your tour around the city there are many restaurants and shops throughout the tight neighborhood but i feel that to truly get a sense of the culture you must eat where the locals eat i try to stay away from other tourists so i delve deep into little india to see what it is all about i found so many shops selling anything and everything which really did not help my wallet but aside from the shopping just experiencing this enclave in singapore made me feel as if i was actually in india the hop on hop off tour buses stop by this place and i believe you should as well,Positive
little-india,nice place to visit when you are in singapore there is a food area a market where you can find fresh seafood fruits vegetables etc in the upper section they have lots of clothing and even tailors it was wonderful to see some ladies in their traditional sarees,Positive
little-india,i understand it is a cultural thing but give people space to look be aware of this if you have space issues not all of the places where so intrusive of personal space but some of the men need to check there hormones and leave the girls alone it just creepy when they are standing so close they are touching you,Negative
little-india,fantastic place to see all ethnic groups eating in one place albeit sectioned off muslim halal no pork eat with your right hand fingers hindu no cows chinese singaporean eat anything there is always a place to wash your hands so do not be afraid to eat with your fingers like the locals it took a couple of days to get the curry chili tattoo off my fingers,Negative
little-india,my only regret is forgetting to buy the lovely indian saree here september  not only are the prices great more affordable than saree shops in california united states where i live they look fabulous on any lady regardless of your culture saree is truly for every elegant woman who wants a piece of india is rich cultural as well as any who genuinely appreciate india is ancient history i was invited by a generous shop owner during the months of deepawali to check out their fabulous collection and my oh my i was astonished and feeling humbled that such amazing artistry existed beyond my wildest dreams haha having studied indian cultural history i had always admired the jewelry and clothing pieces from the indian part of the continent they are such fine artisans and creative people next i toured among the hawker centers that offer rich indian fare and decliously tender and mesmerizing naan bread prepared punjabi style northern indian oh gawd the buttery taste of the lovely bread gently peppered with spices and little seeds when dipped into home made curry was fabulous i only hoped that the young chef would wipe his hands first before handling money and food at the safe time i saw that and would like this young chap to kindly improve in this area please do yourself and customers a favour there was a very kind older tamil gentleman who asked me to try their spicy halal lamb with rice my goodness it was fabulously delicious and a very pleasant surprise everybody makes their biryani rice differently including the persians the afghanis but this muslim chef makes it so very blended with just the right shade of tasty spicy a big thank you arabic shukraan to the hardworking chefs who made this trip to singapore a meal to remember there was plenty of hand made items on sale this months september  to october i was having a great time taking photos chatting with friendly locals and because of my accent was mistaken as australian by some australians actually mine was a blended scottish accent since i speak hebrew arabic japanese some german lots of aussies shopping here and i chatted with them and their kids too so cute overall it was an art galore with lots to see and lots of memories to make since everywhere you go in little indian amazing works of art and jewelries pops into the eye there was a small vegetarian restaurant that sell fabulous indians style candies which i loved and bought several pieces to try and great heavens they were even more delicious than they looked not too sweet like american confectionary which can kill you and cause diabetes so prevalent in california what a shame one must not forget the museum right in the heart of little india where tourists pay  to venture into foreign tourists such as myself although i had grown up in sinagpore when very little it was an amazingly rich experience after my tantalizing food tour one must see it for oneself to know and learn what india south east asian culture truly is i will be back in  definitely coming back i missed singapore and the great dishes i had while here,Positive
little-india,lots of things to see i came on a saturday and it is was crowded some vendors will not let you take photos they will pressure you to buy they ask you things like what is your price range and will only show you certain things they can be rude if you decide not to buy they stares at you and will not give you room to shop would not be one of the things on my list to visit,Negative
little-india,little india was on my friend is check list so we boarded the mrt to ne little india station walked around on street level to the next mrt farrer park station ne to exit the neighborhood it was a sunday afternoon so it seemed as if everyone was off work and hanging out on the streets i saw more men then women not sure why the smell of incense curry and bo in the heat was thick and difficult to bear no one picked on us none of us got robbed it seemed safe but just not comfortable we were not used to such crowded conditions we saw many people going in and coming out of mustafa centre so we went in to see what was inside it is a huge shopping center reminded me of walmart except larger much much larger i bought some local fruits guava mangosteen banana starfruit and longan one person in our group got lost in the buildings and panicked,Negative
little-india,nice area a sizable section catering to the many indians who live in singapore a rather old area that have been preserved naturally lots of indian restaurants and stores,Positive
little-india,well as the name implies this is a little bit of india located near the heart of singapore it it pretty easy to get to all you need to do is get off at the little india mrt station at bang you are there i simply wandering through the area just taking in the sights and sounds of all the stores and marvelling at the produce and textiles available especially the clothes that i have always admired the indians really know how to make a decent dress not like the ones you see in the chain stores in the shopping centres as for food there certainly is a lot of offerings around here though i was not able to find a place that sold a decent vindaloo namely because i was not looking hard enough or simply looking in the wrong places this place is certainly worth visiting while in singapore though you may need to spend a little more time here than i did,Positive
little-india,east of singapore river lies an ethnic neighborhood that has indian tamil cultural elements and aspects influenced by other cultures how does one visit singapore and not stroll to little india hindu temples and colorful sari is with the aromatic stench of curry in all shape and form fills the air for hoards of street peddlers are ready to bargain ladies await for visitors ready to paint henna among the uniquely ethnic tamil of indian culture this is how i remember little india from my singapore visit in  this is little india in singapore,Positive
little-india,very dirty place in singapore i was wondering how the government allows this place to be so dirty i loved seeing indian people in singapore there lots n lot of daily wage people i tried few restaurant and food carts the cost is cheaper compared to us dollars taste was ok,Negative
little-india,i fucking love this place let me say it again i fucking love this place whenever i travel i make it a point to visit places that are alive with culture and since singapore is more commercial centers are not really my thing little india was right up my alley not kidding my hostel was truly located up an alley p given my location i always woke up to amazing sights and sounds and amazing meals i loved getting lost among the temples the bustling mustafa centre and ducking into random restaurants that served delicious southern indian cuisine i made a point to go where all the clientele were mostly laborers that is how you know it is good and accidentally discovering beautiful little bazaars with indian handicrafts jewelry and more i love how the entire place smelled like tiger balm and nag champa i would dedicate another trip to sg just to explore this place,Positive
little-india,super cool area that you must check out if you are visiting singapore try to stop by at night too while all the decorations are up it is absolutely gorgeous shopping from indian dresses to bangles you can get anything here and if that is not your style well mustafas is a close walk by and there you can definitely get anything you will ever need think of it as the walmart of singapore food so many great indian places to eat around here definitely would recommend komala villa is though to get here just get off at the little india mrt station and you are pretty much there you can walk down the entire street and check out all the stores,Positive
little-india,i thought there would be more to this part of town either that or i completely missed it lol although i loved the beautiful hindu temple,Negative
little-india,want to go to india without leaving singapore you have met your match as it is no coincidence that this area of singapore is called little india there are tons of stores everywhere including my personal favorite set of hawker stalls in singapore the hawker stalls are in a three store building which is in the middle of little india you can find produce and meat on the first and second level and clothing on the third with tons of saris staff willing to haggle and tailors that are ready to assist you around this main building you can find electronics clothing stores restaurants and more the sri veeramakaliamman temple is also a popular stop for locals and tourists,Positive
little-india,this is a true bonsa version of india here in singapore you will get a taste of the food the people the hustle bustle that is india many good food options are available along the strip some are quite authentic and worth the trip getting a taxi can be a pain tho and this is the only place in singapore that i have seen people litter on the streets,Positive
little-india,a cultural hub full of sights and smells to tantalize the senses an absolute must do when coming to singapore this may be one of the few sights that is not westernized in singapore the whole area stands out with its own character and charm keep your eyes peeled for the large hawker food stall building clothes are on the nd floor food is on the st floor there is also fresh produce and fish in the back word of the wise bring your own tissues napkins if eating with your hands is your thing and grab a n iced white coffee for a huge morning wake up if only every day began with condensed milk i would be a happier girl,Positive
little-india,if you go through exit a of little india mrt your journey towards a colourful culture begins this stretch of indian culture is one of many spots to visit during your vacation here in singapore no wonder accommodations in this area are always booked little india did not disappoint at all from their gold jewelries colourful saris and mounds of spices it feels like i was transported to india minus the cows walking around freely this is also a good place to get bargains on their products the good thing about it is that they speak really good english so there is not any chance of being lost in translation if you are aiming to enjoy authentic indian food be on a look out for indian restaurants they are everywhere this is a great place for a group of friends to gather and explore a chunk of indian culture more like an overview for great things to come maybe a visit to india itself,Positive
little-india,little india is great there are tons of indian things and indian people and indian food and indian hindi temples and stuff i felt like i was in india though i have never actually been to mumbai delhi or the like what is my favorite parts food temples and people,Positive
little-india,one of top  places to visit next time i am in singapore esp if you adore indian food as much as here actually did not try yet as too many deleesh food in this hawker centre as well sg just literally scattered w tons of these food delights but this place is full of action even past midnight even the mall there is open late even  hrs even a full shopping centre with multiple exits clearly labelled sg sure know their stuff almost like a hk mtr exit format lol safe too,Negative
little-india,my mom told us we are going to india and confusedly i jumped on the bus to follow her from nus to chinatown to another bus from clark quay all the way to little india and lo and behold it was just like walking out of a magic portal into india the foods the spices the smells the people everything screamed india and no longer singapore sari stores and bangles line the streets with women with their arms painted in intricate henna and mendhi if you want a good indian food dinner here is your stretch of street pick any of them and get a great dinner of butter chicken tikka masala paneer and naan do not forget the mango lassi there is an mrt entrance and busses but beware that taxis do not come all the way over here as often as they are around other places in singapore we had to ask our restaurant to call a cab for us which they very obligingly did a great visit for a meal and to explore one of the most interesting ethnic enclaves in asia that i have seen yet,Positive
little-india,want to go to india without leaving singapore similar to lil italy in nyc singapore has lil india lil india is not little at all it goes down the street for blocks upon blocks you will see the marketplace people selling fruits and meats and my friend got henna while we were down here it is definitely an interesting spot to visit,Positive
little-india,i stayed here for a week and had fun careful the only people that ripped me off in singapore were indian people at open air markets be careful when you buy something in little india the scent of incense burning and curry fill the air after a couple of days that same lovely smell starts to be displeasing the people were friendly i did run into more than a couple people indians that were rude i was not the only person that had this negative experience i highly recommend you visit this neighborhood i would visit this beautiful neighborhood again the food is great at the hawkers in little india check out prata saga sambal berlada they have some great pratas mmmm yummy the same courtyard has sugar cane water a must try well hope you have fun here if you decide to visit,Positive
little-india,love it here fabulous food many similarities to being in india colors street life food shopping all an assault on the eyes just fabulous really love this part of town,Positive
little-india,interesting neighborhood to check out while visiting singapore lots of different stores selling gold jewelry clothing veggies fruits etc many restaurants to try and vegetarian options located right by mrt train station,Positive
little-india,little india where westerners rave and the locals steer away seriously though it was like pulling teeth to get my friend to take me here lucky for me he had to go for a class project and i was able to tag along when you arrive you realize there are only two demographics indians obviously and tourists i think i saw more germans than indians during my lunch excursion there seems to be a disconnect between the western view of indian culture and how the singaporeans view it anyways it is a good afternoon trip if you are running out of things to explore we ate at a really great vegetarian restaurant where two curries and two pastry like puffs were sold at   you can get henna done and buy flower garlands but i ended up just purchasing a kohl eyeliner there are a few cool buildings one a former sweets factory owner is home that has been converted to a business center and a few temples though the largest one was under construction when we visited,Positive
little-india,fascinating indian quarter of singapore we felt like we were visiting another country as shops restaurants and temples combined with the indian singaporeans make this feel like suburban delhi totally authentic and not in the least bit touristy offering a real glimpse into indian life sampled great food at the banana leaf restaurant again totally authentic and thankfully not in the least big tampered to western taste a few cold tiger beers needed another great evening in singapore,Positive
a-noodle-story,if you are a ramen fan and would like to try an alternative version one that has a local twist then you will like this place the dish is a blend of singapore wanton noodle and japanese ramen it comes with slices of japanese style char siew onsen egg and a fried shrimp wrapped in potato while the price tag of s  appear to be high for a food center stall the quality is very good you can also opt to upgrade to the special with a whole egg additional shrimp and a bowl of mushroom with fish maw for s  that is what i did and i enjoyed it thoroughly,Positive
a-noodle-story,this place is known for singaporean ramen very different from japanese stuff but with some similar elements like the soft cooked egg tempura shrimp charshu it comes with a bit of their own sauce and broth on the side ask for it spicy to get some chili sauce on the side the noodle was egg based thin had a good bite to it and you can see an old man making the noodles right in front it is definitely one of the more expensive stalls a small is  dollars  for medium  for large but they do add special attention to detail for example they use the tweezers from fancy restaurants to place the scallions in your bowl and wipe the bowl is edge before serving i had read the owner trained with chef andre before it is definitely unique and worth checking out,Positive
a-noodle-story,singaporean ramen may not be for me but the dishes served up at a noodle story were so fantastically unique that it is worth your time star  how were the service and atmosphere i would heard horror stories about the lines at a noodle story so my friends and i arrived a full half hour or so before they opened on a rainy monday early evening to our surprise the place was empty and a noodle story went ahead and opened early i think because they felt bad for us from there everything was peachy and our three dishes came out quickly star star  how were the portions relative to the cost   for any hawker dish is boku expensive but given the size and complexity of this dish it was not in my mind unreasonable star stars  and  how was the food so i really really love the concept of ramen style noodle dishes with little to no broth and that is more or less exactly what this was with some great peripherals like shrimp wrapped in pan fried noodles and shrimp wontons having said that the entire dish especially the noodles were very fishy which for me is a pretty quick turn off even so good stuff and a dream for people who have different taste preferences from my own single star star  would you be excited to go back if i could taper off the fishiness this would be a dream dish so i would be excited to go back and see if i could get that option star,Negative
a-noodle-story,so here is the thing i love all the toppings from the wontons to the egg to the crispy prawn and the ever soft tender char sui the prawn was my husband is favorite think tempura shrimp but next level the outer crunchy is spiraled and adds this insane texture the noddles themselves were just okay but i think it is just because i prefer super soft ramen but man best toppings ever on a ramen and the presentation is stunning a work of art,Positive
a-noodle-story,michelin bib gourmand noodle stall in amoy street food center nicknamed singapore is ramen the noodle dish is a fun bowl of slightly springy noodle super good texture and rich soup on the side other accompaniments shrimp wonton egg pork slices fried shrimp ball are all tastey though not mindblowingwaited an hour for this was it worth it i guess so i could try it out but would not line up again,Negative
a-noodle-story,a noodle story might be my favorite stall in singapore i heard the wait can be long but i got there at  pm and waited about  mins to order and  mins for the food the noodles egg wonton crispy prawn meat and presentation was prefect you can get it small or large but when i got there they were sold out of the large it was so good that i wish i have ordered two smalls the bf said this should been a michelin star stall fyi they were sold out before closing time cannot wait to come back to singapore and eat this,Positive
a-noodle-story,i was really excited to try this but i think this may have been ranked the lowest out of all the hawker dishes i have tried on my trip it was  sgd pricey and it was alright i am pretty sure i asked for no chili but got chili anyway in my noodles so i ended up not being able to finish it at least the pork belly was nice and tender,Negative
a-noodle-story,they call this a singaporean ramen i do not think that is an actual thing but the ramen is fairly unique and not like a traditional ramen at all the main different is the toppings the soup has wontons in it that are super delicious however the highlight is the single fried potato dumpling holy crap that dumpling is delicious it was so delicious like a super crunch deep fried curly fry,Positive
a-noodle-story,aww yeah i was full already but that did not stop me from stuffing myself with noodles from this place we went here early because we knew there will be a line up but i made a rookie mistake of having juice from a nearby stand after only finishing breakfast about half an hour before late breakfast p but geeze was it worthed going there and feeling like i could explode from eating too much this morning we only realized that the noodles has prawns in it when i started to order and then we found out the broth is seafood based as well luckily can they were nice enough to whip up a simple broth for me even though i am sure it is not as good as the normal broth it was still awesome and the char siu it melts in the mouth every mouth full was loaded with flavor definitely worth the visit,Positive
a-noodle-story,termed the singapore ramen this take on our traditional wanton noodles is a winner in every aspect high quality ingredients prepared well yet at a relatively much lower price point starts from  when compared to similarly quality ramens where else can you find such a rare gem it is no wonder the lines are out the door every single day al dente noodles melt in your mouth pork perfectly marinated ramen style eggs hard whites runny yolks crispy wantons full flavoured umami packed soup only available if you dine at the hawker just take my yes you can definitely find ordinary wanton noodles at more than half that price but you get what you pay for some people complain about the lines and the high price for a hawker dish but if you really consider the premium ingredients and time effort taken to prepare every bowl is  really too much the same argument goes for most other hawker dishes actually why are people willing to pay more for cafe food which often takes way less effort to prepare at perhaps x the price with minimal complaints be prepared to wait at least  mins during lunch time thinking of going later to avoid the queue you may be disappointed sometimes they close early as they run out of ingredients learnt that the hard way so go early when they open before lunch or before dinner to avoid disappointment they have an express queue which comes at a premium of  per bowl well worth it if you are crunched for time but absolutely must try this pro tip if you are in the cbd area noodle story is sometimes delivered on grabfood under their hawker initiative,Positive
a-noodle-story,the queue was long the price was high for a hawker vendor but the food lived up to expectation this is not a ramen shop by any japanese means for ramen broth is half the meal here it is a dry bowl filled with pan fried yumminess be sure to add this place to your singapore experience,Negative
a-noodle-story,despite this hawker stall is a bit out of the way and not as popular a noodle story is definitely worth a visit i came in the early dining hours and there was already a line up and i unfortunately had to wait behind a person that ordered  noodles to go nevertheless the noodle here was nothing like i have had before there are so much ingredients in one order and everything tastes amazing,Negative
a-noodle-story,this was delicious i got a small and it was a perfect amount for one the distinct textures between the dumplings soft boiled eggs noodles and fried prawns were so playful and tasty absolutely recommend,Positive
a-noodle-story,i will never look at ramen the same again singaporean style ramen is how they describe this spot it is located on the bottom floor of the amoy hawker stand i came right when they opened because i knew there would be a long line around lunch time this place is packed with business people on their lunch break they have three sizes and i went with the medium get the chili once you get your bowl mix it all up their cha su is probably the best i have ever had their hk style wontons were beyond amazing their crispy wrapped prawn was nice and crunchy and their egg cooked to perfection i have never anything so good and it is a must stop if you are in singapore,Positive
a-noodle-story,it is worth the wait waits in hawker centers are common for good food most of them seem to be worth it this one is definitely worth it get there before it becomes a bigger thing singapore style ramen has been created and this is it in my top  ramens of all time best of luck to a noodle story actually they really do not need it they are already there,Positive
a-noodle-story,this singaporean take on ramen is special each ingredient the egg beef wonton etc is delicately and carefully prepared and assembled into one delicious bowl queue nowhere near as bad as people here have suggested  minutes at  on a thursday for a by hawker standards pricey  bowl of ramen,Positive
a-noodle-story,price is a little on the higher side but that is only because they use quality ingredients really worth the queue,Positive
a-noodle-story,the noodles definitely achieve the shop is goal of serving gourmet noodles at hawker prices the flavors in the dish are extremely fresh and the broth is very well seasoned  stars just because the service while trying to operate most efficiently in a small space can be a bit awkward as you are prompted to state your order while still halfway down the line at a point when you cannot actually read the menu so it is tough to decide any additions modifications you may want to make to the order other than the size of the portion although the wait is not nearly as bad as other reviews make it out to be once i had located the stall i maybe waited  mins in total between joining the line and receiving my food at  pm peak lunch hour,Positive
a-noodle-story,singaporean style ramen yes please came to the amoy street food centre with a mission to eat at noodle story it is on the first floor and has a really nice sign and exterior and a long line of people waiting for food which is a good sign i waited like   minutes to order there is just one thing the noodles but you can get small medium or large and you can add on extra sides like an extra egg or more hk style wontons the lady behind me said that the larger sizes just come with more noodles after i placed my order for a small bowl the light for the sign went out the lady behind me said that that meant they ran out of stuff i had such good timing the noodles were so delicious no broth noodles were amazing the hard boiled egg was cooked perfectly the potato wrapped shrimp was super tasty and the wontons and chashu pork were yummy a perfect  my noodles also came with a soup totally worth the wait,Positive
a-noodle-story,minute wait we got into the line at   and got our food at  minutes past one if you have that kind of time this place worth the visit we got two small bowls of singaporean style ramen and we both enjoyed it a lot the noodles the broth all the dressings were phenomenal the slow cooked egg was silky and creamy chirashi pork was delish my boyfriend wants to come back here again after the rush hour as you can see the line getting significantly shorter after  pm and they are open till  also since it was hard for me to find the food center i bookmarked gayatri restaurant the place right outside of it so it is easy to find it next time the hawker center is two stories and the noodles are in the ground level  sgd per small bowl of ramen i think it is worth it,Positive
a-noodle-story,i was intrigued when i heard that there is a singapore style ramen my friend who lives there brought me here when i visited last july for me this ramen tasted like your typical wonton noodles with a lot of add ons aside from wontons they added a runny egg potato crisp covered prawn and char siu i like how they thought about making this bowl of noodles in a typical hawker set up overall i would say it is worth a try,Positive
a-noodle-story,visited this shop approximately a month ago came with a high expectation amid the fanfare generated by the michelin announcement and the plethora of cool pictures on instagram ordered the jumbo plate and it was okay many people loved its concept of a singapore style ramen but it was fusion confusion for me personally i found it pretty weird to be eating a wanton chinese dish immediately after a cha shu japanese dish in entirety the taste profiles of the ingredients just did not blend elegantly enough in addition i found the noodles too cluttered in a lump making it tough to eat finally the chilli looked cool but tasted pretty dry nonetheless i was deeply impressed by the quality of the ingredients and that the owners decided not to cut corners despite the price point and hawker food positioning the potato wrapped prawn was also pretty incredible crunchy and tasty and yes the bowl of noodle was full of cool ingredients that would make it very much instagram worthy does it deserve a bib gourmand probably not for me although the owners are still pretty young and will only go up from there i applaud their audacity to sort of reinvent the wheel and i look forward to trying their dish again in a year,Negative
a-noodle-story,my bowl of noodles was meticulously prepared reminiscent of the care that goes into a bowl of japanese ramen it was certainly a step up in ingredient quality from the usual hawker fare i do however agree with other reviewers that the dumplings and chashu lack an umami punch my guess is that they do not use msg but unlike japanese ramen shops do not have enough ingredients that contribute their own umami of course these are small grouses given the very reasonable price of     it is certainly worth a try if you are near amoy,Negative
a-noodle-story,i think that it may be wrong to come to this stall with the intention of tasting typical wanton mee the stall owner describes this as a singaporean style ramen an apt description everything here is done as per ramen standards the soup the pork belly imported from spain and cooked sous vide for  hours to the potato wrapped prawns and hk style wanton careful attention and detailed work the result a damn good bowl of wan ton mee do not expect the fiery chilli like eng is or the one at da jie but come here if you want a take on wanton mee by a new generation of chefs,Negative
a-noodle-story,our last day in town and we got there around pm and they were sold out as we were in line the young owner explained that they ran out of a few toppings we said we did not care and we would be happy if he can give us what he has left the noodle was fine but the chef owner was so kind that the experience was a good one we took pictures with the chef and got our noodle story as the last customer that day,Negative
a-noodle-story,yum yum yum what a great way to take in the people watching experience that is hawker center by diving into this delicious experience i love the take on the ramen this is more my style than the traditional ramen so i can see why authentic ramen lovers may not be as thrilled about this remix as others the ingredients were so good and the experience in general made it one of my favorite places in singapore,Positive
a-noodle-story,fight through the hawker market to find a diamond in the lower class diamonds who are we kidding everything is delicious at these hawker markets but this place wow amazing is ingaporean noodles tiny place to make them and yet perfection each time if you are in singapore for one day this is the place for lunch,Positive
a-noodle-story,it was pretty good but not amazing somehow perhaps i was just missing the typical random stalks of veg that come with normal wanton mee also i prefer normal char siew to the cha shu that they provided here think layers of fat meat i really do not like fat in my meat anyway  noodle bowl does come with a fair bit of stuff yummy potato strip wrapped prawn deep fried and certainly crisp nice texture  slices cha shu  pcs wonton v bouncy w prawn inside fried shallots some seasoning or other which adds some sweetness to the sauce pretty gd sambal too mee is the wonton mee texture probably my favourite type of noodles it does take a while to get your food though oh it also comes with a bowl of soup,Positive
long-bar,the only reason to stop by here is to have a sip of history long bar invented the singapore sling a gin based fruity cocktail that was historically used to make drinking alcoholic beverages by women more acceptable the bar is located in the raffles hotel in a colonial style building follow the signs to go around the left of the main entrance of the hotel and then go up the stairs to find the long bar service is fine not especially attentive no one came to check on us after we would finished our first round of drinks oh and did i mention that it is ridiculously overpriced you will be paying sgd  for a cocktail sure it is the original and it is fairly strong even if served in a small glass and i guess you have the cool vibe of being able to eat the complimentary peanuts and throwing the shells on the floor like they did in the old days but still that is a steep price to pay i would go out here for one drink as a tourist and no more,Negative
long-bar,what can i say i drank the sling i ate the peanuts i came back for more the next day we had a lovely chat with the estonian manager as well as a travel writer who sat next to us for our pre happy hour happy hour it is one of those easy bucket list moments that delivers arrive between  pm for fewer crowds at  the line was crazy,Positive
long-bar,recently renovated and reopened in late  it is on the second floor of the raffles hotel and you may need to try a few different stairways and elevators before you find the right one to the bar which makes it a bit of a hidden but historic gem and icon there was a small wait of a couple people when we arrived at pm on a wednesday but we were still seated within  minutes up the winding staircase to a less crowded upper level peanut shells were piled on the floor next to each table as most guests indulged slowly in their high potency and high priced cocktails we ordered a singapore sling sgd and a mocktail version which was basically fruit punch for sgd they did a great job making it feel like a throwback to another time and place drawing on malay plantation themes with mechanical fans wafting across the ceiling but thankfully with modern air conditioning it is a place to indulge in the experience not just the drinks including getting lost in hotel courtyards and considering whether you might have a few more and book a  night room i can think of many worse ways to spend  for two on an afternoon,Positive
long-bar,gimmicky although fun the staff are professional and courteous a little slow although good enough for a quick drink during the afternoon heat singapore sling was delicious and after a couple you can feel the effect nicely,Positive
long-bar,having a singapore sling at raffles is on most people is must do lists when they come to singapore i must admit the first time we came several years ago i was less than impressed with the actual drink and the service but we decided to give it another shot again this trip boy i am glad we did the original sling was delicious and we loved the device that they got from sipsmith to shake them in i do not remember seeing or hearing this on our first trip but it was a cool gimmick the bartender was also very nice  stars instead of  because they price is still insane however i would do the same thing if i were them,Positive
long-bar,this place is overrated yes its a complete tourist trap and if you really love the singapore sling you should come here at least once but the thing is that back in california i never had a singapore sling nor did i really yearn for one we did not have too long in singapore so we wanted to check out all the touristy things first of all  original singapore sling will cost you  usd this is before tax and service charges we got one and we also got the raffles  gin sling for  usd before service charges and tax the prices do not really bother me since it is at a very nice hotel what irked me was the fact they forgot my drink had to wait like  mins since it was so busy service sucked and there was long line to get in if you have a peanut allergy do not come here another thing i found weird is that if this is such a classy place there are peanut shells all over the ground making it look messy on the plus side its all you can eat peanuts for free,Negative
long-bar,craving for an authentic top notch singapore sling in the singapore hot weather took us to the long bar this place made our short trip to singapore complete and also made it a success before visiting the long bar my husband and i did a small self singapore sling cocktail hunting tour and i would say this place out beat everywhere else we have tried giving the fact that this place served the most original ss we were still amazed by how flavorful the cocktail was knowing the fact thay the drink does not contain any egg white but the way it was shake and prepared pushed out its complex flavors and textures looove it,Positive
long-bar,we must have arrived before the long lines formed we waited but a few minutes i am glad i had good company because that was really all i enjoyed here the singapore sling is an overrated sweet drink the peanuts on the floor gross skip it it is not worth it,Negative
long-bar,the singapore sling here has been rummored to to be terrible and it is not good also tried the planter is punch it was pretty bad to worse than the singapore sling everyone in my group agreed as well drinks are very expensive too  to  singapore currancy you can eat a nice meal for that price,Negative
long-bar,when in singapore we wanted to accomplish two things with our visit to long bar  we wanted to see raffles hotel  we had to try the original singapore sling the hotel was named after british statesman sir thomas stamford raffles the founder of singapore the hotel has just had major renovations and the grounds are absolutely stunning the long bar also does not disappoint there was a small queue to be seated at noon on a monday we were seated with a bag of peanuts and two menus the waiter came took our order for singapore slings promptly the original singapore sling will cost you  usd this is before tax and service charges however this is the original and well worth it the recipe seems to be a mystery i think each place in singapore where i ordered a singapore sling tasted differently it is now great to have the original and have a baseline i thought it was great not too sweet and a perfect mid afternoon cocktail if you want to eat anything with this you wo not be able to as they only have a cocktail menu overall you should come here at least once if you are in singapore pro tip if you have a peanut allergy do not come here there is a bag of peanuts on every table and shells all over the floors,Positive
long-bar,i am all for visiting historic places while on vacation but this place just screams tourist trap to me yes it is the birthplace of the singapore sling and yeah the whole country charges a little more for alcohol than you may be used to but this is not some fancy mixology bar so it is really hard to justify spending the  usd for one singapore sling i mean my wife and i did it and the drink was tasty and i even got a tiny buzz from it but almost every bar in this city also serves a singapore sling for much cheaper all the free peanuts in the building wo not recoup that cost service was basic one person sat us down another took our order then took our menus away if you really want to check out this bar just come in do a short lap around and head out the venue is nice to look at but super overrated overall,Negative
long-bar,i expected there to be a crowd of tourists here i expected that everyone would be ordering singapore slings and i expected them to command a premium price like every alcoholic drink in singapore there was not a line i ordered a gin and tonic service was great the atmosphere here which i should note was during reconstruction of the rest of the hotel was really nice classic and upscale and there was not a line when i visited the bartender and servers are great i did not try the peanuts but you should note that you can throw the shells on the floor that makes this the only place where you can legally litter on the floor fun times,Negative
long-bar,a trip to singapore would not be complete without a trip to the long bar at raffles hotel this was my first time here and while i was sticker shocked at the price of a traditional singapore sling it was totally worth it seriously amazing and refreshing the atmosphere was awesome and relaxing they do not allow a ton of people to enter at once so you do not have the deal with the over crowded typical bar scene it was a great time,Positive
long-bar,meh to be fair the hotel is under renovation so this is a little pop up instead of the real deal but to wait in a long line to have a sickly sweet cocktail for  nah lots of better things to do in singapore maybe when the hotel reopens but i would suggest the gin and tonic instead,Negative
long-bar,we were disappointed to see that the hotel and bar were closed for renovations i really wanted my bf to experience having a singapore sling at this iconic hotel that being said they have a pop up long bar set up for us die hard fans who will stop at nothing to get our taste of the singapore sling when you walk in you first get a reminder that durians are not welcome in the bar you can order your singapore sling as well as a few other drinks at the bar and if you are lucky enough to come at the right time you can sit at the bar along the front window or at one of three small high tops it was as good as i remembered it served with a quarter slice of pineapple and a cherry peanuts are still a staple and yes you can still throw your shells on the ground such a cheeky experience worth doing once as a stop in your singapore journey,Positive
long-bar,this famous old world icon nestled i side raffles hotel was a true delight home of the original singapore sling it has fans on the ceiling beautiful wood throughout and marble floors the peanut shells on the floor add an insouciance that enhances the ambiance yes it is expensive but i would not have missed it for the world,Negative
long-bar,unique high priced drinks but what the hell its where the sling originated enjoy i must say what bar can you bring your kids and you can bring your kids and throw the peanut shells on the floor,Positive
long-bar,you cannot make a journey to singapore and not experience the singapore sling cocktail at the place where it was created so needless to say it is the tourist thing to do and while it is not the most amazing bar experience you will have it is certainly not just a touristy thing to do set in the historic raffles hotel the bar takes you to a bygone era one where plantations doted the countryside and where world empires colonized the remote spots on the earth it also does not hurt that they encourage you to throw the peanut shells on the floor but remember only the peanut shells now there is a menu of cocktails but you really should come here for one thing the original singapore sling there are other versions on the menu of course but you really should have the original at about sgd it is a bit pricey and you are probably not going to want to order a second or maybe you do the bar menu selection is what you probably would come to expect and it is a nice nosh to go with your cocktail especially if you want to walk out versus stumbling out service was pretty good and the staff attentive while they were not hovering over you and quick they certainly made you feel comfortable so when it comes to visiting singapore you better make a stop at the raffles and grab a sling at the place where it was made,Negative
long-bar,totally worth it the experience of going to the raffles hotel and having a singapore sling at the long bar make it all worth the price it is one of those touristy things everyone should do,Positive
long-bar,the hefty prices and sugary drinks are customary to raffles i will cut to the chase the drinks are very expensive not great either and there are peanut shells all over the floor there are current repairs but to be finished in august  not a fan raffles not a fan,Negative
long-bar,the raffles hotel in singapore is currently undergoing renovations which means travelers seeking the famous original singapore sling are set to be very disappointed fortunately the hotel has opened a pop up experience around the corner which houses the raffles gift shop and a small pop up bar where you can get the raffles hotel singapore sling without the raffles hotel if you have been to a raffles hotel you will know the decor and ambiance is truly the shining point of their bars the pop up bar lacks all of the decor and there is absolutely no ambiance as tourists cram into the small  person bar of course the reason why we put up with all of this is because of the original singapore sling so that is exactly what i got and i paid a pretty penny for the experience the singapore sling was invented by ngiam tong boon a bartender at the raffles hotel back in  if you forget this fact do not worry as it is plastered everywhere within the small shop there are varying stories about why and how the drink was invented but i have chosen to believe it is because it was deemed inappropriate for women to drink alcohol back in the day so a punch colored drink was a smart way to make drinking socially acceptable for women if you do not already know a singapore sling is a gin based drink for those that do not like gin do not worry the drink tastes basically like juice and i had a hard time believing there was any alcohol in it i guess that is the point they also serve a non alcoholic version of the drink which i saw a few kids order this whole event is marketed as the singapore sling experience and i saw many a solo traveler and some groups come in to the shop starting at am when it opens the staff are nice but they quickly charge you for your drink as soon as you say may i please have it is probably because they do not want you to notice you have just paid  for a cocktail i rolled my eyes and swiped my visa cheers to the experience to be clear i ordered just one singapore sling i also got a glass of water because i have been very dehydrated the past few days but the water was free so were the peanuts that rest on each of the tables this is the singapore sling experience in a nut shell zing but seriously that is literally what this experience consists of will i be back surely not i honestly wish i had been able to go to the real long bar as this experience felt like a waste that being said if anyone asks if i have had a singapore sling in singapore i will proudly say sure have total cost    usd  seah streetsingaporecopy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews,Negative
long-bar,what a disappointment we ordered six drinks and of which i ordered a monkey shoulder whiskey neat i though it was the only bottle but they also carry a gin with the term monkey the server never said there was another liquor which i would think you would confirm especially since i was ordering it neat who orders a gin neat anyway the drink comes out and it is clear i asked her if this was the whiskey and says no i ask to have it replaced and she said no they cannot exchange it wtf i just paid a fortune for a silly singapore sling and other craft drinks at a high end hotel and they do not satisfy my quench i drank the gin which i am not a fan of and left feeling extremely put off i have been to dive bars where the service was obviously less pretentious and they actually cared about making a customer satisfied this bar definitely felt like a tourist trap with it line to get in and it is limited liquor shelf,Negative
long-bar,as the birthplace of the singapore sling this place is super touristy and expensive but worth a visit anyway just to see it even if you are sitting there feeling kinda tongue in cheek like i was because it is just so touristy most people come here to try the actual singapore sling but it was way too expensive for my liking so i just hung out for a bit to check out the atmosphere and because i like historic places the whole place is really dark with dark wood everywhere and dim lighting and a cool curving staircase at night you almost feel like you are underground in some creaky old wooden basement bar with those rectangular green lamps like you often see hanging over pool tables oh and yes the bar itself does live up to its name it is long in general this place exudes a heavy dark historic vibe unfortunately it also exudes a vibe of overweight sweaty cashed up western tourists avoiding the heat and humidity in the darkest air conditioned place they can find which luckily for them is probably listed as one of the highlights of singapore in whatever crappy guidebook they are using to be fair the raffles hotel complex is pretty cool and worth a quick wander to soak up its historic elegance and charm i would just be hard pressed to name it as a highlight of singapore when there are so so many more awesome places to go to and sights to see in this city it was also very noisy and crowded on a weekday evening around pm very hard to hear yourself think because of all the buzz and chatter around you of course some might love that tourist energy and claim it is all part of the fun also on offer are peanuts in their shells which people take great relish in crushing and dropping on the floor a la texas roadhouse so yeah definitely stop in have a look splash out the money for a sling if you really want to but just go knowing what to expect then have a look at the charming raffles building itself the courtyards are really lovely with lush tropical foliage set against the graceful white building and at night you can have many of the corridors to yourself for photo ops and if the long bar does not appeal to you the quiet courtyard bar outside just might,Positive
long-bar,if i am gonna pay  for the original singapore sling i better i have some sort of show to come with it my drink was not special they just basically made a mix of  or so drinks combined it together and poured it in the glasses for efficiency no special individual pourings here just a mass production of singapore slings that anyone can do too oh and their nachos is not the same nachos you are used to either,Negative
long-bar,not very customer friendly upstairs bar only has two drink choices they ask you if you want to go upstairs for a table and then try to sit you at bar last call is at   not worth the effort to visit very hard to find once at complex save you time and money  us for a singapore sling many nice places in singapore that appreciate your business,Negative
long-bar,ambiance very nice reminiscent of old british colonial architecture unfortunately the hotel was undergoing renovations so i could not appreciate that the bartender was definitely overworked but maintained a great attitude and professionalism and was very friendly i had two singapore slings since this is where they originated from in  the drinks themselves were very good be careful though expect sticker shock i paid  singapore dollars for two drinks which translates to between  and  us dollars i think for a one time experience that is fine but i would definitely not go there again and only because of the price everything else was worth it,Negative
long-bar,over rated with poor service the staff did not bother to refresh our drinks and their attitude was scruffy for a place like this what is worse i was with tourists but at least they got to see the real the long bar not the one from the brochures,Negative
long-bar,i heard this place was a tourist gimmick so i did not have my hopes up however i found this to be a very cool bar with excellent cocktails the singapore sling is perhaps a little overpriced and sugary but was actually pretty good their other cocktails are in my opinion even better i would recommend going even if all you have is one of their excellent nonalcoholic drinks the style of the place and the service were excellent,Positive
long-bar,i am not sure why people seem to want to complain about the price yes it is expensive for a drink alcohol aside from beer is expensive in singapore period singapore is not cheap for much of anything which anyone can tell you before you even get on your flight singapore does not manufacture liquor so it is all imported that being said i decided to end my first night in singapore here it was a lovely just for the experience which is the reason most people go yes there is a ton of tourists it is a bar in a famous hotel not shocking but it was not at all over crowded and it was cool to meet people mostly couples from other places i loved the huge mechanical fans swaying the style reminded me of something out of an old movie i only came from a drink so i cannot comment on food but my singapore sling was perfect i was feeling tipsy before i was even halfway through so one was enough go for the history the experience sip slowly,Negative
long-bar,one of the most touristy things to do in singapore is go to the long bar in the historic raffles hotel and have a singapore sling i had slight reservations about forking over  for a cocktail but it sounded like something we needed to do on our first and most likely last trip to singapore as we sat at the bar we learned that this year the singapore sling turns  the famous cocktail was created in  by bartender ngiam tong boon the story goes that at the time women were prohibited to drink alcohol boon got around this by creating a cocktail that resembled fruit juice which made it acceptable to drink there are many varieties of the singapore sling being light weights we chose one that was champagne based we enjoyed eating the free peanuts and tossing some of the shells on the floor fyi this is the only place in singapore where littering is permitted dwe had a great time here and having a singapore sling was one of the most fun memories of the trip,Positive
long-bar,super cute place i went with a couple of my mba colleagues during our international business trip and we loved it ambiance it is on the second floor of the famous raffles hotel which is absolutely beautiful it has a colonial tropical relaxed feel to it as you walk up the stairs there are a lot of high end stores along the way the hotel has really cute architecture and water fountains that you can take pictures at the bar itself is pretty old school something right out of a movie everything is wood with white and black tile floors a bit of a high ceiling with unique shaped fans they also provide peanuts in a burlap bag with their name printed on it the peanuts are really small but tasty and you can throw the shells on the floor drinks singapore sling that is why people come here it is super expensive but it is tasty i had some of my friends drink but i just ordered a tsingtao beer service quick we had a waitress come to get our orders right after we sat down she checked on us before overall it has a really cool vibe very chill come by just to check it out you will spend money but singapore overall is pricey they have tasty drinks and peanuts,Positive
long-bar,this review is for the long bar only the colonial style white as snow raffles hotel is certainly a sight you must see wander around the lush gardens but save yourself the  for a silly cocktail that none of the locals drink i followed anthony bourdain is advice and skipped the singapore sling the bar tender was nice enough not to pressure me and made me a fresh lime juice for  yes you are reading this correctly it is not a typo the bar with it is slow moving ceiling fans and dark wood could set you back in time if it were not for obnoxious groups of tourists in sweaty tank tops that got dropped off in bus loads top it off with whiny rugrats for total buzz kill,Negative
long-bar,a bit of an odd place got an invitation after buying some spirits for a drink at the long bar thought there was time so why not the concept is fantastic an established brand like raffles a functional bar limited seating tucked away upstairs of the main alcohol duty free shop in terminal  there is some spirits available for tasting and the invitation will get you one small cocktail with various spirits that are on sale while sipping on your drink walk around to look at the displays of hendrick is gin johnnie walker glenfiddich absolut vodka stay away from the new oaked barrel stuff it is just plain weird go through to the wine and rare whisky room and feel good about the amount of money you have spent in comparison for what you could have me could not spend on these fancy rare bottles this place could be more than what it is they could actually turn it into a functioning bar if they wanted to and leverage the raffles brand more having said all that who would turn down a free cocktail enjoy,Negative
long-bar,the long bar is famous for creating the singapore sling i have tried the singapore sling in other places such as singapore airlines but i gotta say nowhere does it as good as the long bar its not cheap i think it was  buts they do a really good job there are also other variations such as the summer sling winter sling etc for such a steep price you also get to eat peanuts and you can throw the shells on the ground the long room feels like an old british bar which is pretty cool,Positive
long-bar,like other yelpers i felt very compelled to come and have a singapore sling at the home of the drink at the hotel it was very very crowded but we were able to snag a couch area in the middle of the bar where we happily sank into comfy couches to relax our feet and indulge in a classic drink the bar looks like it could be from an older movie set and with the peanut shells everywhere it does have a certain appeal and air of an older time yes it is expensive but the reality is that all of the cocktail bars we went to in singapore were expensive so it is probably on average about   more than the other cocktails i had on my trip i got the classic singapore sling which was fruity topped off with a generous pineapple chunk and frothy from shaking it was not very strong sadly but maybe it is one of those drinks that sneaks up on you over time i would say come here once for a drink and the novelty if you are in the area enjoy the atmosphere eat a lot of peanuts and leisurely sip your drink,Positive
long-bar,ok so sure the long bar is touristy and the singapore sling drink will be expensive but i mean come on you already know that coming into the place if you dont want to deal with it then dont make this part of your itinerary during your singapore vacay haha me and justin b expected the crowds the touristy nature and the cost but we still decided to come anyway because well we were in singapore and we wanted a singapore sling haha just getting to the long bar by walking through the raffles hotel was a pretty cool experience though getting that colonial feel and the art work leading up the stairs to the bar was fun when we reached the bar we were seated at a table since the bar was full i liked the actual decor of the bar itself too loved the ceiling fans we didnt even need to look at the menu because of course we were ordering singapore slings haha  drink will set you back about  usd but hey when in rome right while waiting for the drinks the peanuts on the table served as a nice snack too the drink itself was really delicious and easy to drink we only stayed for the  drink but im glad that we visited and i can now say that i have had an original singapore sling in singapore haha,Positive
long-bar,this is the most overrated destination in singapore i have been here twice and both times the service was awful they stuck us in a corner and basically forgot about us we ordered french fries and waited  minutes for them when we finally got their attention the manager flat out told us we never ordered it they also charged us an obscene amount for water bringing out four expensive bottles of water you would think water would be free singapore slings are alright but not worth the price the food was average service was terrible price is ridiculous save your money,Negative
long-bar,yes i did have an original singapore sling could you really fault me for that though the bar was beautiful and dressed in how shall i say relaxed tropical luxury very well then it was relaxed tropical luxury and i enjoyed every minute of it lots of white paint and clean well scrubbed furnishings beautiful people and weather but oddly a lot of crows hanging around who could not be rid of oh and a great tropical drink too,Positive
long-bar,so i am told that one must visit the long bar for a singapore sling when in singapore as an obedient tourist following the crowds i joined my fellow travelers and sipped on a deliciously overpriced drink  usd while munching on bland peanuts it was fun to visit and learn about this famous drink but otherwise nothing that would make me want to return,Negative
long-bar,this is where the singapore sling was created if that sentence excites you then you wo not mind playing  singapore dollars for one of their signature cocktails if the first sentence does not excite you you will find yourself in an crowded and overpriced bar not much else to say,Negative
long-bar,you come here for the singapore sling at raffles hotel honestly i think it is a tourist trap because you pay an arm and a leg for a drink you could easily get anywhere else but you need to get the singapore sling at raffles hotel i believe it came out to about  us dollars for one glass souvenir glass not even included but if you are a sucker like me and need to do the tourist thing then you have to try the singapore sling at the raffles hotel at least once,Negative
long-bar,ah the long bar a tourist trap if ever there was one now do not get me wrong this truly is a beautiful bar and will conjure a feelings hemingway and other notables as soon as you enter the bar it exudes old world colonial charm all the way but that charm comes at a high price first so many tourist frequent the long bar that locals rally are not hanging out here which if you are concerned about authentic flavor you want to be were the locals are singapore locals are cool always willing to clue you into the best bar the best hawker stand or the best anything secondly you are probably here for the singapore sling because someone said you should well at  you may want to rethink that experience one reviewer said that the long bar was the saddest places in earth filled with tourist sipping on the overpriced sling i do not know if i would necessarily go that far but i think you should realize that for the most part this is a tourist thing but sometimes it is fun to play tourist as long as you know what you are getting into,Positive
long-bar,so its a bit of a tourist trap but how many people will come to singapore without doing drinks at raffles singapore is not cheap for booze to start with and of course you are paying sing  for a sling so that bar bill can rack up quickly it is however the experience you go for its raffles and wandering through the hotel grounds enroute to the long bar is nice service is patchy in the bar been  times now so sometimes good other times waiting ages to get served you also get the sack of peanuts and of course you should be dumping the shells on the floor cute colonial decor great ceiling fans and some nights there is live music and the bands playing are great food was ok had a decent burger post flight last time and it was great but then had one before and it was a bit dry so ok for me needs to be more consistent but the tourists will still go anyway cause it is raffles,Positive
long-bar,the long bar has my thumbs up for character and originality u can eat peanuts and throw the shells on the floor u can dance crazily to live bands and nobody cares it is an iconic destination in singapore with so much history and of course the original cocktail the is ingapore sling unlike many other bars in singapore the sling here is made with real juice and bits and bobs rather than pre mixed mixers it is refreshing and is well worth the  sing dollar plus taxes very touristy and a must visit when you are in singas no reservations required,Positive
long-bar,long bar is a place that you visit just because well because there is so much history attached to it it is where the singapore sling was originally created yes that is right the singapore sling cocktail is actually created in singapore unlike the ubiquitous so called singapore fried noodles rice found in americanized chinese restaurants in the us that have no roots whatsoever in singapore long bar is located on the nd flr of the raffles hotel this historic colonial hotel is beautiful especially in the evening with its facade lit up the most visible character of long bar is the concept of in shell peanuts served to guests you crack open the shell pop the peanut into your mouth and throw the shells on the ground there is also a live filipino band that performs though the night we were there it was more of a golden oldie type of band rather than a band who plays their rendition of current hits i am not sure if this the usual since i have only been once most guests are non locals and i can understand why long bar feels a little lackluster for those looking for a trendy place for those with a colonial nostalgia long bar is where you can spend a couple hours at in the evening the singapore sling cocktail is s  that is a bit steep but hey it is the long bar not gonna lie i prefer an old fashioned cocktail anytime,Positive
long-bar,i went to the long bar in singapore on    it is located in the historic raffles hotel it was my st time there i went there to have a singapore sling does not everybody i am not going to complain about the price after all i came halfway across the world to have it i was not disappointed this is where the singapore sling was invented plus i took photos,Negative
long-bar,two stars for the meh experience but it is such an icon that it gets a gift of one star it is definitely one of those must do things on a first visit to sg but have one singapore sling original recipe duh drink in the history and get out there will be buckets of peanuts on the table feel free to throw the shells on the floor it is expected,Negative
long-bar,long bar you have one job one job sling red pineapple juice to hot and sweaty tourists you should practically have a production line for these diabetes inducing drinks carton to table in  seconds what i do not expect is to have to flag down a waiter  minutes after i order two signature drinks inquiring about their whereabouts speaking of waiters let is talk about the service charge if i am paying an obligatory  extra for service i expect some service for example someone should come to my table at least once and ask something along the lines of how is your overpriced pineapple juice would you like to order some food how about a  burger actually regardless of the improvements you could make people will still come even if they do not like pineapple juice they will come for the sake of being proper tourists hell if i could get away with charging  for fruit juice grenadine and people still came to my bar in droves i would not change a damn thing either long bar do you i ai not mad,Negative
long-bar,made a point of coming here to drink the singapore sling and was not disappointed loved the bar and i am guessing they have kept it to the original definitely a tourist trap and they make a killing at  a glass the most i have ever paid for a cocktail really glad we made the effort to go they also served peanuts in the shell they have a box that you can put the shells in but i noticed many just threw them on the floor,Negative
long-bar,hmm how to describe this place cruise ship bar dave and busters retirement home for old western folk more tacky than charming i suppose for some people they like the feeling of dropping stuff on the ground drinks are just ok the drink list is quite small and you cannot even order all of the drinks my fourth choice is what i went with i am only here because an out of town guest was curious,Negative
long-bar,like any other tourist i found myself at the long bar to try there signature drink the singapore slinger i was pre warned it be pricey and it was s  my friend only got a water and it was s  which seems even crazier than the drink but i like the drink and wow the peanuts were amazing never had peanuts that tasted so good before the drink itself was good overpriced but worth a try if it is in your budget the bar had this great old time feel to it really enjoyed the ambiance we got lucky and walked right it but at times there were very long lines and service could have been better we were ready to go but our server was nowhere to be found to collect our check and pay so that someone else could have our seat worth a stop if it is in the budget and for sure try some of the peanuts they made it worth it,Positive
long-bar,i brought some friends over to try the singapore sling where it was created and it is indeed the best i have tasted it is also the most expensive at  i think i was the only singaporean there when i visited the ambience is perfect for tourists bringing to mind old style colonial singapore peanuts are free flow and it is one of the rare places where you can flick the peanut shells on the floor without repercussions there is a live band that plays at night on the upper floor there may be a queue in the early evenings on weekends so be prepared no reservations are accepted,Positive
long-bar,ready to tick have a singapore sling at raffles off that bucket list ok then best you get yourself to long bar bring money i am going to give a completely honest review of this place i have been to singapore before and avoided this spot but on a day when we had nothing to do and walked right past it we thought what the heck we are tourists after all let is see what the fuss is about the inside itself is quaint filled with old banker lights and fans that swing side to side it is bustling at all times of day and night filled with people from all over the world that have decided they must get their singapore sling from raffles that is where the charm begins and ends to start the drinks are priced to take advantage of tourists a singapore sling will cost you  and it is quite frankly revolting let is be honest here it is a terrible cocktail and they are pumping them out on mass so there is little care going into your drink to add insult a pint of tiger will cost you almost the same price so for one cocktail and one beer we were stung more than  plus tax there is the quirk of it being the only place in town that allows littering with the floor covered in empty peanut shells i do not know how or why this is appealing it is disgusting and your bar stool is likely covered in other people is filth finally there is the clientele the bucket list crowd which by the look of the average age could be just about any day now think cruise wear grey hair george costanza is father would not look out of place here so there you have it if drinking a poorly tasting overpriced beverage in a pool of peanut shells and seniors sounds like something that floats your boat then yes you must have a singapore sling at raffles,Negative
long-bar,historic tourist stopthis beautiful bar has remained unchanged for many many years famed for inventing the singapore sling originally a ladies drink it has become a favorite for tourists including bus tours treat it as a once in a lifetime stop enjoy it do not quibble over the wildly expensive drink i had a singapore sling which is actually a very weak drink and the lamb satay for lunch all for,Positive
long-bar,when in rome or in this case singapore stop in at the long bar located at the raffles hotel for a singapore sling the drink was overpriced but the straw fans and colonial architecture of this stunning inspired by the plantations of s malaysia was pretty cool and well worth the adventure,Positive
long-bar,ahh the birth place of the famous singapore sling the long bar is an overcrowded overpriced tourist trap it tended to be under staffed with staff not having time to look after the patrons when i visited we were quickly rushed in and  minutes later asked what we would like to order we noticed that our waiter was told off by the boss for not moving and serving quicker the drinks arrived  minutes later and were sweet and fun i asked twice for a glass of water as i am extreme lightweight and was told it was coming it never came from the time we arrived and got through the shambolic queue we were about  minutes and then prompty and quickly ushered out once the drinks were empty so off we went on our woozy way underwhelmed there was nothing really special about this place however i am glad i went and tried it out but after being once i am in no rush to return i think for the price paid there are much better bars to visit,Negative
long-bar,atmosphere is cool feels like an old historic pub prices not cool  service charge and  tax on top of a  burger or  singapore sling and as others have said you are hanging with old tourists service was a little slow but very nice,Positive
long-bar,so the last time i came here the waitress assumed my  year old father was my boyfriend umm yuck i am not a really a fan of the sugary singapore sling but long bar is where they were invented and so that might warrant a visit in itself the bar is gorgeous just like the historic raffles hotel where it is located the peanut shells strewn all over the floor make for a casual and fun atmosphere and on the night we visited the cover band was more than entertaining kind of a chill spot to hang out with the parents and listen to some music,Positive
long-bar,i would just like to say anyone who says the singapore sling is worth the s  you pay for it is a frigign liar and attempting to look pretentious because they are okay with paying that much for gin and juice no snoop dogg or snoop lion depends on how old you are why am i fan of this place  it is gorgeous i am sure it is renovated but the dark wood and fake original floor tile i think provides a relaxed setting i was expecting it to be pretentious it was not at all i mean it is in the spectacularly beautiful iconic raffles hotel you expect it to be a bit more glam but it was perfection  the singapore sling s  was really delicious it was also expensive but i really enjoyed it i will probably never buy another one from this place though  it is cool i mean michael jackson thought it was a solid enough hotel to rest his head and he is the king of all the musics yes musics apparently going to singapore and not going to place where the original singapore sling was created is not a good idea you just must so i must would i am glad i did and can say i did ultimately long bar is a tourist spot go and enjoy it,Negative
long-bar,nice ambiance and staff nothing against raffles as a hotel but the whole you have to go to raffles and have a singapore sling at the long bar is not something i would classify as a must now that i have experienced it price with tax a singapore sling comes to  not a huge deal however what was disappointing was that this was the st cocktail i have had in  months due to working in a dry country and i did not even feel the slightest of anything from my  singapore sling i am a lightweight and usually feel something anything when i consume alcohol which leaves me with the impression that there was very little no alcohol in this drink for for the management ensure that bartenders put sufficient alcohol in your singapore sling mix especially if asking patrons to shell out  drink otherwise there is no payoff for enduring such a bad tasting cocktail,Negative
long-bar,while it was easily the most touristy thing i did in singapore as pricey as expected i still enjoyed it that might be partly because the place was not jam packed as it was early afternoon on a weekday but it was also a cool bar with a classically quaint atmosphere service was fine too the singapore sling itself was quite good for a sweet girly drink i think the bill was  sgd for a total of  of them which comes to around  usd per sling these days on a relative scale i do not recall paying less than   sgd for a pint anywhere in singapore plus they give you free peanuts woo hoo at long bar,Positive
long-bar,raffles is the classic place in singapore where every english tourist wants to stay or visit the long bar is the home of the singapore sling we decided to go to raffles on christmas day for cocktails before dinner the bar itself is great classic colonial with fabulous colonial fans etc but the singapore slings were hugely overpriced and overall for the experience it was not really worth it  drinks cost us more than  sgd so if it is one of those things on your to do list that you really want to do then do it for the experience and suck up the more than  sgd a drink cost we probably wo not come back i am sure we will find some other great bars in singapore at a fraction of the cost,Positive
long-bar,interesting historic place that boasts the creation of the singapore sling fun to sit at the bar and throw peanut shells on the floor drinks are higher priced but not outrageous and i prefer beer over the syrupy sing slings afterwards eat in one of the raffles restaurants or take a short walk to chjimes for more atmosphere and the quaint but just so so cuisine spots there i love this neighborhood,Positive
long-bar,friday and saturdays there is live music on the second floor very lively the peanut shells are part of the decor so do not mind it it is full of tourist like myself but had to try the singapore sling at its place of origin,Negative
long-bar,father in law us in town so i took him to raffles for the obligatory singapore sling the first thing i noticed upon entering is the overwhelming stink coming through the own doors the bar smells as if it has not been cleaned in weeks the drink was good the price exorbitant but i knew what to expect from past experiences,Negative
long-bar,yes it is a tourist destination but if originality is important to you then you gotta do what you gotta do however if you have a really bad peanut allergy you should avoid at all costs as there will be peanut shells everywhere located on the second floor in the corner of the raffles hotel walking into long bar makes you feel like you are taking a trip back in time to the british colonial era i love the asian style fans that that they hang from the ceiling according to my cousin this is probably the only place in singapore where you are allowed to litter so enjoy cracking those peanuts and knocking those shells on the floor personally i like the singapore sling i find it fruity and refreshing it does not taste too strong alcohol wise and i do not get much of a buzz after one i cannot remember the exact price but it was between   pricey but hey when in singapore right i will admit that i have never tried the sling at another bar so if there is a spot on that island that serves a better version i would be willing to give it a try if you are not going to try the singapore sling i recommend just sticking with wine beer or hard liquor i tried another cocktail a while back it was the philippine answer to the singapore sling but it was nothing to yelp about i would not worry too much about dress code as every one seems relaxed after all there is peanut shells in the crevices of the couches and chairs but if you want to err on the side of caution smart casual is the way to go,Negative
long-bar,i like the history and the bar yes over priced but it is a cool spot for a singapore sling raffles is a beautiful hotel and one you should walk around,Positive
long-bar,it is one of those things where you have got to do it once lovely bar good service very expensive though,Positive
long-bar,came here for the original singapore sling i paired it with  satay skewers for  stupidly overpriced as most places in singapore are but i knew what i was getting into the place is really cool located in the beautiful raffles hotel the bar staff was very attentive and friendly my bartender gave me a souvenir raffles shaker even though i did not the two slings you are meant to in order to get one i thought that was a nice gesture free peanuts on the bar the sling was delicious and not one for mixed sweet drinks i also had a  pint of tiger after the satay skewers come in  pieces and you can choose chicken beef lamb or a mix they were very tasty served with peanut dip and some sliced onion and cucumber very satisfying i would not make it a regular spot due to the prices but it is definitely worth the splurge just to say you did,Positive
long-bar,i had never heard of a singapore sling before booking my flight to singapore it was however literally the only thing my wife knew of singapore which included what continent it was on so we had to go the prices were high i knew that going in but with the exchange rate it is not just obscene i scoured reviews trying to determine if you got the glass with it for the  price i can now confirm that you do not i ordered some very interesting beer in a large beaker like thing and my wife got the obligatory sling which she enjoyed we got the nacho appetizer and i would advise skipping it mixed bag wife enjoyed and said she felt like she was back in the  is or something i felt like the decor could have been much better to convey that there were even decorative items above the bad that literally had the bar code on them for example it is probably a must do if you are looking to fulfill your touristy obligations,Negative
long-bar,the long bar at the historic raffles hotel is one of those things you have to do when coming to singapore for the first time this is after all the birthplace of the singapore sling a cocktail that really has no significance outside the island nation after which it is named make no mistake this is a very touristy thing to do on a warm sunday afternoon the place was packed although i had been here before this was my colleague is first time to singapore and suggested a trip to the long bar we managed to get two stools at the bar and squeezed in the bartenders are consumed with cranking out slings so it takes awhile to get their attention to place your order what comes back is a very pink perhaps too sweet concoction of gin cherry heering dom benedictine cointreau pineapple juice lime juice grenadine and angostura bitters at  sgd about  us this is an expensive drink even by singapore is exorbitant alcohol prices but there is a quaint charm to the place and it is cool to sit at a bar that is probably  years old just keep it to one drink which we did not but do as i say and not as i do and you will be fine do not bother to get the food here it looks pretty bad,Negative
long-bar,tacky over priced expensive drinks theyre riding the singapore sling drink to death  for a cocktail in a cheesy tiki ish bar tried it because it was famous but it was pretty lame do not say you have not been warned,Negative
long-bar,if you have a guest in singapore take them here for a singapore sling this is the only place to ever order that drink otherwise its crap the original place where they invented the sweet concoction of the sling but be warned b c it is pricey here when i turned  in the states i knew when i came back to visit singapore i wanted to order a singapore sling from long bar in the middle of the afternoon i remember ordering two of these ok more than  years later i am still a lightweight and being happy drunk in the middle of the day with a face that said asian glow to the taxi line at raffles city shopping center and practically passing out in the cab hahaha good times i took a friend to here last week to enjoy a singapore sling i ordered a virgin sling because i am lame and did not feel like drinking that night due to the fact i had to work the next day and she ordered the regular they messed up the order and brought two regular slings yea i could taste that one was stronger than the other i sipped a bit of the drink and then had to call the waiter over they charged us for two regular slings the took away the sling and replaced it with a virgin version and did not charge us for the sling or the virgin version that was really nice of them to do that the ambiance in the long bar takes you back to a different colonial past but the ac really is freakin cold the live band was lively and people were dancing in front of them which was really cute not a mosh pit or a club type atmosphere so the total classy factor of this place is perfect it was a weekday so the place had tables of tourists and older expats i am a big fan of raffles hotel and its one of my favorite places in singapore to take tourists because its that british colonial old world luxurious charm about the whole place and they have the best souvenir store selling the classiest gifts too,Positive
long-bar,i was looking forward to my visit to the famous raffles hotel during my recent trip to singapore having read guide books and also got personal recommendations i thought we were in for a bit of a treat i was sadly very mistaken the hotel itself looks grand and if your going you should perhaps try one of the other swisher bars but i would definitely avoid the long bar the long bar lacks atmosphere the free peanuts and the fashion of chucking the shells on the floor makes the place generally feel a bit dirty the drinks prices are extortionate and when my chosen tipple came out to me the tonic with my gin was flat this places is a total tourist trap and i would suggest avoiding at all costs,Negative
long-bar,this is supposed to be the home of the original singapore sling and they have designed the bar to feel as such but it says right on the menu that it was remodeled and relocated in  this is truly built as a tourist trap playing on their history in an effort to bring in more suckers they have even recreated the bar twice on two levels giving everyone that wonderful authentic feel i suppose the peanuts concept is supposed to be how british officers relaxed decades ago or perhaps they are provided in all their salty glory to make you thirstier and drink more and as an appetizer to order more food but do not worry if you get thirsty from those peanuts they will happily sell you overpriced still or sparkling bottled water they will not serve you tap water they will not take a glass and open the tap to quench your thirst the ice filled cocktails are most certainly not made with bottled water as singapore has some of the cleanest tap water in the world the iconic singapore sling has been partnered with   alternate slings to cater to most tastes and the drinks are good overly sweet but what one would expect it is most likely mass produced in a jug and just poured over ice but this is not an artisanal bar and honestly s  per drink is about right even reasonable for a drink in singapore especially at a popular bar the refusal to serve tap water angered me the straw to break the camels back was the scam artist style promotions they advertise on some menus seriously not all had this that every second order of a singapore sling will get you a complimentary singapore sling shaker they also advertise that any food orders will get you a complimentary shaker as well first when we ordered a dessert a shaker should have been brought out no ifs ands or buts but instead when we were later presented with our bill and then our credit cards to sign we had to ask for the shaker the food based shaker was willingly offered the two sling based shaker was not offered they interpret every second order to be per person over two rounds the words per person or rounds are not listed anywhere the waiter was kind enough to relent and give us the   valued plastic shakers after much argument but the irritant is as i stated scam artist operations banking on people to forget their shakers and vaguely wording their menu all to encourage upsells i will likely be back under protest with the next family in town but my advice is to avoid the peanuts hydrate before you enter and bring your lawyer if any promotions catch your eye,Negative
long-bar,i love this hotel the decor and all that it represents is very colonial singapore historic beautiful and charming i have heard about this bar since it is very popular for their singapore slings and only had the opportunity to visit it a few months ago i was somewhat surprised the music and ambiance was very nice the music was jazz pop and i was fully entertained i thought it was pretty shocking that you were allowed to throw your peanut shells on the floor the only place in singapore where littering is encouraged haha that sorta did make my day though i did not participate it was pretty interesting what i love the throwing your peanut shells on the floor bit that was pretty fun the music the ambiance which is very chill was nice what i do not love unfortunately the singapore sling which we went there for was quite a dud it was pretty boring i have had better singapore slings elsewhere the ones i get on singapore airlines is wayyyy better than this bar and each drink is  ish so  drinks including tax and peanuts would set you back a whopping  yes i know,Negative
long-bar,it is worth the visit here for the old time brit feel the food drinks and prices will make you wish you did not or grow in dislike for colonialism but it is on the must do list but the custom beverages are basically pure syrup,Positive
long-bar,i know i know when in rome right this is another one of those places that you just have to visit while in singapore it was here that the singapore sling was invented so the only proper touristy thing to do is cozy up to the bar and order one that will set you back almost  and no you may not keep the glass it is kind of neat to sit back and soak up the historical colonial plantation style decor of the raffles hotel hailing back to singapore is exotic colonial days i recommend this as a mid afternoon stop right when you are drenched with sweat and ready to pass out from heat exhaustion once you have cooled off but never dried out downed your drink and tried to contemplate what the fuss is all about you will be ready to check singapore sling off your list and move on,Positive
long-bar,every should do this once while in singapore while shopping near beach rd good craft drinks with free peanuts and shells subsequently all over the floor drink prices are expensive even by singapore standards if you go mid afternoon mid week there will be little to no crowd sit back and enjoy the colonial atmosphere while sipping a singapore sling if you fly singapore airlines on the way home have a couple of more for free they have bottled the recipe,Positive
long-bar,the original location of the singapore sling the raffles hotel is the place to go if you want the original recipe of the famous drink when you first walk in you will notice the floor is littered with peanut shells crunch crunch its because peanuts are free while you are here and when you de shell the peanuts you just casually toss the shells over your shoulder onto the floor i think i was more excited about the unlimited peanut shell tossing than the drink itself haha,Positive
long-bar,this is a must see and do in singapore this is a beautiful bar that has sophisticated elegance class history shiny rich mahogany wood throughout the bar it is undoubtedly an architectural gem and landmark it is also the home of the original singapore sling be prepared to pay for that originality it was about  american dollars before tip great ambiance beautiful bar it is also located in walking distance to some amazing sites it is perfect for a romantic night stroll after a few drinks,Positive
long-bar,it is a nice looking bar in a historical colonial sort of way which is why this is a two star review and not a one bottom line is you pay  including tax and auto service charge for an over sweet cocktail made from a bottom shelf gin gordon is this being the original singapore sling which is presumably what everyone is here to try i know it is tempting to do this but really it is not worth it this drink will likely forever remain as the single biggest gap between quality of drink and amount i paid for it i will ever have  for a gordon is cocktail what was i thinking,Negative
long-bar,yes it is expensive but what would you expect from the place of the original singapore sling the drink is tasty and overpriced and again i knew this going in i would not go back just for the drink by myself assuming i had other with me that had not been there it is a must stop just eat lost of free peanuts,Negative
long-bar,it is hard to add much to what is already been said about this must do once experience a bit overrated compared to pat o briens in new orleans where at least the signature drink has a kick maybe on par with harry is bar on venice i enjoyed my  sling but probably wo not return unless i have the pleasure of staying at raffles,Negative
long-bar,there was no yelp in singapore when i was there back in april to my knowledge but i figured it is never too late to yelp the places i visited when i was there especially since i was pretty detailed in my blogging about my trip haha anyways my friend and i were only in singapore for a few days and this was a place i really wanted to hit up we checked out long bar at raffles hotel after a trip around the night safari we caught a cab straight to raffles hotel and had quite a bit of an adventure looking for this bar let me first say that we were there on a tuesday night so we were not exactly sure it would still be open we were dropped off in front of the main doors of the hotel and did not see a soul so we walked around the premise of the hotel we found a restaurant that with a sign on it saying that long bar was closed we tried asking a worker for directions because the restaurant did not look anything like what i imagined the bar to look like the directions were not very clear so we wandered around a bit we went up and down the stairs and did not find the place until we were about to give up we probably spent   minutes wandering looking for it by the time we found the place we were told that they were about to close but they allowed us in when we told them we just wanted a quick drink they offered a number of different versions of the singapore sling i have never had one before but i figured if i knew where it was invented i should definitely try it it was very fruity and sweet and i quite enjoyed it the first thing you will notice when entering the bar however is that the floor is covered with peanut shells they had a heaping bowl of peanuts on each table and customers are encouraged to just drop their shells on the floor that was definitely unlike anywhere i have been in the past i wish i could have found the place earlier and on the weekend because i would not mind chilling their a bit longer so to summarize if you do not want to read my all that i liked the place the peanut floored atmosphere was super cool the drinks were good butttt it was hard to find for us at least  and it was very pricey our total of just two drinks came out to  including tip definitely was one of my most expensive drinks  yelps challenge,Negative
long-bar,please leave this off you are to do list while in singapore there is no magic to a singapore sling unless you want to buy two just so you can get the  dollar glass it is a cluster f k of tourists better to enjoy the local places just outside the hotel the people here are awesome go say hello and get to know them,Negative
long-bar,this place is a contrived tourist trap if i ever saw one but it was still fun to sip a singapore sling which is an overly sweet and pricey abomination of a cocktail eat some tiny but addictive peanuts and people watch what you will see douchey old guys in tommy bahama and trophy wives for days so you will feel like you have been transported to a whole other world south orange county which was fine with me i felt right at home in short the long bar is definitely not destination quality but a good pit stop if you are feeling homesick,Positive
long-bar,sucks  bucks for a singapore sling  bucks for a tiger beer you have to be kidding this place is a rip off if you must stick your head in the door and take a look and then go some place else,Negative
long-bar,over priced drinks slow service and crappy food the signature drink the sling was not anything special service was equally disappointing especially considering the bar was not full it took them  minutes to run credit cards an establishment of this size should have more than  card reader the truffle fries consisted of frozen fries and a strange weird cheesy sauce,Negative
long-bar,this is one of those places that you definitely want to bring your tourist friends to simply because of its history decor and fancy drinks when you walk through the door you get transported back to singapore in the colonial times if you are asian you are the minority simply because every tourist wants to try the singapore sling you get to munch on groundnuts and throw the shells on the floor just like old times dark beech walls lights with english style green shades you get the drift my somerset maugham was excellent for those who are not a big fan of sugary sweet cocktails,Positive
long-bar,the hype was overrated  sgd for a singapore sling that is poured out of a pitcher you have to be kidding me i wish someone warned me in advance as this is not something i would want to pay for,Negative
long-bar,this is a mandatory stop in singapore a place that is ridiculously clean and expensive this was a once in a lifetime stop it is like going back in time in a noir movie here you have to come here for a singapore sling it is like going to new orleans and having a hurricane at pat o is hea is actually it is reminiscant of pat is strong sticky drink and premade in huge quantities kind of a laugher they serve this cheap drinks and then charge anyway i guess you could get drunk here if you spend like   check the place out really unique,Positive
long-bar,i just came to try a famous sling while exploring city on vacation the bartender suggested the  gin sling as i wanted something less sweet it tasted like watered down lime juice and did not come in the fancy sling cup after i finished my drink i waited a while before the bartender finally asked if i wanted another i asked for the bill and waited  minutes before asking again he took my credit card and then i waited another  minutes before walking to the cashier and waiting  minutes this service is unacceptable particularly for such an expensive well known place,Negative
long-bar,i am not going to become a regular here but i am glad i finally tried the obligatory original singapore sling most people i talked to described it as overpriced and watered down yes  is a lot to pay for a cocktail but it would be a shame not to indulge in this touristy mainstay at least once warning the service is absolutely terrible and everything is extremely overpriced not just the sling,Negative
long-bar,a very cool bar where i felt taken back to the old days it was fun to try the original singapore sling as well while the drink was expensive  singapore dollars it was worth it to taste a bit of history,Negative
long-bar,you will come for the original singapore sling and it will be just as expected and much like the ones you have had in other bars around the world the historic feel to the bar including the wooden interiors and the swaying ceiling fans are lovely the bland bland bar food is ridiculously overpriced do not come here hungry or you and your wallet will be very disappointed,Negative
long-bar,i always knew that this was the home of the original singapore sling but never thought to try it last night i was bringing a couple of friends from overseas around and of course the long bar singapore sling popped up to our minds so onward we went we were first of all surprised by how casual the place felt in a good way of course true to its colonial theme it really brought me back to imagining the times of all white clubs and wealthy businessmen exclusively having a celebratory drink in here these days you will see just about anyone here anyone who can afford it at least despite its lack of formalities this is still raffles hotel after all and they still have an expensive image to maintain the average cocktail here would cost you about  as much as you might pay for a decent meal in some places but i do adore the charm of the place and endeared to the monkey nuts thrown all over the place as though the animals themselves ran amock through the two storied bar the cocktail itself was of course some pretty amazing stuff with that perfect mix of all the ingredients even if they did provide the list of liquids that went into it i would never be able to do it quite like that i enjoyed it my friends enjoyed it and i am sure to come back especially on nights when the band is on for my next fling at the sling gotta start saving up,Positive
long-bar,great bar but full of tourists looking to enjoy a singapore sling at the place it was invented its worth a stop if you want to check that off on your singapore bucket list i did the sling is very expensive  for a small beverage but it did taste great the peanuts are great and i also had fried shrimp and that was excellent raffles is a great place to visit so i would recommend a stop at the long bar,Positive
long-bar,must agree that it is overpriced and overcrowded but it is fun to go and see this beautiful hotel and bar that was built in the s and is home of the singapore sling if you are okay with spending money to say you have been then it is worth going but if you are going to fret over the cost than it can easily be skipped without feeling like you missed out i would still recommend walking through the hotel though it brings you back to what you dream of traveling to the south pacific would have been like  years ago,Positive
long-bar,tourist trap ok to stop grab a drink and check it off your punch list food was poor and overpriced service is weak felt like we were being pushed out no offer to get another round of drinks even though we were all thirsty love the history of raffles but this is one spot i would not recommend,Negative
long-bar,excellent singapore slings soggy peanuts ruin the experience,Positive
long-bar,i think its a bit strange i cannot find a single review of this legendary bar so please show me another review if it exists after a short trip from kl me and a friend had one thing on our mind for our  hours in singapore track down this famous bar named long bar and try the singapore sling after leaving our luggage at a hotel in little china we started asking for directions to raffles hotel this proved to be a a hard task because everyone we asked were foreigners working in singapore first we ended up at a place called raffles place which of course had nothing to do with raffles hotel we asked a guard inside but she had never even heard of the hotel thankfully one of her colleagues had a large map over singapore and we finally got the correct directions a little bit later we walked into this famous hotel after looking around for a while i suddenly heard something crack under my foot and i knew we had find it because the stairs in front of us was filled with peanut shells inside we got a table with a bucket of nuts already there for a moment i felt like being back in colonial times with large fans in the ceiling and the whole historical atmosphere we ordered two slings we had no idea what to expect so we were pretty exited about this famous drink when i first saw the pink drink i figured it was probably to sweet for me as i usually prefer stronger drinks but it turned out to be really refreshing and i have no problem recommending it afterwards we ordered two beer is which came served in probably the coolest glasses i have ever seen they looked like something you can find in a chemistry lab only about ten times larger when it comes to prices long bar is not a place to spend much time i believe we spent about  sgd which is even more then the price for  drinks and  beers back here in oslo,Negative
long-bar,as iconic as the hotel it is located in the long bar is the birthplace of the famous singapore sling cocktail the decor was apparently inspired by malayan plantations of the  is and when you enter you feel like you are walking into a timewarp munch on the free nuts and join the clientele mostly tourists there slinging it in carelessly throwing the shells on the floor must try the singapore sling shots bit sweet though,Positive
singapore-flyer,yes it is a tourist trap by definition and it resembles the london eye a bit too much but if it is a reasonably clear day it is still a worthwhile way to soak in singapore is ever changing and ever growing skyline whether or not you are a tourist and if you are it is a great way to orient yourself and get a feel for how the city is laid out like the london eye each capsule is suspended on the outside of the wheel to minimize obstructed views and like the london eye the number of folks who can get into any capsule at any time is limited so that you can get a somewhat personalized and uncrowded experience better yet each capsule is far larger than what i remember from my multiple trips aboard the london eye so there is plenty of room to spread out in this instagram social media and selfie fueled age it is all the more worthwhile if you are hungry for a few good shots and a few more likes so again if it is clear out and you have not been aboard it is worth the splurge,Positive
singapore-flyer,does give you a decent view of the city it is a short ride and path but it is an interesting vantage point it is something to do if you are by the gardens by the bay i think it would be more fantastic if it spanned over the city for longer and more fruitful view of the city it was cool to see the marina bay sands building up a bit closer and to see the soccer field right on the water at least,Positive
singapore-flyer,this is just a review to say how amazing this looks it is great to see it in person wow it is just so big i cannot tell you anything about riding it however because the government had it shut down due to coronavirus scare while i was there so my rating is not to say it is bad or good because i only got to see it from a distance so to speak i will tell you i was sad to find it closed when i got there but like my husband said if you have been on one ferris wheel you have been on them all he is not wrong i suppose i was looking forward to seeing the view from the top i will be back to try it after all of the craziness settles down side note it lights up in the evening and looks phenominal,Positive
singapore-flyer,purchased a voucher from klook very easy redeem just show your voucher from your phone i purchased a voucher that gets you the singapore flyer ride with the buffet from bhandari is saffron restaurant no queue at the time for my group of  stop by the restaurant first to get your singapore flyer tickets youd be asked if you want to have the buffett before or after the ride and we chose the latter the experience was exhilarating this is part of my must try list for my fellow tourists great view of the city from the very sturdy and air conditioned capsule this is something you should not miss,Negative
singapore-flyer,i had such high hopes for the singapore flyer i love ferris wheels if a city has a huge ferris wheel it is probably on my list to do i think i had high expectations since it does give you a birds eye view of singapore however after seeing the view at a neighboring building it just pales in comparison also the capsule glass in which i rode in was dirty i think if i rode the singapore flyer first to see the singapore skyline before going to another location to view the skyline i may have a different opinion on this what is cool about the singapore flyer is that they offer a dinner ride and a ride with champagne or a singapore sling if you ride the singapore flyer after observing the view from another location i would suggest the ride with the drinks,Negative
singapore-flyer,singapore flyer will show you a  view of the city and all the sites it has to offer on one side you will see the bay esplanade the bridge and on the other you will see the skyline marina bay sands gardens by the bay etc there is a voice track for you to follow what you are seeing as you make your way around on the ferris wheel there was no line to get in a pod i would imagine if there was it would go pretty fast considering the number of pods there are and how much space there is in there be prepared to share a pod with others for a good  minutes this attraction is family friendly and good for all ages the elderly children adults and young adults as well it is a unique view of the city but i would bet that there are better spots to see the marina bay sand skyline gardens etc for a better price but if you are limited on time and want to see an aerial view of the city the flyer is the way to go,Positive
singapore-flyer,honestly been to a bunch of these around the world and the one thing that sets this apart is the food underneath it also the fact that they built the entire food court and small fish pond right underneath which to my experience i have never seen before so the engineering aspect is crazy cool besides the gardens view and the bay same experience spend time with friends and family is what it is all about,Positive
singapore-flyer,my son loved the singapore flyer we went as part of the changi recommends tour it had been raining on and off but was only sprinkling on and off during our tour we were fortunate as this meant that we could ride the flyer the tour guide got our tickets while we relaxed after our walk there because of the rain there were not as many people waiting to ride there was a wedding party and it was cute to see the couple so happy we were fortunate that they allowed our tour party of  a car to ourselves looking out we could see many of the attractions of singapore and out towards the ocean when we got to the top we could look all around us as the view was not obstructed by any buildings would ride again as it was fun and a smooth ride might not be as fun if it was crowded but great first experience on the flyer,Negative
singapore-flyer,i had a different kind of experience on the flyer i had dinner in one of the capsules this was a very neat dinner with spectacular views the dinner was great and it was interesting how the staff changed courses they are very fast when bringing food into the capsule it was a nice ambiance and there were only four tables  people total this is the perfect date setting,Positive
singapore-flyer,it was very cool to be able to go high in the skyline to see the magnificent sights of singapore you get an amazing view of this modern city and the harbour that makes business boom around here the tour lasts about  minutes and gives you views of everything along with some great information of the city and tours that are offered the biggest downside to this tour is the price it is pretty expensive we paid spd for  adults and  child to tour it i know this is an expensive city and it costs lots of money to vacation here so just be expecting a large bill to take the ride on a clear day the views are spectacular,Positive
singapore-flyer,i happened to befriend a few americans at one of the speakeasies here in town one recommended the singapore flyer at first i was not keen on doing it because it is super touristy i have been here to singapore multiple times and this attraction was never was on my radar but you know what it was really nice i like that anyone can ride this young or old there are no height or age limitations it goes so slow that you do not even feel it moving yet you get a gorgeous view of the city even if you are afraid of heights do not be it is a great attraction i did not realize how nice the singapore skyline is it can actually rival a few cities singapore you continue to be a favorite and this was wayyyy before crazy rich asians,Positive
singapore-flyer,so i did the touristy thing and did the singapore flyer but i upgraded and did the vip package which came with your choice of champagne or a singapore sling the good news is that there is no line when you do the package but the bad news is that you have to wait for your designated time slot since the vip pod only occurs on certain times you also get to hang out in the lounge air conditioned of course and order drinks too if you are waiting to board nice views and it was a good  minute or so ride,Positive
singapore-flyer,i loved the singapore flyer there was a small line but it moved very quickly we shared our pod with about eight other people which i did not mind because we were able to take pictures for each other the ride is very smooth and slow we went at night and had a beautiful view of singapore all lit up i know you can get good views on the buildings but i am glad we did the flyer we really enjoyed it,Positive
singapore-flyer,the view alone at night is worth it the staff really take care of you the dinner was ok but the view made up for it the soup was a little salty and the desert could have been better but the main was great i would highly recommend the dinner experience,Positive
singapore-flyer,rated highly on tripadvisor i had higher hopes for this and came away with a bit of disappointment you can get similar views within other high rises in singapore but after paying for this i opted not to,Negative
singapore-flyer,i was surprised at how little people go here there was no line for tickets no line to get into the capsule and we had the whole capsule for ourselves considering it is the tallest ferris wheel ever the capsule is big and can probably hold a decent amount of people however perhaps so little people go here is because there really is not much of a nice view to be seen during the day one side looks off into the bay and the other the city skyline it is also expensive even though i found a coupon in one of the tourist maps,Positive
singapore-flyer,in singapore it is all about the views the singapore flyer stands m high and is asia is largest giant observation wheel it takes  minutes for a full rotation and each capsule has a  person capacity the ride is incredibly smooth you do not feel a thing the views are good but after being at the top of multiple buildings in singapore with breath taking views this experience for  singaporean dollars was ok,Positive
singapore-flyer,if you want a nice and stable aerial view of the city of singapore make a short trek to the flyer it is a bit pricey for the tourist attraction but it is worth the trip especially when the day is nice and clear getting to the flyer is fairly easy just follow the pedestrian signs when getting off the mrt and it is roughly a   min walk to the flyer for the flyer itself it resembles a huge ferris wheel with little futuristic pods that you could stand sit inside if you are a high roller or want to treat someone on a special date there are different pods where you can ride the flyer in style and have a fancy lunch or dinner inside for the regular pods it can hold up to at least  people once inside the pod it is around a min ride the ride itself is fairly pleasant stable and smooth if you have motion sickness or anything fear not a friend of mine has severe motion sickness but she was fine throughout the flyer experience without having to take any medications for it most of the time you forget that the wheel is moving due to the pretty sights i highly suggest having enough battery juice for your phone for pictures and such you can travel around your pod and take pictures at multiple angles as you desire and if you are tired of standing there is a nice bench that you can sit and relax overall this was a pretty interesting experience and i would recommend it to any first time visitors to singapore if you want more of an interactive experience that includes an aerial view i would suggest checking out the cable car vs the flyer since there is more to see do,Positive
singapore-flyer,wow the singapore flyer offers an incredible unobstructed view of singapore it is definitely worth every penny you cannot find a view like this anywhere else enclosed in the clear capsule you can look around and see pretty much all the major sights of singapore marina bay sands gardens by the bay the supertrees the dna helix bridge and much more give this a try next time you are in singapore you wo not regret it side note you can also have dinner in the flyer so that is a cool experience worth looking in to if you are considering this attraction,Positive
singapore-flyer,visiting the singapore flyer is an absolute must do while in singapore i personally recommend going right at sunset the lines are gone and chances are you will have the entire capsule to yourself going at sunset gave such a gorgeous view of the city as we crested the top of the wheel the sun went down and the city lit up i have nothing but positive things to say about visiting the singapore flyer the staff is very friendly walking to the flier through the line is also interesting they have turned the queue area into a museum almost there are fun facts about the singapore flyer to be found in addition to some interactive activities,Positive
singapore-flyer,such a great experience super glad i made this last minute attraction stop beautiful views,Positive
singapore-flyer,is it worth it depends on what you are looking for i think the flyer is a good option if you hate wind and do not like going to open air rooftops like the marina bay sands skypark or  altitude it is also a good alternative if you have kids and cannot bring them to a fancy rooftop bar late at night important things to note the flight is unguided if you are just interested in taking pictures it is good but if you are looking to learn more about your surroundings it is not going to cut it this is not the best place if you want a good photo of marina bay sands you only see the side of it not a full frontal shot if you will for the first  minutes you will get good views of the national stadium marina bay golf course gardens by the bay marina barrage and on a really good day you could see indonesia the last  minutes is best to focus on gardens by the bay again artscience museum the city skyline the float at marina bay helix bridge and esplanade theatres on the bay believe it or not what could bring more local foot traffic to the flyer is their venue space it is worth looking into if you are an event planner with a good budget,Positive
singapore-flyer,timed our ride so that we got to the top just as the sun was starting to set so that is the only thing that made it worth the price in my book i was happy to get the half price ticket available for students while it does not have the best views of singapore it does offer pretty darn good views  degrees so it does make a good photo op the  minute trip felt about  minutes too long though especially with a handful of small children running around and complaining i was afraid of stepping on a child every time i turned around there are some cool things that happen sometimes in the special modules i am not sure how much they cost though i would imagine they are pricy the museum type are you walk through before getting onto the flyer is neat i enjoyed reading about its construction but i am pretty nerdy about that type of stuff i spent half the ride looking towards the center of the wheel admiring the mechanics of the attraction it definitely is a one time attraction however not something i would do again,Positive
singapore-flyer,tourist trap or not the singapore flyer is a great way to catch some nice views of singapore i got here in the morning and it was not crowded before getting to the wheel you can spend a few minutes in the museum like room to check out some videos and attractions they have on display line was short and i was able to score my own capsule yesss the capsules are air conditioned so they are comfortable and very easy to move around each angle was a postcard worthy portrait waiting to happen you can spot many of singapore is iconic attractions as well just a fun fact the singapore flyer is the biggest observation wheel in the world yes it is supposedly bigger than the london eye the whole ride takes about thirty minutes and i thought it was worth the time specially if you are in the city for just a few days overall great views during the day i wish i had the chance to see the city light up at night from above book your ticket online so you can go any time of the day instead of having to wait for a specific hour when you purchase the ticket on site solid  stars,Positive
singapore-flyer,the singapore flyer is said to beat the london eye i have been on both now and i do not think either of them is amazing but a big tourist trapyes you get nice views of the city if you book a night time flight but honestly not worth the price if you can get the views elsewhere it takes only a few minutes to get bored of the singapore flyer it was kind of awkward to be stuck in that chamber with another random couplewe went w the singapore sling flight which gets you a ride a free cocktail a souvenir champagne flutenote we booked online and saved  off the tickets using a visa mastercard,Negative
singapore-flyer,it was a great way to spend some quality time with my family and enjoy a good view of the skyline of singapore and the marina bay sands you are pretty much locked up in a spacious well air conditioned capsule with everyone for half an hour,Positive
singapore-flyer,somehow this attraction is not very popular but i can recommend it as it offers valuable views of singapore bay it is a great way to spend a late afternoon while in singapore it is not crowded indeed and it is a stone away from mbs hotel walking distance there are some restaurants too but it does not look like a bustling place so i would rather go back to mbs for dinner after taking lots of photos from the flyer,Negative
singapore-flyer,i am baffled by the many mediocre reviews i see for the flyer it is clearly the consequence of people thinking it too expensive currently s  for a   minute spin no it is not cheap if you find yourself staring at the singapore skyline and you say that is just a ferris wheel over there then do not bother if all you want is a good view of the harbor you should not bother if you want a thrill ride or if you want to feel the cars jiggle as you turn you definitely should not bother but if you walk up to this thing and are awed by the size and beauty and engineering of it or the romance of it then the price wo not matter when the original ferris wheel dropped jaws in  chicago it was more than four times smaller than this marvel it is no longer the largest in the world  feet shorter than the new one in las vegas but it is still amazing for my entire ride i was torn between enjoying the view and watching the giant wheel turn and the cables bend it is also a thing of beauty on the skyline especially at night i am not a ferris wheel aficionado although i grew up in pittsburgh where the original was invented so i cannot speak to how this wheel compares with the other big ones built in the last couple decades but i will say that i would recommend skipping the dining packages we did high tea and while the finger sandwiches and drink options were fine they did pretty much nothing to enhance the experience the wheel itself was a good enough draw on its own,Negative
singapore-flyer,similar to the london eye you get great views of singapore in the comfort of air conditioned capsule most of the capsules had  or fewer people allowing you to easily move around and adjust your location to get the best pictures views we did this during the day but would have preferred to have done it at night unlike the london eye the flyer actually had a small museum that you walk through on your way up to the that actual loading platform a nice addition as others have mentioned the price is expensive but everything in singapore is expensive minus some of the food malls,Positive
singapore-flyer,youtube highlights video youtu be as vzawlucontext we had an  pass from singapore airlines for the hop on hop off tour bus which is a great deal by the way i went to the flyer by myself because parents did not want to gotickets  i know right pricey in my opinion but i was thinking why not get in line which is super short right at the entranceflyer so you walk up the escalator and through this small building with some cool facts and information about the flyer some cool installations but nothing major wow factor they lead you into the flyer and it is a super nice view and i got some super cool shots the flyer goes by super slow which is cool and i think the best part is when you get a view of the flyer and the skyline overall it was a cool experience however it is really pricey,Positive
singapore-flyer,the tallest ferris wheel in the world even higher than the london eye although a much anticipated part of our singapore vacation the actual experience was a bit underwhelming the ferris wheel moves so slowly that it started to get boring after a while they packed so many of us into each cabin that not everyone had a place to sit yes there were gorgeous views of the cityscape along the bay but the windows were so dirty and full of handprints that any attempts at photos were pretty much foiled by smudges on the glass we did enjoy the historic food trail afterwards for hainanese chicken rice oyster omelet and a snow ball that was akin to ice kacang the oyster omelet was way too oily but the other two dishes were pretty good,Negative
singapore-flyer,overlooking kallang river is a  degree slow moving enclosed giant ferris wheel where a panorama view of singapore is twenty minutes for sgd   tourist trap indeed but i thought it was fair to middlin and a keepsake triangle shape in flight compass unfolds to become a circular panorama map is included big woo the circular panorama map of singapore is however a nice keepsake souvenir from my  singaporean adventure there is a audio guide for various languages to describe the various scenes which is also included seats are readily available for those who fear heights private parties are available which includes dinner and drinks atop of earth is giant observation ferris wheel not worth sgd   for the hike atop a giant ferris wheel when there are iconic places actually worth physically going rather than viewing from above this experience only feeds the illusion not the reality of being at a point of interest when one can actually be there supposedly singapore flyer carries the claim as the largest observation ferris wheel big woo,Negative
singapore-flyer,charges way too much for a ride that is lacking there are far better views of the city on the top of marina bay sands takes a while to get to a point where pictures are worthwhile and then you have to snap photos through scratched and glaring glass you will get fatigued on the way down waiting for it to be over the whole area around it feels like it is trying too hard to be a western carnival and forgets traditional and authentic singapore the only reason to come is to take pictures of the flyer itself,Negative
singapore-flyer,i really like observation wheels i loved the london eye and the vegas highroller is okay the singapore flyer was definitely on the top of my list and we picked the perfect time to visit there was virtually no line at the ticket office and the staff were really helpful and nice we got on just before sunset and were the only people in the pod aside from a couple of other tourists the view of the bay and the city is really nice especially when you get to watch the sunset along with it we had a really great time and took some fun photos,Positive
singapore-flyer,a little pricey but you certainly get a great view of the city each time i visit singapore i seem to get back here as a plus if you are in town for the f you get a one of a kind view of the starting grid,Positive
singapore-flyer,it mostly gets  stars because of the price tbh when we paid nearly  plus another  for a bottle of wine i anticipated something spectacular we rode the flyer before on a regular flight and was expecting a really great date night for over  total i was not wowed and for that kind of money i expect to be wowed my wine was good so we picked well the view was a  star view pay the regular ticket price and see it at night we were told to wait in the flyer lounge so we did fyi sodas are not included in your  tickets so expect to pay  for those  for a mocktail and  for a cocktail the cheapest wine is  our flight time was   p m and they made sure to tell us  times to use the bathroom as if we could not hold it for an hour because we are clearly  year olds on a road trip at about   we were immediately rushed to the flyer like literally all of a sudden it was ok every one stand up its time to go lets go i was wearing heels so i was not wearing proper attire to run a marathon across the flyer building so as the host ran with the girl in front of us in flats i mosied my way down i do not understand what the rush was because by the time we got down there we waited another  minutes or so then we were rushed suddenly to get in our car on our first rotation we were served some kind of salad with tuna on it and spinach soup i watched the butler pull the bread out of a plastic bag lol this is where the meal went down hill the soup tasted watered down from a can our second rotation the servers quickly hopped on our car to bring aboard our main course and dessert my husband ordered lamb and i got chicken i cannot speak for his because i have never had lamb before but quite honestly the chicken was low grade and not great it was not very hot or even warm in some places it was rubbery in most places i was starting to get pretty tired at this point and the weird music was not helping we were then served dessert which tasted like a dark chocolate cake with raspberry sauce my husband joked that he did not think it came out of a box but really i would not be surprised the whole point of this was to have an excellent meal or i would have just bought a regular ticket and truthfully the meal sucked the views were beautiful and we got to enjoy the comforts of a less crowded car but do not ever do the meal flight please god just take the regular one for your sake,Negative
singapore-flyer,after reading the reviews i had really low expectations which is why i had a pretty decent time you cannot expect too much from this it is pricey at  sgd per person but you are paying for the photo op it only goes one full circle and that takes about   minutes they packed just enough people in one capsule so that just about everyone got a seat one of the girls in our capsule was freaking out because of the heights but it goes so slow that there is nothing to be afraid of and if you sit at the seats in the center you cannot see the bottom,Negative
singapore-flyer,launched in  the singapore flyer has become another icon on the rich waterfront landscape of singapore the flyer is a big observational ferris wheel very similar to the high roller in vegas which incidentally displaced the singapore flyer as the world is tallest ferris wheel if you have already been on an observation ferris wheel before the flyer is not going to give you the thrills what the flyer will give you though is a really good panoramic views of the city i took the ride late in the evening and it was a treat to see the various landmarks of the singapore skyline some of them lit up with pulsing shades of purple and blue you can see the marina bay sands with its swimming pool on top the eerie looking super trees of gardens by the bay colored bulging blobs of the esplanade and the start finish line of the singapore grand prix track as a tourist visiting the city i would recommend taking the flight once to view the skyline the ticket might be a bit pricey s  for a regular trip and s  for one with a cocktail there are some reasonable discounts for children and senior citizens but hey what better way to explore the skyline of the city getting to the singapore flyer like many things in singapore is fairly convenient it is like a  min walk from the promenade metro station if you are not in the mood for public transport there are always plenty of taxis milling about unlike the vegas high roller the ride itself is a silent one no funny video clips no audio soundtrack explaining how the flyer was built or introduction to famous singapore landmarks which is a bit disappointing for someone who comes to the flyer to learn more about the city as a corollary the flyer acts as a good date spot you can reserve a whole capsule for yourself and wine and dine with your date while the gently moving wheel offers you panoramic vistas,Positive
singapore-flyer,when some out of the country friends came into town one of the things on their list of singapore things to do personally i wanted to do it at night but we ran out of time so we did it on a sunday  something and off we went it was actually really cool i got to see the whole city race track water way all of the above in one swoop def recommended for out of town guests my friends loved it,Positive
singapore-flyer,really great experience i do not recommend taking young kids on the flyer as it is rather slow and the view stays relatively the same throughout the journey before you get in the capsule there is a pre boarding exhibit that shows you the parts of the wheel how it was built and its history it was kind of neat like the interactive displays you would have while waiting in the line for a ride at disney the capsules are very large and they do not try to uncomfortably squeeze a lot of people into one because there are plenty of capsules to go around unfortunately there was a very antsy and impatient child in my capsule who was just yelling and running around and begging to get out the entire time so going back to my first warning do not bring small energetic kids in the flyer we went at an ideal time getting into the capsule at about   pm on the way up it was still light enough to take pictures and on the way down we could see the city begin to light up as the sky grew dark i took a time lapse video using that feature on the iphone  and i cannot stop watching it again and again  minutes of filming turned into a  second video it is incredible to see the sky grow dark but the marina bay grow alive my only complaint is the price while the experience was great it is wayyyyy overpriced  crazy if you ask me it really should only be  tops if you do not want to spend that kind of money you can always go to the sands skypark or go to other attractions like gardens by the bay absolutely incredible or the natural history museum also very impressive the highly underrated national museum of singapore is also very much worth a visit,Negative
singapore-flyer,i recommend the flyer for visitors who would like to see the best views of singapore all at once it was not overly touristy compared to other sights i have visited around the world where the gimmicks and merchandise distract from the main attraction i am glad we had a ride but once is enough however i have travelled singapore more times than i can count so i am sure there would be more awe and wonder for first time visitors especially at night time,Positive
singapore-flyer,this attraction is a bit pricey and probably not worth the money although the city lights are beautiful you can probably get a better view from the sky park at marina bay sands,Negative
singapore-flyer,very clean and accessible and free via thr singapore airlines stopover pkg ride gives you  degrees view of city wished there was a commentary or illustrations inside the car so that we would know what we were seeing easier had to constantly consult and flip the map clean bathrooms nice staff food trail on the ground floor i had some shaved ice mix to counter the heat,Positive
singapore-flyer,surprisingly not busy when we arrived we received a discount by showing our singapore airlines boarding passes we received our own capsule and enjoyed the quite ride with views of the city we went during the day but i would recommend going at night or sunset for more impressive views,Positive
singapore-flyer,holy crap this thing is expensive two adult and  child family deal for only  sg is that a deal this thing self claims to be the biggest in asia it used to be the biggest in the world until a few months ago when vegas beat it by  feet by putting up a  foot tall ferris wheel sg you held the record for  years though good on you what else can you expect at the shopping center at the bottom of the singapore flyer restaurants minimal shopping a  eleven flight experience and a little koi pond where you can sink  sg coins into a fish pellet dispenser,Positive
singapore-flyer,brought a friend from nyc here on a friday night queue time was alright though there was too much of an interference from the staff and annoying tourist festivities like photobooth pictures and a long row of exhibitions before actually getting to the ride in hindsight a pretty smart idea to keep people entertained and getting the most for their  ride and to buy time for the queue and when we got into the ride it was alright a really good view of the ever changing marina bay marina south construction and the skyline of the cbd but a  minute ride is too long even the tourists were bored after the first  but nonetheless a pretty good once in a lifetime experience just to say you would done it and strike it off your list,Positive
singapore-flyer,we checked out the singapore flyer as part of the f grand prix race pass that we got and we arrived  minutes before closing so there was only   people waiting in line i do not really quite understand the sudden world fascination with giant ferris wheels london orlando etc but since it was included we gave it a try at night it does offer some spectacular views of singapore if you plan to take pictures inside of the pod at night might make it a little tricky for a good picture to develop without a really good lens and maybe a tripod though the whole ride lasted about  minutes and maybe something nice to do if you are vacationing with kids,Positive
singapore-flyer,a great time and a recommended time to be shared with people you love even though i am very terrified of heights the flyer moved enough for me to actually enjoy it the  degree views are amazing and some of the best in the city on a clear day like the one that we chose to go on it you can see quite far into the horizon and can take some pretty pictures of the skyline and the gardens by the bay the ride was quick and there were easily accessible amenities for use before or after riding bathroom quick bites etc also downstairs is the fish spa which i will want to try next time in the lion city relaxing with memorable views,Positive
singapore-flyer,as a tourist this was a good ride for a beautiful view of singapore the ride was not fast so you are able to enjoy the beauty of the country either day or night time definitely worth a visit if you are visiting singapore for the first time,Positive
singapore-flyer,do i want to pay  bucks for a twenty minute ride in a giant ferris wheel no way but as a student i get to go in for fifteen but still i have never actually rode the flyer it just seems so pointless to me maybe someday i will actually try it out but i will need a really good reason to do so that said there is no other place for tourists who want to get a good bird is eye view of singapore to go on special occasions such as valentine is day there are also special packages such as classy meals in the capsules but i do visit the place occasionally for the restaurants at the first level such as o learys bar grill which serves up good food and beer,Positive
singapore-flyer,although i have been to the singapore flyer a couple of times i always find it a little inconvenient since the circle line opened the nearest station is the promenade station even so you will have to walk quite a bit under the sun that aside the flyer stands at m and is the world is largest giant observation wheel a half hour ride will cost an adult   at mid point that is where you can enjoy the panoramic view of the singapore skyline as well as bits of neighbouring countries indonesia and malaysia before you know it you would have finished the ride the  minute actually seemed a little short however this is not a place i would visit often because there are not any exciting happenings or new addition it is just a plain ride on the observation wheel it would be special though if you have to luxury to splurge on holding an event or a romantic dinner on the wheel,Positive
singapore-flyer,enamoured by all types of ferris wheels i was elated when i found out about the singapore flyer we bought the basic tickets thirty minutes for   sgd perhaps i was having high expectations but i would really save my money and skip out on this we went on one of the last rides that day so there were not too many people in our cabin the wheel moves very slowly and there is a bench in the middle of the cabin for seating there is a nice view overlooking the marina but there are these neon lights surrounding the cabin which makes it really hard to take any photos  minutes in the flyer is a bit too long i had wanted to get off after  minutes it is a good experience but i do not think it is really worth the     the yelp  challenge,Negative
singapore-flyer,i do not know why so many people rated this so low wth i loved it we packed this in on our last day of vacay before we headed to the hotel to check out it was not very crowded only us and  other couples in our own car during the ride we came right before sunset so we were able to see singapore at dusk and just beginning to light up it was spectacular i have a serious fear of heights and i still felt very secure and enjoyed it  minutes went by very quickly with us snapping photos ooohing and ahhhing it was worth every penny and i would recommend it to everyone i am so thrilled we did not skip it based on the reviews we read here once in a lifetime experience,Positive
singapore-flyer,it is aimed more as a tourist trap but being tourists we let ourselves be trapped it is not all that bad we were lucky enough as we arrived pretty late and near closing time that we got a capsule to ourselves try getting that at the london eye which was a bonus it is basically a copycat london eye but bigger it also has the inflated price to boot the f track was lit up when we there and seeing the outline was pretty cool beyond that it is a nice touristy thing to do,Positive
singapore-flyer,for about  us for a   hour ride all in all pretty fun the ride was clean and the exhibit you walk through before going on the wheel was pretty interesting one thing i could not believe was getting on the ride there is no fence whatsoever along the edge when boarding while there is a net about  feet down the net does not look like it would hold much weight while we were in line a small child maybe  years old ran ahead of his parents and almost fell off the edge the employees did not see it and we had to grab the kid fun area and ride overall though probably just a one time thing though so probably would not do it again if i am ever back in singapore,Negative
singapore-flyer,one of the most iconic structures to be built to our singapore skyline it is no doubt eye catching when you see it along the ecp highway driving across town i have been on the flyer twice though and it is really very underwhelming basically it is  minutes of being in a capsule room with other people if you are lucky they will be well behaved good luck if you chance upon really excited or loud passengers the view above is good but you can see that from marina bay sands still there are some photos to take both times i do not have to pay which is good as well as i do not think the price is justified with the experience also do remember to go to the washroom before you never know if there is going to be another incidence where the flyer gets stuck in operation for  hours the only cool thing at the flyer now is the singapore heritage food trail that is a food court with really vintage items and famous hawker food stalls selling local food do check that out for some food to get a better feel of our heritage and cuisine,Positive
singapore-flyer,a must do in singapore the slow rotation of the enclosed cars on this huge ferris wheel offer great views of the harbor skyline marina bay sands and gardens by the bay the large pods unfortunately fit a fairly large group so you may be sharing with loud children the windows on the pods also make night photography a bit difficult as they tend to be a bit finger print covered still a great way to see the city from on high,Positive
singapore-flyer,while it is one of the most iconic structures the singapore flyer ranks in at a straight zero for me why because paying  to go on a min journey up to see the singapore skyline is a waste of money when there are so many other places you can go to get better views and do more stuff unless they somehow manage to spice up the journey it is going to be a white and very embarrasing elephant for singapore,Negative
singapore-flyer,giant ferris wheel in s pore we visited on a lazy weekday afternoon at pm and managed to secure our own cabin it is a nice slow ride great views but totally not worth the cost take the money you would spend here and go visit night safari or gardens by the bay instead,Positive
singapore-flyer,i have got a fantastic idea to jazz up the singapore flyer especially since they are having an upcoming halloween fest to scare people outside the flyer they should plan a ghost inside each cabin who sits quietly in a corner then as participants enter the cabin and the door closes behind them the flyer moves and the cabin goes up and graarrwww the ghost comes alive i know it is very scary anyways i went into up the flyer when it was a gloomy day probably that was why the entire experience was a little let down the ang mo tourists next to us stopped taking pictures and were yawning within two minutes while the pinoy tourists rested their feet at the seats in the middle it was terribly un exciting or maybe it is because i was not attracted by the scenery the little exhibition tour before the flyer was slightly more interesting the flyer looks beautiful from afar but to step inside nah no thanks,Negative
singapore-flyer,it is big it is new ish it is the world is biggest ferris wheel needless to say since singapore is flat as a pancake and the skyline from here is dominated by skyscrapers that is mainly what you will be looking at if that is your thing great,Positive
singapore-flyer,i came here once with a friend for a ride and it was pretty cool i have not been on the london eye yet so to experience the singapore sky scape was quite a thrill the structure itself looks pretty fun with different lights flashing during different times of the day and when you look at the view during sunset it is really kinda breathtaking what i love when i took the ride it was before the resorts were built and the experience was nice it was windy was not too crowded and commercial the structure itself has a mall underneath so you can have a meal there and do a little shopping once you are done what i do not love getting there oh gosh i remember trying to get there was such a pain it really was a nightmare i think they really should make the walk to get there more user friendly perhaps a shuttle it was quite a pain as i arrived a sticky mess urgh,Positive
singapore-flyer,this to me is another over rated place in the country and it is not for those with a fear of heights mom won free tickets when it first opened so i came here with my family we got to take a photo before getting into our capsule but chose not to buy it while the  minute ride permitted us to have a  degree bird eye is view of the city skyline and take pictures i did not find this experience particularly exciting i would perhaps feel otherwise if i was here for a special occasion yeah i suppose it would be magical to exchange vows with the sun setting or the cbd lights twinkling in the backdrop or catch the fireworks during the national day parade but i did not have a memorable time here we were fortunate enough to have gotten free tickets i would not have paid  for this  minute ride,Negative
singapore-flyer,i have been to the flyer a couple of times and its great if you wanna catch a glimpse of the singapore skyline for   for one adult you get a half hour ride on the flyer the last time i was there was quite a while ago and the marina area was very much still under construction i am pretty sure the view is much nicer these days i would say if you want to get the best view go either in the late afternoon evening from  to  and hopefully catch golden hour or take a night ride and of course there are a number of food outlets in the premises if you find yourself hungry after the ride,Positive
singapore-flyer,a bit pricey for a  minute ride went up with my family and friends and the view was pretty nice as the sun was going down at the same time though not a good place for kids because most do not know how to appreciate it do not buy the pictures thinking we buy  for the price of sgd   and would get a folder for each but no they only gave one folder for one picture if we want one extra we have to pay   each sucked suggested place river safari at the singapore zoo,Negative
singapore-flyer,it was amazing and it takes a whole hour to get around but who cares there is lots of room in the capsule and they take a picture and you get to buy  digital picture along with a real one,Positive
singapore-flyer,i have to say if you compare this to things like the london eye you will be disappointed views are not captivating instead you can see every building site currently planned for singapore however having said that its a comfortable and pleasant experience the pods are large and not too many people are in each one infact it was very quiet when we visited the rotation took around  minutes and by the end of it we were limited on what to look at the area around the wheel has a few facilities but better to walk over to the new marina bay area,Negative
singapore-flyer,in my honest opinion the singapore flyer is an exciting attraction but when you are there already the hype dies down the view was superb from up there but to be honest you can see almost the same from your hotel window but if you are a tourist and you really want to visit an icon try the singapore flyer,Negative
singapore-flyer,being singapore meant that i definitely had to check out the flyer despite knowing that it was just another touristy spot in singapore they seem to still have the student promotion going on where its half price if you can produce any student card on a weekday otherwise it is a tad pricey to be going without any rhyme or reason but aside from the price it was a great and unique experience since there is not any other similar attraction like this in singapore we went in the night time so the city skyline was a great view to enjoy but if you are afraid of heights like me you might find yourself rooted to the spot trying to take pictures the good thing is there is a small bench in the middle of each capsule in case you are feeling dizzy from the height or just want to rest your legs the mounting platform is fairly simple with the capsules continuously rotating so you sort of have to do a running hop on to the ledge but it moves at a really slow speed so just something to look out for,Positive
singapore-flyer,not now the view is horrible with the construction of the casinos nearby wait a few more years when the casino sites are finished then it will be a grand site,Negative
singapore-flyer,enjoy the skyline of singapore just like in london in london we call it the eye in singapore they call it the flyer situated right my the f street circuit the singapore provides a view of singapore like no other look to the south on a clear day you may even see some of the islands off indonesia the flyer is near the marian square shopping centre best way to get there is off the mrt at city hall and walk try and make the most of it by taking a riding on a clear sunny day or during the evening when it is not raining,Positive
singapore-flyer,sad to say i have not heard great comments about this one the one hour ride is too long and as mentioned the view right now will be of construction of the marina integrated resorts if i had to go i would choose to go about   pm catching the sunset as day changes into night,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,my hostess andrea was very professional and provided superior customer service although the wait was a little long she always checked in with us to make sure our needs were met we will definitely come back and appreciate her pleasant attitude and professional demeanor keep up the excellent standards,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,my favorite bistro oyster bar in singapore excellent service and delicious food not as pricey as lavo located inside marina bay sands resort i had brunch here on saturday and also was honored to meet chef jonathan despite his busy schedule during service all of the staff were so attentive and friendly it made us feel like we were getting a red carpet treatment even though it was just a regular day for the workers there we had an oyster platter db original burger squid ink pasta brussel sprouts mushrooms also some champagne and mixed drinks that were not on the menu they have an excellent wine list and dessert menu i also had some freshly made madeleines molten chocolate cake and baked alaskan for dessert i made an early reservation for brunch at am it was not that crowded but after my oysters came it started to get busy we had rain serving us ace was the bartender balthazar was the gm as well as olivia and everyone else working i will have to say that this place has unsurpassed service and excellent food shall definitely be back it is one of the busier and best places to eat in marina bay sands,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,this place is conveniently located inside a huge shopping mall it has a three consecutive brunch selection that is modestly priced the food and customer service here was excellent i definitely recommend it,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,service is good we arrived aft pm for supper staff were good to let us sit in as they close around pm i think like the shrimp cocktail escargots broccoli brussel sprouts were a little hard to chew overall the food service are good,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,love love love it first of all the service fantastic every friggin person at db bistro was on point the bartender the hostess the server bringing my food the manager all of them were friendly chatty pro active and helpful take note all other restaurants this is how it should be i have noticed that often restaurants serve subpar dishes during restaurant week not db bistro the dishes were also listed on their regular menu and were just great i have said it before and i will say it again simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication i love innovation but a classic is often a classic for a reason and when it is executed well it is hard to beat i started with the kale caesar salad i will definitely be back for this it was one of the best salads i had in singapore the dressing was in perfect ratio to the salad and the anchovies gave it that typical caesar flavor the slow cooked salmon showed great skill in my opinion it was cooked just right the dessert was another hit the molten chocolate cake with the salted caramel sauce was pure indulgence and this is not where the praise stops the cocktail recommended by the bartender was simply amazing i guess the only negative thing i can say about db bistro is that i ate way too much and that this experience spoiled many other restaurants for me as it will be hard to find somewhere in singapore which matches the service and food of db bistro in short awesome food awesome service they will see me back at db bistro,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,after a show at the theatre we decided dinner was in order first time at the bistro the burgers are really good juicy and flavorful will definitely come back,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,really wanted to like this place better the boulud name raised my expectations so it could only disappoint from there which it unfortunately did whilst service was prompt and ninja like and ambience was very nice the all important food was a major let down especially considering we ordered the signature dish we had a db burger and salmon tartare to share as we had only eaten brunch mins before the db burger was ordered medium but came out very pink the foie gras inside was barely noticeable and made zero impact or difference to the burger whilst the texture of the burger was good it was woefully under seasoned and thus lacked any flavour more salt would have probably helped bring out the flavour of the quality beef a few miserable slivers of onion for  a burger could not they have at least caramelised them and lettuce were scattered inside along with a smear of mustard and ketchup the parmesan bun was also totally underwhelming  is massively overpriced for a burger that would have been beaten in a blind taste test by shake shack or omakase on the plus side the chips french fries were excellent salmon tartare was very small and not at all worth the  portion essentially what you would get if it was served in a martini glass again under seasoned and lacking any real character even the bread basket they served us was disappointing with bread that had the texture of being cut and out in the air for a few hours overall for what was essentially a meal for one we paid  and did not even order a drink do not be sucked in by the celebrity name the food is far from what the price tag leads you to expect,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,i am a big fan of daniel boulud is restaurants i have been to almost all of his nyc restaurants and i have been to the bar boulud in london as well so i was excited to see a db bistro moderne in singapore i came here on a busy saturday night and sat at the bar the staff was friendly and welcoming and i quickly had a cocktail and some bread in front of me i ordered the steak frites usually steak frites is a mid grade hanger or skirt steak at db it is usda prime imported from the usa so it is the top quality beef you can get the dish was served with frites and a mini wedge salad the steak was a bit undercooked but they quickly took it back and brought it up to where i wanted it temperature wise after all was corrected with the steak i went on to enjoy the entire plate of food although a bit on the pricey side it was an excellent dining experience,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,over the past couple of year i have been to db bistro  or  times and it is become one of my favorite places in sg even though it is in a mall the menu is french american with some classics lots of seafood and burgers perhaps one of their most famous dish is the original db burger which is made from short ribs and foie gras it sounds totally decadent and at  it is the most expensive burger i have had in my life but the short rib foie gras combo was not working for me even though i love both separately a better choice is the yankee burger which is exactly what a great burger should be like the other famous item is their seafood tower available in  sizes we had the medium one which was basically good enough as a dinner for  people loved the lobster and oysters and speaking of which the oysters here are the best that i have had in singapore very fresh full of briny juice and a nice selection of both european and north american oysters the surprise hit for me was their steak i had the ny strip and it was a better steak than most of the steak houses in singapore ok at  it is not that cheap but it was perfectly cooked and very flavorful and tender would definitely order a steak again overall it is a great place for some oysters and drinks as well as a full dinner seafood or steaks or burgers,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,on sunday we had a quick pre theater lunch at db bistro moderne it is an elegant and comfortable dining room not liking the looks of the appetizer choices and not wanting dessert we passed over the set brunch items and focused on the ala carte side of the menu for a starter we shared the large portion of tuna tartar  served with cucumber mint yogurt and thin homemade chickpea crackers the dish suffered from a spiciness and strong dressing that sadly overpowered the tuna i have had this same sort of dish elsewhere and most places let the fresh tuna flavor take center stage luke is does an especially nice version using avocado the chickpea crackers were not doing the trick so we asked for more of the complimentary sliced baguette bread to use in its place for mains we chose burgers i had the yankee burger with cheddar cheese and my friend chose the frenchie burger the presentation of the tall burger and the condiments is really nice see photo the sirloin lacked enough seasoning to enhance the natural flavors of the high quality beef my friend had the same complaint although i requested medium well my burger was served at medium still very pink in side i am always a little underwhelmed with the burgers here on my last visit i had the original db burger and remember having the same issues with it the good the dining room is elegant and comfortable the staff is friendly the bad tuna tartar needs less seasoning burgers need more seasoning the verdict i am looking forward to returning again and exploring more of the menu   stars,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,first let me say that this is a reluctant four i would rather it be a three but the service and food were both of good quality party of two saturday night made the day prior the decor is understated elegance comfortable attractive the tables are nicely spaced and the booths looked comfortable unfortunately we were seated at a table that was directly in line with the traffic from the kitchen to the dishing room so it was bit uncomfortable we has the steak tartare frenchie burger original db burger fries and for dessert durian souffl and maccarons the food quality was good as expected for the price it was not as exceptional as expected the tartare was good but i have had better the fries we under seasoned the burgers were delicious and the portion was small we shared everything and originally started with the frenchie thinking it would be filling the portion was small so we ordered the db burger the patty was larger after all it is stuffed with short ribs and foie gras two things pushed this from a three to a four service server mira was outstanding and attentive kudos to the restaurant for having quality servers and kudos to mira for caring dessert the durian souffl was over the top delicious durian is such an odd fruit and forbidden in many places for the smell so i was surprised to see it on the menu mira and i had a brief conversation about how they actually use real durian and the controversy around that th maccarons were also very good and surprisingly affordable  small for s  the best of course were the madelines served after the meal these were heaven light fluffy lemony warm dusted with powdered sugar all in all a good experience but with so many choices for dining in singapore i doubt that i will return to this particular venue,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,if you have never heard of daniel boulad you need to get your head out of your ass seriously he is amazing and db bistro certainly lives up to having his name on the place when i first moved to singapore i wanted to take myself out to a nice place after my i closed my first deal at work and knew there were some celebrity restaurants in the mbs being that i was flying solo for this dinner i knew i wanted somewhere that i would feel comfortable sitting at the bar alone and somewhere that had killer cocktails and amazing food db had it all i was immediately sat at the bar the bartender i wish i could remember his name was chatty but not annoying and made his recommendations and the service was excellent i had the lychee martini some killer oysters the salmon and the molten chocolate cake everything was excellent since then i have been back about  times i take clients there i took my friends who were visiting from the us and have gone back on my own each time the bartender remembers me and my name and always makes a point to say hello which i think is a nice touch i have had everything from their lobster to the steak to the pasta and everything is good if you are looking for a special occasion place date night client dinner or lunch or place to sit at the bar and enjoy some me time db bistro is the place to be p s do not skimp on the bread it is delicious,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,now i came here really wanting to love this place and i loved some of the food but it did definitely fall short of expectations first let me say that the service here is excellent definitely the best i experienced in singapore and i sat at the bar i ordered a burger and french onion soup to start the french onion soup was very good though quite pricey but definitely the best french onion soup i ever had unfortunately though that was not what i really wanted i came here for the burger and the reason db bistro moderne is only getting three stars instead of four or five the burger had quite a burnt tast and i ordered medium the beef did not seem to be of a high quality which is disappointing as i am sure they spent a pretty penny on it the bun was soaked and surprisingly depressing if only they knew how to keep the bun dry i ordered the yankee burger and really do not have anything positive to say about it i would take a carl is jr six dollar burger over this any day of the week and it is a third of the price i really want to try this place again since the french onion soup was so good and the bartender hooked me up with free madeleine is which were fresh and very buttery next time i am in singapore i will be back here and hopefully i get more of the french onion soup awesome madeleines and great service and less of the horribly overrated disgusting burger,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,this is a review of a dinner date at db bistro moderne in the shoppes at marina bay sands the ambiance is modern with touches of the classic i do like the kitchen behind the frosted glass it is a nice comfortable room i think its great that the tables are not so very close together tinyurl com cssjthe service was extremely good they were attentive throughout the meal the staff was friendly polite and professional the food ranged from good to exceptional complimentary bread for me this was the weakest part of the meal there were three kinds of bread but i did not find any of them particularly interesting tinyurl com clhsdsteak tartare cornichons capers parsley baby romaine grilled country bread this was my date is selection for a appetizer i tried it and thought it was very good it was tender and oh so flavourful truth be told while i eat it relatively often steak tartare is not my favourite dish but this was very good as with most of the dishes the presentation was quite nice tinyurl com bppfewdsan daniel prosciutto arugula toasted country bread i selected this dish as my starter this was truly excellent prosciutto this is living proof that great food starts with great ingredients so simple yet so wonderful tinyurl com cxpptrhthe frenchie burger beef patty topped with confit pork belly caramelized onion morbier cheese arugula cornichons served on a black pepper bun i selected db moderne so that i could try their burger i could not order their signature burger i no longer eat foie gras i selected the frenchie burger this was the best burger i have eaten in singapore it surpassed the burger at omakase but this really gets into the debate between diner style burgers and gourmet burgers i think the frenchie was smaller than i expected but the ingredients were amazing and came together so well it was cooked to a perfect medium rare this allowed the flavour of the beef to shine through the morbier cheese is what took it over the top it was such a great selection i loved it the fries were good but certainly not amazing tinyurl com bnemgtkduck confit savoy cabbage olive oil crushed potatoes mustard jus my date selected the duck confit this was not a surprise i tried it and it was quite good she really enjoyed in tinyurl com cyrvyodessert for dessert she ordered the profiteroles and i ordered the chocolate fondant i tried both they were both chocolate lovers dreams however i preferred my chocolate fondant it was just an explosion of chocolate tinyurl com cdzyrqtinyurl com cgvyznsinister americano this was her cocktail i tried it it reminded me of fireball whiskey this means i liked it but i am not sure how for me it would pair with food tinyurl com dxngbwreceipt dinner for   tinyurl com bnjftoverall db bistro moderne provided all of the elements of a great meal food ambiance and service the burger would rate with almost any in the world however i think if they are going to do it why not go all the way and make the burger of a more reasonable size for dinner the remainder of the food was also enjoyable it just made for a pleasant dining experience,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,i ended up at db bistro oyster bar by sheer happenstance came out to marina bay sands for the sg food festival the event was packed seemed to capacity and soooo very hot i lasted all of  minutes outside before i called it quits and decided to enter the mbs mall of course the mall was packed too decided on french food for lunch got in the queue for db bistro and after a ten minute wait we were in looking over the menu i realized i was duh in a daniel boulud restaurant oh db score lovely dining room much more elegant and modern than a french bistro but not stuffy another positive although the restaurant was full i was able to hold a conversation with my table mate with no problem the staff was very efficient our server very helpful for such a busy day our food came out rather quickly that was a nice surprise i started off with a db signature bloody mary it is a meal the drink included a skewer of prawn ham pickled veggies and a the all important stalk of celery to go with the bloody mary i ordered french fries with three dipping sauces yum and a lovely chilled lobster salad taste was meh i should of stopped at the drink and fries because the salad was really boring the person i was dining with ordered the new england casserole and he really enjoyed every bite the casserole was loaded with mussels clams shrimp fennel sausage and corn and it came with two generous chunks of toasted garlic bread so a score there three and a half stars all in all just an okay experience i know i know it is a daniel boulud restaurant but i am pretty sure he was nowhere in sight this sunday afternoon other than a celebrity chef name and prices to match there is nothing to compel me to return to this restaurant at this price range there are many more restaurants i would rather visit upon my return to the mbs mall,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,for the price this should have rocked the casbah db as they call it has a nice menu and serve a great duck another good place to get someone else to pay and buy some nice wines if you cannot leave mbs had the lamb and duck confit the duck was awesome with succulent crispy skin and fall off the bone meat served on a bed of garbanzo beans with bacon this was five star worthy the lamb was cooked medium and pretty good served with mint and a nice burre rouge wine is pricey but service is excellent,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,four stars for the food everything was delicious the salad was a little too salty but when we mentioned it it was replaced without questions two stars for service and ambiance very slow service we sat at the bar the only people on one side for  min before we got a glass of wine checked in an hour early for a dinner reservation and was told there would be a table in  min it took almost an hour ordered a bottle of wine that the sommelier  min later told us they didnt have asked for  min to make a new decision he didnt come back although we tried to wave him down several times finally got a bottle and had a glass but most of it we had to pour ourselves in regards to the ambience if you like to pay  for a mean for two with a view to people walking in the shopping mall it may work for you not exactly what i had in mind for a valentines day dinner with my lady,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,it is a great deal having this french dinner at sands the restaurant is owned by a three star michelin chef which i just found out it is a chic restaurant with a choice of french or nyc,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,an incredible burger and service to match i emailed them about a reservation in the morning got a confimation within an hour who needs opentable flashy but without comfort someone let db down on this decore design all hard surface the noise was deafing had this been designed for a concert hall it might have worked the conversation of the loud chinese  something girl could be heard easily from the bar to the shopping center the pink floyd cocktail while pretty was all ice and foam and the tartie mine alsacian was a  large cheese craker but oh the db burger was  very well spent just perfect thanks db dessert the apple mille feuille was way over thunk the sorbet saved the plate from complete disaseter,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,after lunch at pita pan i hopped over to db bistro where i had visited three times previously for their revamped menu this place has always been one of my favourite dessert spots in singapore and it still is if you are thinking that the desserts here are over priced or belong to the atas petite sized kinds that are gone in less than  big mouthfuls then you might be interested to pop by here to have a look out from the menu is the old apricot vanilla souffle the new angmoh pastry chef benjamin siwek has gone local to come up with this royale durian souffl  this is by far a souffl with the most character the fluffy mixture seems insubstantial as one digs a spoon in but the flavour fills up the mouth just like hd surround sound system echoing in every space the queen fruit mangosteen was turned into a sorbet to accompany the durian but i was too busy with the souffl the peculiar thing is that the chocolate dessert here did not make a show the milk chocolate mousse with peanut brittle and banana ice cream  did not have multiple textures even though it sounds crunchy the base sat a rather dry brownie like cake layer which did not help to score points another southeast asian inspired dessert was the jackfruit verrine  which caused everyone is face to cringe with an extremely sour lime sherbet but once you mixed it with the coconut tapioca and palm sugar it all went down sweetly this was another satisfying experience and i am looking forward to the new items for the next season and last but not least i am grateful for the complimentary treat of db is or aka da bomb madeleines which are still as light as those on my previous visit they might be rustic bakes but once you try these it will be difficult to find a better one,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,the funny thing is the db bistro in singapore was not as good as the one in nyc we ordered the same things that we ordered in nyc their famous burger and duck confit and a few starters in nyc the food was amazing and we loved what we ordered but here we both did not think the food was as good and at the end of the meal we just felt full with not a satisfying feeling we just felt we ate too much and wanted to puke overall it is a overpriced restaurant that i would not go back because of the taste i would go back in nyc overall verdict taste amount price atmosphere,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,i went to db bistro moderne a few times and to be honest was not wow ed by the food here it was not bad and i certainly did not regret going but none of the dishes really stood out one of their signature dishes here is obviously the famous burger i tried the original db burger and it was good i loved the unique combination of regular beef burger patty foie gras and braised ribs if i remember correctly it was very creative and i do not think you can have it anywhere else in the world but the bread bun was disappointing it really was a huge distraction from that wonderful patty the other dishes were ok i suppose tried the casserole snail chicken fricassee some fishes and they were all good we also had the kagoshima beef and it was very good very simply done but then again it is much harder to screw up such a wonderful piece of meat than to do it right all in all i definitely wo not mind going here again if my friends or family want to but there are a lot better of restaurants in singapore,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,delicious food but very pricey given the portions cheapest beer is  sgd wanted to like this place more than i did durian souffl was absolutely terrific but likely wo not be returning soon due to the overpriced menu,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,went to dinner here with a group of friends  of us total the service was mediocre somewhat slow and a number of mis steps such as bringing food to the wrong person letting water glasses go empty and timing the food was all good but nothing that made us go wow portions are generous the best thing we ordered was the seafood tower everything was very fresh and tasty would i go back probably am i excited to go back no,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,it is been three years since my wife and i officially moved to singapore this date only came to our attention while we already sitting in the db bistro moderne we could not have chosen a better place to celebrate after a long thirsty afternoon walking around the city we ended up at mbs it is hard to select a place to eat in this are due to all of the many and high end gourmet restaurants in the shoppes at marina bay sands but we checked a couple of reviews on yelp and decided that db was the place of choice we got a table without a reservation without a problem ordered two iceberg lettuce salads a db burger and some french onion soup drinks were a brewerkz pale ale and a mint lime and ginger lemonade the service was very good it was very friendly and a casual glance at our fellow diners indicated people were really enjoying themselves the bread they brought out before the salad was great but then the salads arrived wow the lettuce was very fresh crunchy and not too big being a confirmed carnivore i tolerate salads just the blue cheese dressing with bacon bits added had great flavors and before we knew it they were gone my wife was not as hungry as i was so she ordered the french onion soup it arrived complete with the gruyere cheese melted and floating on the top taste was wonderful my db burger was stuffed with short ribs and foie gras i had never tasted foie gras before and despite some countries banning it i decided to give it a try the burger was cooked to perfection medium just like i had ordered the short ribs and foie gras were spectacular the french fries tasty with a portion size that was the right side of not too big washed down with the pale ale from brewerkz it really did hit the spot can you say that a  burger is good value maybe not but the taste was truly exceptional we let the food settle and followed it with some excellent coffee it was a great experience here,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,db bistro is hailed as the place to go to for the best burger in singapore even by fellow chefs with a testimonial like that it is hard for us burger fans to resist we loved the gougres with grated gruyre cheese and basque pepper piment d espelette it was so addictive we could have eaten a dozen of them easily the bread platter had a good selection of different types of bread we had the foie gras terrine with quince it was a bit too rich and heavy for me but otherwise smooth and creamy i had the steak frites which came as a nicely pink and juicy sirloin but personally i prefer the fattier ribeye cut the fries were pretty awesome though friend had the burger but was very much unimpressed unfortunately verdict i just want more of those gorgeous gougres,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,this is an expensive french restaurant in a mall they do everything very well but i think there is still a sense that you are paying a  markup for daniel boulud is name the wine list is insane both in how expensive and long it is the bread they serve with dinner and the potatoes au gratin were very good the coq au vin was decent the spanish dish had too much going on the service was great it was my mother is favorite meal in singapore but i cannot really see myself going back i prefer the french stall tfs bistrot and saveur,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,been here for to celebrate a few occasion and db is one of the few decent celebrity chef restaurants here in singapore i recommend getting the oysters as it is always fresh and not too expensive their duck confit is pretty good and the db burger is really a must try the steaks are average so i would not recommend splurging on that we went there for a date on valentine is day and wrote a feedback to the management that the overall experience was good but the service can be improved the table next to us had plates sitting in for  minutes after the couple that occupied the table left the staff could have cleared it immediately as it was not that busy the manager responded to me via email thanking me for the feedback and was told to book with him directly for future reservations compared to other celebrity chef restaurants here in singapore db is one of the few worth splurging on,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,chef daniel boulud better known as daniel has opened his first southeast asia restaurant db bistro moderne at marina bay sands mbs early last year i am not counting his beijing outlet since china sits in east asia than in our sea region at  he is a well established celebrity chef who owns many high rating restaurants in the west born in france and culinary trained by notable french chefs he emerged as a rising star marked with many awards his fame continue to rise after his ny restaurant daniel receives the most prestigious rating and becomes michelin  star restaurant daniel is well known for his traditional french cooking with a touch of modern american flavor this speaks well for the attention he receives in new york he clearly understood what appeals and suits the americans with a twist the restaurant is located at basement  of marina bay sands a luxurious integrated resort with a world class casino and famous sands skypark it is easily accessible by public transports where the most convenient way of getting there by mass rapid transit mrt alighting at bayfront station one should spot the restaurant effortlessly as it lies just opposite grand theater is ticketing counter arriving at ish in the afternoon the restaurant was only  filled with diners probably due to brunch hours with my reservation i was being ushered politely to a leathery rosso dining banquette the bistro looks elegant dressed up in stylish hanging globes across the ceiling to me it was all sexy and chic and thanks to jeffrey beers the architect and interior designer the ambiance was laid back but not on the service the main courses were served in mins after they have been placed first came the coq au vin braised chicken cooked with wine wild mushrooms pearl onions few stripes of pork belly and most notable lardons the spetzle a form of egg noodles but small button shaped was served alongside in a iron cast dishware the dish looks attempting and it gives off an exhilarating winy aroma i immediately helped myself with the chicken thigh it came with  drumsticks and a thigh and it was all comforting the thigh was well soaked with the thickened wine juices leaving the skin jelly liked however the meat was a bit tough and chewy unfortunately the drumsticks taste similar i would believe it should not have happened on drumsticks i am puzzled over the meat texture even until now on the brighter side the thickened gravy was heavenly and you ought to drizzle it over those spetzle to enjoy it must not be wasted the pearl onions were sweet so fresh that they were all crunchy at each bite the barely noticeable stripped pork belly and cubed mushrooms were thoroughly braised and yummy i smiled at those lardon bits that made the dish taste even better just like seeing a plate of char kway teow sprinkled generously with lardons full of guilt but gratifying while feeling a little upset over the chicken meat i am so delighted that i am right about fried eggs lyonnaises the not so popular egg dish was a surprise i am amazed that the duck confit was so well done that it was so soft and delicate the fact that the duck meat was even tender than coq au vin is chicken drumsticks makes me felt worst over it and the caramelized onions add an extra sweetness to the meat it was not gamey at all the cubed potatoes embedded underneath the layer of cheese were equally delicious not to be missed db is desserts i have a soft spot for desserts and their warm madeleines were to die for the  petit cakes wrapped in linen for warmth appeared ballooning and lip smacking each was light and spongy the center was air filled with a pronounced lemony taste it was delectable on its own even without the capped icing dust it was definitely a highlight on the dessert menu i confessed being gluttony i could not stop at only  dessert i would to have another when some new flavors caught my eyes i decided on something more a scoop of cherry blossom ice cream and another honey buttermilk sorbet the cherry blossom ice cream was pretty looking bright and pinky it has a tangy taste but nothing flowery i figured it was more of a cherry flavor while naming it blossom to make it sound beautiful on the other hand the honey buttermilk was nothing more than a sweet milk concoction without great distinction in all i am satisfied with db bistro moderne the  bill is worth trying out a michelin  star is cousin after all thanks to the alsatian born chef stephane istel who manned the stove at the mbs outlet i had a memorable bistronomic affair altogether,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,decent dessert at this american french import in the marina bay sands mall not a silence inducing sort of impressive but did just manage to hit the spot during a dessert craving i am on a quest to dessert my way through the lauded restaurants in this luxurious mall these restauranters are meant to be at the top of their class and what better way to test their prowess than through my favourite course of a meal and the only reason i sit through the preceding courses it is a nice restaurant bistro like steakhouse is probably the best description with a diligently calculated measure of elegance that i associate with american restaurants we had to get the souffle especially since it was a durian flavored and served with mangosteen sorbet light mildly sweet and eggy i think the heavy pungency was muted to suit their likely foreign clientele it might be a little too mild actually but any more might make you a social pariah post meal the sorbet was nice and subtly flavored i am not sure it was the best combinaton though both the souffle and sorbet had muted profiles that disappeared into an indistinct nothingness when eaten together his internationally lauded madeleines were tiny little things nestled lovingly in a cloth basket and dusted with sugar soft and cakey i thought them a little one dimensional though and a tad too sweet without a cup of tea to wash down it was a generous serving far more than we could or wanted to eat at a single seating so we doggy bagged about half and ordered the hot chocolate fondant a lava cake is so nineties i know but it does not stop me loving it this was a decent rendition i have a suspicion that the innards of the cake are not uncooked cake batter which drops it a couple points in my regard but it was quite chocolatey and served with two scooops of delicious ice cream so decent desserts though i would still pick the wolfgang puck establishment over this the desserts here are a little lighter on the wallet and the portions slightly more generous which makes it a pretty good option if you are in the area,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,we started off with the duck pate it came with a fair amount of garnish and all of the components together with the foie tasted nice but it was pretty typical nothing too out of the ordinary but it was good for mains me and my friend had the famous db burger the first few bites of it were exquisite the flavorful patty stuffed with foie gras and short ribs was fantastic it was juicy well seasoned and incredibly rich the roll was a nice soft bun with just enough structure so it does not fall apart and the lettuce and tomato served there purpose the main problem was as good as those first bites were after about half of the burger the richness becomes overwhelming between myself and a friend we could have split one burger and been content it needed something to cut through the richness the fries were pretty good crispy yet fluffy basically a typical restaurant style fry altogether though  is way too much for a burger i do not think i could justify getting this again the service was good enough though i do feel as the restaurant got a bit busier our table started to get ignored the decor is pretty typical upscale bistro style i would come in again to try other offerings basically the restaurant is pretty good but you are paying a lot for daniel boulud is name,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,went here for lunch and shared the original db burger stuffed with short rib foie gras it was truly one of the best burgers we have ever had the pleasure of consuming did not mind paying  for that burger however the cocktails were way over priced between the two of us we had  drinks and our lunch tab was over  and we shared a single burger it was an indulgent lunch break but not one we would do again hard to justify that kind of cost for a burger lunch,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,we went for the burgers not typical for a fancy fine dining establishment but hey they prominently promote themselves as a gourmet burger destination i had the frenchie burger while my friend had the yankee burger think that is what it was called the issue with their burger was which my friend echoed too was that they seemed to have high quality ingredients but they did not come together well the frenchie for example had a slice of pork belly which particularly did not blend with the rest of the concoction or enhance it any way also never have i had a great burger in a place where they ask you how would you like your patty done a burger patty is not a steak and since the chef has put together the offering the house should go with what they think goes best they can have different burgers for those who like it rare v s those who like it well done or since its a fine dining establishment have the option of accommodating the guest is request if the guest has a very particular way they want their burger a meal with one of their basic burger with fries tad overdone and a soda we had a mint lemonade quite average sets you back by  all inclusive not bad for a fine dining place with pretty good if a little over whelming service,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,really love the steak and frites have tried other dishes like the burger and duck confit which are good as well like the ambience as well classy but casual,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,db drinks are great cheeseburger is awesome im not the fans of their famous foeigras burger n their madeleines dessert is good too,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,when you are craving for a burger in singapore db bistro is the place to go their frenchie burger is so good just by reading the ingredients of that burger on the menu your mouth will already start to water hehehe i asked mine medium rare and it was cooked perfectly it was nice and juicy like a burger should be plus the fries that come with it are delicious too okay now i am having a burger craving again hahahaha,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,my kid was hungry and we stop here not knowing it is one of daniel boulud is restaurant what we got was good but will definitely come back to enjoy a full course dinner without the unmanageable kid,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,causy place onion soup not the same standard you would expect for such fancy place bread is not that tasty lobster salad is ok some how,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,the french onion soup was world class bread basket with two types of bread that were of superior taste grilled salmon was perfectly cooked with crispy skin in a complementing sauce with potatoes vegitables wait staff was warn friendly and attentive only distraction was a woman man that we are running around with a clip board acting as auditors they need to be sent to ukraine front to refocus their purpose for existence price was fare for the quality of the meal,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,had a family dinner here and we all concurred that after covering ample global ground amongst the  of us with extreme appetites for wanderlust db undoubtedly served up the best burger we have had ever the patty was made from what i suspect is rib meat and a delicious silver of foie gras is stuffed in between the juicy patty a must get easily a tenner and on to the others beef tartare was good   oysters good   other places eg pasarbella has much better and a wider selection but hey this isn t a seafood restaurant hummus ok    escargot good but somewhat forgettable   dessert all wonderful except for the durian souffle that was terrible and obviously created by a gweilo for the palate of another foreigner distasteful the service absolutely outstanding there was a malay lady who was absolutely knowledgeable and spot on i think all in all we walked out with a k bill  people free flowing alcohol but so worth it,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,was looking forward to the foie gras burger it was a poorly executed under cooked raw when i asked for medium pink the middle bundle of ground beef short ribs with foie gras stuffed in the middle such a waste of a meal service was lacking as well,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,everything is very tasty they have fresh pear juice great kale salad and original db burger for very hungry,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,started with a bloody mary that was ridiculously too spicy to drink next the flank steak frites which both my husband spit out the quality of the beef was stringy and gross not tender or tasteful plus the bernaise was gummy and looked as if it sat out all morning not reminiscent of my love for steak frites in france my husband ordered the burger with fois gras and short ribs and much like the other reviews here the burger did not come together well the ingredients did not compliment each other in a far to rich flavor unfortunately this is the second experience at db restaurant that was less perfect as we had the same experience at the palm beach fl restaurant short ribs that got spot out in the bush our friends still laugh about how that could happen in a star restaurant,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,i have eaten here three times and service and quality have been excellent everytime recommend the steak frites or even the burger excellent variety of wines and delicious desserts,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,this is a  and half star restaurant for me it reminds me of a typical higher end vegas hotel restaurant the produce is good but the execution falls short the lobster and foie gras and truffle that we had were really of good quality but they were just not cooked as perfectly as they should we started out with the seared foie gras and lobster salad the foie gras was a teeny bit overcooked and slightly underseasoned it was not bad at all but it was not overwhelmingly good for me the lobster salad had a generous portion of chunky lobster meat and the little gem lettuce was really fresh but the french dressing was terrible it tastes completely like thousand island dressing and was way too heavy and creamy for the delicate lettuce and lobster meat which was a shame i had the boulebaisse for my main which is a french seafood stew i really liked the stock because i love lobster bisque and it was rich and tasted like a good lobster bisque with hints of sherry the produce was okay but the fish was very bland my husband got the truffle homemade pasta with aged parmesan we thought it would be a truffle infused pasta but it was normal pasta homemade though with some truffle slices on it the aged parmesan sauce was a tad disappointing and lacks the complexity and deepness of aged parmesan it was an okay cheese sauce but nothing to shout about service was decent and prompt though,Negative
db-bistro-moderne,for appetizers try any of the fresh oysters and the foie gras terrine for the main courses of course you should try the signature burger with foie gras and pork the new orleans casserole with mussels and sausages is also a treat the duck dish prepared in three different ways is a pleasant surprise both the mussels and the duck are dishes good for two and for the dessert my favorite is the profiteroles with a chocolate disk that melts when they pour the extra chocolate sauce oh and before i forget have a dirty vodka martini before you begin your dining experience the best way to relax to enjoy your dinner,Positive
db-bistro-moderne,nicely busy on a saturday at pm but my party of  was seated immediately we had the yankee burger db burger foie gras short rib and new england seafood casserole yankee burger was dull and the accompanying frites were un interesting my companions truly enjoyed their entrees and nearly liked the casserole clean,Positive
jaan,my favorite meal and michelin experience while in singapore the chef here truly understands the importance of presentation with how his dishes are prepared the only thing i will say to stay away from are the cocktails they are god awful and are a disgrace to the rest of this meal the amuse bouches were all wonderful the placement on platforms were a beautiful display the beet meringue with eel started off with this fluffy meringue that melted in my mouth followed by the fishy trout that rises to the front of my palate the devonshire cheese ball is pure pleasure an intense cheesy sensation that feels like the legs of a lover interlocking with me the buckwheat aspect does not stand out as much but that is ok in this case the fish and chips tasted more like a lemon potato tart than actual fish i enjoyed it but was my least favorite out of the bunch the duck sausage roll was a marvel in engineering as it was in taste the spring was crafted with such stability and beauty that i did not feel like eating it right away if you play with it a bit you will find that it is actually quite springy and sturdy the duck itself felt like a tongue but tasted more like a pate delicious the potato soup was a peasant meal prepared for the gods on mt olympus the soup had a treasure trove of treats and surprises with every sip i love that you drink it rather than spoon it up the macadamia nuts were such a good idea the brioche they offer with it had a lovely taste smell of parmesan cheese that complimented the soup quite well the irish oyster was a delight although the other elements like tapioca do not stand out as much the fishy profile breams like sunshine the english garden was sensory overload like walking through a bazaar so much was laid out and offered a barrage of sweet earthy floral and herby goodness the playful factor of the playing takes the experience to a whole other level bringing the inner child out in me the kombu watering can was another level of genius in the presentation of the dish worth the price of admission with this one the eggs in egg is quite the treat you have literal chicken eggs as well as fish eggs all contained within a ceramic dino egg i felt like a bird flying through the valleys of prehistoric canyons curving through the winding path of mushrooms eggs and picked acidity the pickled onions not only offered some lovely sweetness in the backdrop but provided some much needed texture every so often the smoked rosemary was a lovely touch that crept in and out of my senses the poached snapper is a slightly conservative dish but it is done so well the green peas and finger limes were a lovely canvas for the snapper and prawns to rest upon the peas were top notch making me reconsider why i hate peas to begin with the lobster was a little more of a step up in composition from the snapper in terms of progressiveness but still hits the spot high quality lobster charred grilled courgette draped in a splendid tomato broth the pigeon was the crown jewel of the meal robust and full of flavor in every bite,Positive
jaan,i hate to give this place  stars because it means so much to me my husband proposed to me in singapore and we decided to celebrate it afterwards at jaan considering that it is a well known michelin starred restaurant we booked out the private room for sgd   and i was expecting a legit private room with an amazing view considering that jaan is located on the th floor of the stamford but nope literally we had a tiny window that looked like dental floss compared to the rest of the room and the room was not even private all they did were put up room dividers to make it into a private room but we could hear everything through the room dividers what a freaking disappointment and waste of money in terms of food everything was so beautifully put together and delicious chef kirk westaway definitely demonstrated his creativity and flawless execution in each and every course of the night see attached menu photo for more detail of what we had that night service was great very timely professional and knowledgeable my husband definitely had a great time going through their extensive wine menu i would have given this place  stars if it stops here argh what made me give jaan  stars is the restroom situation so jaan shares the restroom with bar rouge right next door when i went to use it the sink was covered in puke i am guessing somebody got real drunk at the bar and the floor was disgusting if i am paying this much money to dine at a high class michelin starred restaurant like jaan i expect the restroom situation to live up to their standard disgusting i really hope jaan comes up with a solution because bar rouge is damaging their reputation,Negative
jaan,not the best michelin experience i have had but i enjoyed the food i came here to celebrate a friend is proposal with  others overall the food was thoughtfully crafted aesthetically beautiful and possessed complexity in its flavors service was professional and efficient and the timing of the courses was impeccable my biggest qualm and the reason for the star deduction was this we booked a private room which requires that a minimum s  be spent i e for a group of  each person was required to spend an additional  usd to meet this requirement one of the biggest reasons why we picked jaan was because of the gorgeous views that diners get to experience while they eat we walk into the private room and what do we see a sliver i wish i was exaggerating but i am not a sliver of a window honestly it was pathetic i get that the extra cost comes from the privacy of having your own room but that does not mean that we should be robbed of a beautiful view either we ended up having to take a couple quick photos of the city views after our meal by walking out into the main dining area which means we probably enjoyed it for a total of  minutes very disappointing,Negative
jaan,for the price and this being a michelin star restaurant i really expected more from it the service was attentive and really on the ball the view of the city from the th floor was also very nice the food though for what we paid i was expecting each and every item to knock my socks off the most underwhelming thing was the bread of all of the french restaurants i have been to located in cali nyc vegas and france they all have many different types and varieties of bread this place just had one type a wheat sour dough and did not taste good i think the best part of the meal was the dessert as all of the items did not go well together and flavors were a bit off do not think i will come back to this place even if it were free,Negative
jaan,what a wonderful experience all of the staff were brilliant with our hostess providing a delightfully quirky approach that helped us relax and settle in to enjoy the theatre that is jaan we went for the  course option but with all the treats and delights this really becomes more like  even though it is degustation and the servings appear small over the course of the meal you finished sated and your taste buds have truly experience an extraordinary variety after enjoying the truly amazing culinary delights to have chef kirk drop by for a chat was a highlight thank you for making mum is th birthday lunch such a memorable moment,Positive
jaan,totally lived up to the hype not cheap bill for three was a thousand dollars sans wine just a couple of cocktails the elements of the menu just kept coming we did the  course menu having learnt that the  course only added a few more cheese and desert elements the core of the menu is the same but with  dollars more per person the seven course ended up being an  course we got a chef special small bites to open then a series of extra desserts and a sizable birthday cake the egg in an egg was my least favorite the service was impeccable professional and polite very impressed the view was amazing ambiance  noise level   ten being the quietest taste  flavor  service  return factor  recommend,Negative
jaan,was not at all memorable chef did his obligatory visit at each table including mine and was not at all phased that i told him that nothing in his menu really stood out not only did they forgot about me when i checked in at the front desk but my view of the city was severely obstructed by another couple i guess that is what you get for being a single diner and oh by the way i am pretty sure i had more drinks and a better menu selection than that couple so if you think of it as a price per person per table ratio i am pretty sure i had them beat and i could have had a better view with my average meal several other window side tables were empty up until i had my last few courses so i was baffled on how they manage the table system bitter much yep and thanks for asking me how my meal was throughout the experience insert sarcasm here and not just at the end by the chef,Negative
jaan,a epic journey of  highly creative and flavoursome courses was enjoyed while perched on a window side table on the th floor jaan is elegant and delicious modern french fare that is part art and part science from the artisan breads to  minute poached egg perfect snapper and baked pigeon if it cannot be prepared well here where can it be the cuisine was top shelf the desserts were deliciously rich and ample and the view was the best way to appreciate the utter vibrancy that is packed into this island country of singapore low point house champagne starts from  a glass high point a lifetime memory of the finest and most picturesque dining experience,Positive
jaan,wow how to describe this experience hard with words best start at the beginning i booked some weeks ago the occasion being my hubbies birthday in my first inquiry i also stated that i would love a window table which was not available any longer we would be kept on the waiting list also they offered a complimentary birthday cake and i was able to chose up to  words on it the entire booking process was very smooth once i chose a menu  menus available you have to choose one of them per table beforehand i gave our dietary requirements and the wording on the cake i had also asked about dress code men with long trousers jeans are ok and long sleeved shirts ladies elegant and my contact patricia was very professional and friendly when i arrived on the night prior to my husband i was welcomed by patricia so nice seeing my email contact in person she was lovely and led to a window table yay surprise was her reaction my husband arrived and we ordered champagne by the glass received the amuse bouche followed by choosing a white wine this being the only element of the night i was not too pleased with as it did not taste at all like the sommelier described but that is subjective and did not diminish the overall experience the pace at which the  course menu was then served suited us fine faster in the beginning and slower toward the end we were famished and devoured the bread offered so we were glad for food arriving smoothly the food a feast for the eyes every single time and quite a show as well dry ice helps with the items on each plate being arranged in the perfect order to be scooped up just as is for the most delectable combination of flavour and aromas i have seldom had such a combination of different cooking styles fermentation slow cooking raw food that went so well together personally i do not believe much in overly experimental or molecular cooking as i want to eat properly when i am hungry and enjoy great quality combined with creative excellency as is the case with chef kirk westaway is cooking oh and chef stepped out of the kitchen to present dessert himself spraying warm chocolate mousse to die for into a variation of chocolate bowl asking everyone how they liked their food needless to say my hubbies birthday cake which was served at the end was most delectable we had it at home the next day i cannot wait for the next occasion that justifies the expense for an evening at jaan,Positive
jaan,beautiful view beautiful restaurant decor beautiful looking food and maybe romantic for a date which basically descibes jaan but that is about it been here twice for dinner lunch ordered the full chef is signatures menu each time dishes are decent use high quality ingredients taste light on the palate but nothing exciting nor interesting even though some of them had truffle truffle jus service is as expected for a fine dining establishment staff are friendly attentive however during my lunch they were supposed to serve petit fours they forgot to serve it until i asked for the price lunch is always a better value but i would recommend other better restaurants in singapore other than jaan for a good time with better tasting dishes definitely not  of the best restaurants in singapore despite being on asia is  best restaurants list,Positive
jaan,jaan derived from the ancient sanskrit word for bowl is currently ranked th in asia is  best restaurants currently lead by chef de cuisine kirk westway jaan offers elevated modern french cuisine with imaginative twists and beautiful aesthetics i visited this establishment with miss m in september  as a celebration for both of our birthdays this restaurant had been on my to go list for a very long time having only  seats in the dining room it was quite a challenge to get a reservation in their restaurant during my previous visit to singapore i had tried calling them up to reserve a table one week in advance but it was fully booked so during my subsequent trip i have made sure to e mail them about one month in advance located on the th floor of equinox complex entering the restaurant is an experience by itself there is a booth at the ground floor that leads the way to an elevator up to the restaurant after passing through several short hallways we entered the restaurant and were lucky enough to be seated at a table with a spectacular view that oversees the marina bay sands the set up of the dining room felt really special with its bright classy interior at such a high elevation this was by far the most romantic restaurant i have ever been dining at jaan was one of the best fine dining experiences i have had so far at a very affordable price point of  i would say that their lunch degustation was more than worth it however be mindful that they have an additional charge for their amuse bouche which was automatically included in our lunch their stand out dishes were the heirloom tomato collection and their rosemary infused organic egg i cannot praise them enough for the creativity and artistry demonstrated in all of their dishes all of their plates looked so aesthetically pleasing to the eyes all these factors combined along with excellent service lead to a very enjoyable meal,Positive
jaan,quite simply jaan is one of the best fine dining restaurants in singapore and another one of what i would expect to get the top michelin star marks writing about jaan on here is like doing so for andre almost every review written is much better than what i can ever write nik t birgit w and many others definitely do a great job putting an experience identical to my own into words it was a very surprising and highly impressive experience and i was there for valentine is day foodwise it was great and again i think others do a great job in putting the menu into words so instead i will write about my experience i was expecting a typical boring french restaurant that you would find in london nyc and other cities that are pretentious and uninspiring with your traditional pigeon foie gras sea bass etc but was pleasantly surprised from beginning to end where chef kirk hathaway did a hell of an amazing job putting together a menu of creative and tasteful delights yes he did use those boring ingredients i mentioned but in a very unique way with a new flavor than that i have ever had before the view also cannot be beat and you gotta do your best to get a table with the view only downsides the biggest is the wine list it is weak and lacks a lot of depth i hate the ipad wine list too and i hope these high end restaurants french laundry and per se included start getting rid of it one of the coolest and more impressive things about restaurants is if they bring out a brick of a wine list binder everyone always goes wow by it not a dirty ipad that god knows how many people touched also i am not sure if the french guy is the sommelier but he did not do much with suggestions or even offering to pour our expensive bottle of wine into a decanter it needed it i hope this was a valentine is day thing only since it was busy but there was no one there to pour the wine even after multiple requests it was on a separate table since there was no room on our table when our glasses were empty second is that i wish they only staff servers that know the food courses inside and out and are passionate about it there were a few courses where the server would come out and recite what was memorized and quickly leave which was pretty annoying for a place like that especially if i cannot understand their accent otherwise everything was perfect and made for one memorable valentine is day the staff really was very kind and made everything that we want happen for us the main server who was running around still was a total rockstar one of the greatest parts was that chef kirk actually came out and greeted us with one of the desserts we chatted for a good while about a number of topics it was awesome i hope other restaurants start adopting this personal touch highly recommend for that special someone or a great family dinner book at least a week in advance or maybe you will get lucky if booking later and on a weekday totally deserves the best,Positive
jaan,to say kirk westaway is a storyteller is an understatement he spins fairytales his attention to details the subtlety and balance in his pretty dishes the overall ebb and flow ups and downs and then that happily ever after that ended on the perfect note needless to say i was won over dish after dish during my  hour long  course dinner julien may be the punchy one but you will never get sick of kirk and you would want more of his dishes the first serving of wagyu beef tartare with a clever fish chips done a la french fine dining a foie gras and truffle macaron salty creamy sweet and chewy and an olive cracker with olive pure and cheddar cheese superbly crumbly you know this briton has a sense of humor with this french rendition of english food then came the best onion brioche i have tasted those layers and that subtle onion flavor from the land we dived right into the ocean with the majestic irish oyster from donegal with artichoke cream and oscietra caviar loved the creamy plump and firm texture of the irish oyster which was balanced with the slightly nutty artichoke cream and then you have those pops of the sea as the caviar bursts then it was back to more refreshing bites with the tomato collection kirk took the humble tomato and cheese dish and elevated it to typical jaan standard the many flavors are coaxed from the vine ripened heirloom tomato first cooked sous vide in a tomato consomm to intensify its flavours then stuffed with a mixture of cubed oxheart tomatoes gherkins capers and oregano it was then restored to its original shape by the process of dehydrating and rehydrating the fruit the supporting basil sorbet green basil and mimolette cheese pesto japanese tomato berries olive soil burrata brought out the intense sweetness of the tomato by providing a refreshing song in the background this is the most sophisticated and complicated tomato i have eaten another gorgeous plate was the farmer is harvest with hand dived scottish scallop a dish that changes with the season a combination of sous vide and roasted blanched baked pickled pureed grilled root and leafy seasonal vegetables provided the different textures and that carrasco ham added a nutty salty balance for that meaty flavor there is just so many evolving layers on  plate of course the perfectly seared scallops contribute to the meatiness of this dish a short break later and bam kirk hits home with comfort and stability with the line caught john dory served with crayfish tail fava beans broad beans clams and pea puree the dish is finished with a pea velout poured tableside i felt stuffed but i could not help but finish every bit of this perfectly browned fish this is almost an asian dish i feel the roasted venison saddle was the most heavy handed dish of the lot but the meal peaks here a new zealand venison is served medium rare with celeriac ribbons that have been blanched in wholegrain mustard emulsion pear glazed in port sauce pear chutney and celeriac puree ah such lovely christmas flavors i thought it was a tad salty for me though dessert song with a lilt high again on the ivory caramel an out of this world chocolate dessert made with  michel cluizel white chocolate flourless chocolate sponge with tempered chocolate sheets are joined by french caramelised hazelnuts and sous vide aero chocolate,Positive
jaan,what to say that has not been said before great service amazing food and nice venue if you get a table by the windows make sure to call early enough to get that we had the  course menu with the wine pairing if anything the wine pairing was the only thing that left me slightly disappointed too many whites as for best of singapore i still prefer andre it is more of an adventure but this is getting close,Positive
jaan,where do i even start i am thinking of new superlatives to give this restaurant but i will ramble anyway first we start with the view an absolutely tremendous view of the skyline able to see the singapore flyer and the gardens by the bay it is as if you are dining in a spaceship overlooking pandora from avatar fame next the service attentive and worthy of accolades from the michelin guide once it comes to singapore and definitely comparable to the some of the best restaurants in new york las vegas los angeles etc and then the food oh the food some of my most memorable food experiences have come at marea lahaina grill morimoto and le bernadin the atmosphere the company the service and most importantly the food all come together to create the best possible experience put jaan right up there on the list all of the food was perfectly seasoned cooked extremely well and presented in a way that made you just sit and admire before polishing the plate clean a phenomenal experience,Positive
jaan,the food the service the wine nothing could have been better pigeon meat was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing all chef is complimentary appetizers desert were heavenly i highly recommend this restaurant for a romantic night out a celebration or to experience a fabulous dinner whenever you travel to singapore restaurant manager frank philippe was courteous,Positive
jaan,yeah i went here last year and tried the  course lunch this was it this became the meal that all future meals would need to live up to if this review is still up it means that i have not had any better dining experience since and i have tried  restaurants i would go back to singapore just to eat here the highlight of the meal was the egg on top of a bowl of rosemary smoke the view from the building the presentation of each course the price quite reasonable and how good it all tasted easily made this the best meal of my life,Positive
jaan,jaan was the birthplace of chef andre chiang in singapore chef julien royer had big shoes to fill and i think he has done well jaan still combines great view with great food the price for the great view however is that it can be too glaring during lunch time so dont forget your sunglasses truth be told i actually came here thinking that the chef with altitude  event featuring david toutain of agape substance had started needless to say i was wrong it is from   nov the only saving grace was that they were featuring a new autumn menu phew be warned ml of chateldon sparkling water goes for  for more value ask for the free lemon slices a glass of  sancerre is    or  course menu is available for lunch at    respectively without wine pairing we went with the  course degustation lunch menu as the  course menu is a chef is surprise menu the amuse bouche was really lovely both visually and in terms of taste smoked eel with apple jelly crispy as can be chicken skin deep fried cheese balls and chef julien is interpretation of humus lentils aubergine and chestnut paste then came amuse bouche part deux mushroom tea poured into a portobello mushroom sabayon lovely complexity in texture and taste the in house bread selection wonderfully featured a choice of black truffle brioche mini baguette a sour dough and or a walnut raisin roll my recommendation is the divine black truffle brioche and the jaan staple walnut raisin roll after all that feasting  courses still remain first course bresse chicken confit oxtail and foie gras press black figs maple reduction toasted polanea terrine of chicken oxtail and foie gras rich and hearty balanced with the sweet figs and maple reduction visually tantalizing too second  rosemary smoked organic egg smoked rattes autumn mushrooms chorizo iberico buckwheatonsen eggs perfectly runny orangy yolk with soft whites slow cooked at around  degrees for mins chanterelle mushrooms and smoked rattes added earthiness and nutiness buckwheat pops texturised and chorizo iberico made it savoury lovely dry ice presentation to boot third crispy skinned atlantic mackerel pickled shallot squid sweet corn jus would olce forte as per menu description crispy skin it was fresh juicy mackerel without being overly oily finely sliced complimenting crispy baby squid finished with sweet corn mash and a sweet reduction my favourite of the lot fourth  hours kurobuta pork forgotten vegetables autumn brothby now your stomach might be stuffed but the pork belly was fork tender and melt in your mouth good the very sight of which can be a nightmare for the average healthy diner the forgotten vegetables of which i can only remember the parsnip helped cut through some of the greasiness the autumn broth which was ala tonkotsu ramen was slurped till the very last drop are we there yet nope it is pre dessert time a granny smith apple foam with basil granita and shiso leaves a very good palate cleanser fifth choconuts   sable breton tanariva chocolate tonka bean ice cream macadamia pecan nuts walnut snowchocolate mousse peanut butter more chocolate more nuts more chocolate more nuts more chocolate sweet rich and decadent done right nope post dessert time their petits fours consists of pineapple sorbet with crackling pops raspberry chocolate lollies mini madeleines nutty chocolates and pineapple jelly and finally the latte to finish was but anti climatic p s dbs posb card holders are entitled to a  discount,Positive
jaan,exceptionally good a michelin rated french restaurant on the th floor of the swisshotel features a young chef who is very talented arguably the best food i have ever eaten go there and do a degustation,Positive
jaan,i was taken to jaan for my birthday dinner after work back in june and it was one of the best meals i have had in awhile two person course meal with wine was around  including tax it is the best fine dining in singapore and the food was up to par compared with all the top restaurants in new york the restaurant is very private with only up to six tables in the whole restaurant it overlooks an amazing view facing the suntec building and you would be at awe being on the th floor of the swisshotel it was a perfect birthday dinner surprise dinner by my hubby they are known for their pigeon meat i tried for the first time and i am not sure what to think of it it is tender and tastes like chicken but it is pigeon my mind and palette were going at each other and my conclusion is that it was delish and at least i have tried it once in my life and not sure if i would try again i am an adventurous eater but eating a pigeon was a bit too much all other dishes were made to perfection and i loved each and every one of their  course meals hopefully i will return again soon,Positive
jaan,jaan is situated on the th floor of the swissotel and has a aerial view of the whole of singapore is central district the restaurant seats only  people max which means that you get a lot of personal space and dedicated service if you are able to take your eyes away from the beautiful view out of the window you will notice the crystals decorating the ceiling of the restaurant which gives the whole place a classy and ornate look i went to jaan when chef julien royer was there all the dishes were beautifully presented and the innovative and complex tastes really pushed our taste buds to the limit the service was also impeccable this is what fine dining should be and there is nothing more that i can ask for they have an extremely good for value lunch menu of  for  courses or  for  courses dinner menus costs more and you can also order from the a la carte menu the menu changes every season so do go to their website to download their latest menu,Positive
jaan,jaan is constantly rated as one of the best dining experiences in singapore and in asia so i must admit i had some pretty high expectations when arriving on the top floor of the swissotel where it is located i must say that i also had some fears about how the service would be as it was an annoying experience booking with them they required as to pre select which menu we wanted they offered three options  course degustation menu at s  per person  course prestige menu at s  per person and  course gastronomic menu at s  per person as well as providing scanned copies of the credit card to me just ridiculous to have such processes in place but anyway after some discussions with them managed to reach a solution our group had opted for the  course menu and as i am not always a fan of seafood i had asked for that to be excluded from the menu in a sense it is a really nice location with beautiful views over singapore but the design of the place is weird and does not at all look stylish or classy and to me at also lacks charm and warmth so would hope they redecorate upon arriving we were asked if we wanted a drink to start with as is too often the case we were not presented with any menu but rather just a mention of a few of the options without any prices mentioned had to specifically ask to see the wine list and then saw that many of the wines had insane mark ups even for singaporean standards we settled on a half bottle of champagne to split as we just wanted a small glass before dinner while we were then still studying the wine list and the options the first dishes started coming in no problem for us but when we were then ready to order wine for the meal the surprise came one person the table wanted the wine pairing and was then told it was impossible as he had already eaten the first dish he said it was fine just serve that wine now and he will still drink it but the staff insisted it was not possible as it was a wine pairing luckily the sommelier saw that we were not really happy at this point and came over and asked if she could help and then she quickly said it is of course not a problem still not the type of service expected at this sort of place the waitress we had actually was a bit off as she put out the cutlery on the table on the correct side of the plate for three of us but constantly reversed it for the fourth person at the table the same person who she refused to let order the wine pairing otherwise the service was fine but at nice restaurants it is the little things that should also stand out the food was ranging from very good to excellent but interestingly enough the replacement dishes i received not wanting fish and seafood were by far the best dishes and left the others at the table jealous looking at the price level of jaan the bill with wine food coffee tea came to around  sgd per person it was not at all as good as expected and it pales in comparison with some of the other top restaurants in asia thinking the likes of l effervesence takazawa narisawa issaya siamese club gaggan eat me and nahm and clearly with similar restaurants in both europe and the us so i was a but underwhelmed i am not saying that it was bad but just not good enough and i am not even ranking this as one of the best places in singapore so while perfectly acceptable i will not visit again as there are so many other better places,Negative
jaan,absolutely loved it here everything from the service to the gorgeous dishes was perfection we had the menu epicure and we enjoyed every dish i would highly recommend spending more and getting this tasting so that you can try all of their best dishes i did not want the meal to end we did not ask for it but had a table next to the window and i definitely think it is worth requesting,Positive
jaan,most memorable was the incredible service we were able to enjoy  courses in under  min w o feeling rushed staff was attentive to my incessant questioning about ingredients wine i have to admit that i was not blown away by the food itself but the unique use of temperature as a focal point certainly highlighted a few dishes,Positive
jaan,i had high hopes for this restaurant but alas they were dashed the location and sights are amazing several of the dishes tasted quite good but i think what got me was that the dishes all involved a lot of the technique of modern haute cuisine but seemingly without any real soul you probably ask what is that supposed to mean what i mean is that many of the dishes were drawn with complex and varied textures and flavors that did not merge into a coherent and meaningful whole consider the salad olive oil nodules freshly warmed berry wilted field greens heirloom carrot etc every element was done with great detail but in the end it was all sorted onto the plate like a pile well curved like a j the flavors run all over each other and there is not a core experience of what these flavors are together supposed to create in your mouth except for the amuse bouche the mushroom tea in a bodum shot glass other dishes were the same there also was no real theme to the meal that i could understand the beef was excellently cooked and served with a fine risotto but the beef and the risotto do not seem to balance and complement each other at all it seemed like there was so much excellent technique but when all was said and done the parts of the meal do not sum to anything greater than these several parts i had expected much better for the venue the hype and the price separately about service we could not stomach the oysters we even made a point to mention to the server that we thought they were bad when she asked but she made no effort to find out what we meant or to rectify it if i am asked why i did not eat something then i hope you will try to understand what i said and act on it otherwise please do not ask,Negative
jaan,this is a restaurant that competes with the best in the world falling into a fiercely competitive uber restaurant category that has it is mainstays with  course dinners finest ingredients best service culinary technique and as a result high prices the restaurants i can compare it to are alinea and true from chicago and although it was the most expensive dinner my wife and i have ever had it could not measure up to these giants of culinary excellence do not get me wrong it is still an amazing place so let me start with what i liked it holds a breath taking view at the top of the singapore swiss otel from this lofty perch it commands a view of the surrounding city as well as marina bay the ceiling has glass plates resembling mother of pearl giving you the impression there is a sort of origami clam shell floating above you both food and drinks have a wow factor i got a sort of egg white apricot bellini with the most delightful hard whipped foam on top food taste was excellent using the best ingredients in the most delightful combinations some dishes had excellent presentation namely the amuse bouche was perhaps one of the largest and best presentations i have had it came on a mix of holders some rock others bamboo and had a sauce you would eat out of a stylized can another favorite presentation was when we received a carton of eggs opened up with dry ice billowing a fog below it the egg was deposited by our waiter onto the top of a delicious soup all i have said so far is amazing so why  stars indeed it is not in the piece by piece breakdown but in the comparison to other cream of the crop restaurants that brings it down i think back to alinea where i ate a fruit leather balloon or had a decadently filled chocolate urn shattered onto my waterproof tablecloth those were wow moments i never even imagined food could be served like this jaan did not offer surprises of this level dinner prices are the equivalent of an intercontinental flight a meal at this price is one you do not just hope to remember you need to remember it one way of facilitating this is through a printout you can take of the menu i have gotten these each time even embossed with my name on them it is not that i am going to frame the thing but it can certainly help me remember the experience fondly when the cheese tray rolled around as one of the last items i thought to myself well i am pretty full already but heck this is probably some grade a amazing cheese and i have already paid for it i was half right although we had some smelly flavorful cheeses elegantly served they were not included in our chef is tasting menu i am a bit upset that i was served cheese costing  without anyone bothering to inform me it was not included i had that expectation from other fine dining restaurants that had included it i would have certainly denied it to fill up on more of what was to come if i had known all in all the food was great in taste but presentation that was not up to par with other uber restaurants and not being told about the extra costs set this experience back for me,Positive
jaan,jaan is definitely the place for special occasions they have various set meals to choose from to suit anyone is taste and budget enjoyed the food and presentation was very nice so nice it was a waste to actually eat it service and ambiance is perfect highly recommended place for special occasions,Positive
jaan,one of the best set lunches in town at this price point none of the dishes are boring which is more than i can say for many overpriced overrated fine dining establishments around the flavours here are complex but down to earth and put together with a light deft touch,Positive
jaan,interesting but felt chef was trying to hard way too complex compilation and presentation we had  course dinner which was actually ten or eleven it was just too much it is difficult to explain for an example one dish had many ingredients in the bowl it was served with an egg heated to  degrees for  minutes and was pointed out this was an exact process they then poured the soft egg onto other contents in bowl and stir guess what it tasted like a bowl of yolk which is fine but what is the point of all the other ingredients all were like this the foie gras was best i ever had but all the other stuff took away from it the pidgin brest was the only thing i really enjoyed cooked to perfection it was only thing i could eat alone although it to was served with a bunch of other distracting stuff i just ignored all in all the complexity was a gastronomic distraction and i felt i was eating various states of stews and goulashes a great chef should be able to produce spectacular dishes without so much variation in one serving one dish had perfect piece of fish served with bits of fried squid topped with caviar and then a bunch of odd greens and sprouts served as a meal with appropriate portions it could have complemented one another but to eat all that in a single bite you got none of the pleasantness of the ingredients and were just left with a mouthful of fishy mush well just one persons thoughts,Negative
waku-ghin,waku ghin is a phenomenal meal the uni is obviously the stand out dish but on reflection every course is exquisite in its own fashion the seared amadai had a smokey crispness the wagyu was divine and deserts superb it ended up pp incl  glasses of wine each this is a crazy expensive meal and there are more affordable tasting menus elsewhere however if you love seafood you cannot miss this meal,Positive
waku-ghin,i was able to fortuitously find a seat in this temple of japanese inspired cuisine in singapore but you should book weeks in advance if you want a seat they only serve  customers at a time in small  people dining rooms in front of a grill and your own chef dinner is omakase only with a price tag of sgd plus tax and of course you may wish to pair it with wines a wine pairing where every dish comes with a recommended wine or sake costs additional sgd service is elegant but also extremely personal since i was dining alone my server made a point to strike conversation a couple of times gently and always respectfully i really appreciated the tone and the courtesy of all the servers the dinner starts with impressive raw seafood dishes among which i certainly was amazed by their signature dish a composition of sea urchin uni shrimp and caviar one of the most delicious dishes i ever had and i traveled extensively in japan tasting some of the best kaiseki ryori in the country other gems followed tagliolini with caviar and freshly grated truffle abalone gently grilled and then smoked in front of us with cherry blossoms a bouillabaisse of lobster delight after delight concluded by a delicious and delicate ochazuke each dish was expertly described along with suggestions to enjoy its flavor at the best after dinner each party is moved to their own table together with people from the other rooms in another common dining space overlooking the marina and the famous singapore skyline not to mention the light and fountain show here delicious desserts are served pre dessert main and petit four in a very customary sequence in summary this was a masterpiece dining experience flawless from start to finish in all its most minute details the price tag is serious but i am not regretting a single dollar at the end of this sumptuous dinner,Positive
waku-ghin,tldr bar service was great this review is for the bar service and not the  course meal my wife and i came in the evening on a weekday and were promptly greeted and seated our server was knowledgeable about all the dishes and amply explained things i ended up getting their pear fruit cocktail and a melon cocktail underneath their japanese fruit cocktail section which were both delectable we split the lobster spaghetti wagyu chim over rice and the fried chicken the wagyu was so wonderfully fatty you could feel you are gallbladder contract after eating it i was only here on vacation but next time i might plan ahead for the  course meal which looks incredible per my server it is usually a one or two weeks advance reservation but call in case there is openings the night of,Positive
waku-ghin,omg one of the best dining experiences i have ever had first to start just walking into this place feels vip and the cocktails are phenomenal the muscat cocktail was my favorite to start with and the japanese peach we were seated in the bar area first and when our private room was ready we went in it is pretty amazing that everyone gets a chefs table seat and you get to watch majority of the food prepared in front of you it is an omakase that consists of fresh seafood and some meat dietary requests can be accommodated as well but i myself do not have any so i just go with whatever the suggest chef tetsuya is mega famous and he is literally the god father of soooooo many world renowned talented chefs i honestly do not even know if he knows how many of his offspring are very successful chefs with multiple restaurants under their belts in highly populated cities i have been to many tetsuya offspring restaurants so although it was my first time eating at his restaurant and even though it was prepared by one of his chefs and not him the dishes were embraced by my palette i left this restaurant soooo happy even though we came to celebrate my hubby is bday i felt like it was mine every dish was beyond amazing i am a big fan of the abalone the prawn and the wagyu cooked to perfection as well as their signature dish the sea urchin baby shrimp caviar just stunning the seafood bouboulaise with bread was also excellent i hope to come back sometime in this lifetime,Positive
waku-ghin,kenscale   the best meal i had during my stay in singapore also happened to be the most expensive one i would not say that a more expensive meal would necessarily be the best but the one i had at waku ghin was just absolutely fantastic i would definitely say it is one of my all time best japanese meals of my lifetime located inside the famed marina bay sands hotel where i stayed just so i could check out the fabulous infinity pool and helmed by internationally acclaimed chef tetsuya wakuda waku ghin has long been one of the pillars of the great gastronomic scene at waku ghin you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve  course degustation menu priced at whopping s  per person thank god the dollar to singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get the chef will bring a gigantic plate of all the raw seafood that will be a part of your meal with that price tag each dish really had to be worth every penny which is a nearly impossible feat yet waku ghin pulled this out beautifully there were some really taste bites of seafood from japanese sawara mackerel that worked beautifully with eggplant and seaweed vinaigrette to slow cooked new zealand john dory with grilled eggplant to roasted new zealand scampi one of the signature dishes at the restaurant the marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served inside the sea urchin shell was pure nirvana and i could seriously eat this dish any given day the best dish in my mind however was the impeccable tasmanian abalone that came with fregola pasta and tomato it showed that the restaurant could also draw a page from western influence and i still cannot forget the beautifully cooked abalone that worked wonders with the pasta i was also deeply impressed with the braised canadian lobster that came with aromatic tarragon jus lobster was as perfectly cooked as it ever gets and the tarragon jus worked its magic to further add another dimension to the dish an assortment of fabulous seafood was followed by some meat dishes deboned spatchcock chicken was well cooked and worked harmoniously with black truffle my only compliant with wagyu roll was that there was too little of it but otherwise the meat is texture was absolutely juicy and tender following a serving of soothing somen and gyokuro green tea i was led to the main dining area where desserts started coming in tasmanian leatherwood honey ice cream with granite of lemon and gin jelly a light and refreshing dish was followed by ghin cheesecake ghin stands for silver in japanese another winning dessert that i wished i could have more of the restaurant has a classy and formal vibe but i still saw families with casual apparel enjoying their casual time together the services of the professionally dressed staffs were attentive and you can complement your meal with a variety of drinks from wine to sake to cocktails waku ghin will blow your mind if you are looking for a serious japanese fare with western touches i have always been impressed with the craftsmanship dedication and discipline that japanese chefs display and while the glitzy atmosphere of marina bay sands may make you think the meal at waku ghin is overpriced and overrated it is anything but okay maybe the price may force you to eat cheap food for the next month or so but if you are looking for a once in a lifetime meal waku ghin is pretty damn close,Positive
waku-ghin,never thought i would say this but i found a downside to spontaneity and that is cannot get reservations anywhere so i figured i will just eat at the bar it is a la carte at the bar there is both counter and tables at the bar ordered the steak it was okay the sauce was too sweet which really did not help bring out the flavor of the steak normally i love sweet sauce on anything so i do not know what they did wrong with this sauce just did not go perhaps the food is better not at the bar but after this steak i am not dying to come back,Negative
waku-ghin,i guess our expectations were different and we did not have the required refined tastes to enjoy the meal we were a party of  had the omakase ofc some v expensive sake and xs  of still water overall i was dissapointed maybe i did not enjoy the subtleness of the  well presented courses enough but honestly i was expecting to be wowed but in the end i came away with  reasons why i could have eaten elsewhere for  food but much much better value the uni was decent and the a wagyu was ok but everything else was sub par and honestly not worth the  do not forget gst service we paid per person however our chef from japan was a highlight in an otherwise mediocreally supposed ta be haute gastronomic experience like the new hublot ferrari engine watch or not o well at least they had phone charger for my poor android phone also was expecting like otoro or some other sashimi but o well i guess u cannot choose in omakase,Negative
waku-ghin,there is a reason why this place is ranked as one of the top  restaurants in the world a culinary experience not to be missed,Negative
waku-ghin,amazing food great service and superb wine pairing my favorite was the cold noodle at the end of the meal it was surprising refreshing,Positive
waku-ghin,my life is complete i ate off of the bar menu at waku ghin because the actual meal was definitely out of my price range even though the bill still came out to about  usd for  people this is likely one of the best food related choices i have ever made in my life from the drinks to the food everything was top notch just as i thought i had reached ecstasy the next bite always proved me wrong we ordered  dishes lobster open face sandwich sea urchin set on vinegared rice with caviar spaghettini with alaskan king crab tomato i have sat around for  minutes thinking about how to describe these dishes but i simply cannot find the words to justify how good they were the spaghettini is the most ordinary and replicable dish here the lobster sandwich and uni caviar were out of this world and completely indescribable we also had   drinks each i ordered various sake cocktails all of which required an amazing level of creativity to create i have never seen or had sake cocktails in america so this was refreshing and intriguing for me my girlfriend ordered  fresh fruit cocktails each of them were blended into a smoothie but were also unique in its own way the passion fruit cocktail was blended with real passion fruit so the freshness of the fruit and the seed were all infused into the drink the grapefruit cocktail had separate and distinct pulps that exploded in your mouth as you drink and popped them the bartenders here really outdid themselves i apologize for my inability to do justice in describing the food however i can confidently say that this was the best meal i have ever had which is incredible because the food was ordered off of its bar menu,Positive
waku-ghin,dear wakuda san i hope this letter finds you well my father won big by taking germany to win the world cup and so was able to dine in your restaurant last night coincidentally it was his birthday but alas he dined without me as he said you were too expensive for kids to tag along the first thing he said when i saw him this morning was son you need to study really hard and make sure that you can speak clearly and communicate properly i was perplexed but apparently the uncles and aunties who served him last night were not able to do so without him constantly having to ask them to repeat what they said again and again despite that service was still good but communications was a big f i guess your exquisite culinary creations have to speak for themselves the awkward teppanyaki counter setup further detracted from the dining experience as it proved more of an obstacle to service rather than a chance to showcase your gourmet menu frankly speaking there were no knives flying nor fancy schmancy cooking skills that warrants the teppanyaki counter is existence anything he had from the teppan could easily have been cooked in the kitchen the only good thing about it was he got to snap more shots for posting on yelp he also mentioned another uncle customer commented on how you no longer cook your abalone dish at the counter anymore so it is just the canadian lobster tasmanian cape grim beef and japanese ohmi wagyu beef that benefited from the under utilized obtrusive teppan you are probably better off without it but obviously he loved your food  stars for that alone he flew to sydney just to dine at your flagship restaurant and has been ever so effusive about your delicate cooking that incorporates the best produce and is always full of flavours just check out his gazillion photos when he gets round to uploading them all and you cannot help but click on like he said that it looks as good as it tastes or is it the other way around anyway just when he thought dinner was over you moved him into a much cosier environment for his just desserts the pre dessert kyoho grapes and granita was simple but amazing so sweet yet with a tinge of sour and the icy granita kept those seedless halves just firm enough before melting away in your mouth the dessert proper was a mango passion fruit cremet d anjou not properly explained and he had to refer to the menu they printed out for him it was quality but nothing mind blowing then he was surprised with what looks like your signature chocolate cake with perfectly scribbled chocolate birthday wishes thank you for saving me the trouble of having to buy him a birthday cake i mean the cake i buy can never come close to the velvety finish that he mentioned in passing finally your petit cinq completed a lovely evening of gastronomy even though he was so full he still popped every single one into his mouth instead of bringing some home for me uncle you kept him away for a good  hours but that was a good thing as it allowed the bottle of tsuki no katsura iwaimai nigori junmai daiginjo to vanish and for him to depart on a sake high thank you for making it an overall memorable evening for him yours sincerely nik juniorp s hopefully he does not have to wait till the next world cup to be back again,Positive
waku-ghin,waku ghin is a great restaurant with a plethora of flavors to keep your taste buds busy it will also make you feel as inflated as a blimp afterwards since it is just so much food also be sure to set aside   to  hours to dine here it is long took off a star because i was only wow would by one of the courses and drinks are below mediocre most of the dishes are good but not memorable i have been here on two separate occasions once i came alone after a friend was stuck at work and the second time with my girlfriend on one of our first dates you walk into the casino area of mbs and are pleasantly welcomed by the staff as they open the doors for you and and seat you to your room where you will sit alongside   other couples was a bit awkward when i came solo your chef comes into the room and introduces himself along with what he calls the menu or simply a showcase of the fish that will be prepared for the meal you say ok and move on with your culinary journey both of my experiences i had essentially the same dishes i believe it was the same season in two different years since the menu changes by season i had the following out of order unfortunately  shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served in a sea urchin shell their signature dish excellent as one would expect ocean trout with witlof and yuzu ok beef with arugula simple but meat was cooked nicely lobster in a garlic type sauce this was very nicely done king crab leg cooked and covered over a bed of salt and bamboo leaf this is the one dish that stood out for me easily my favorite and one i could rave about  live steamed abalone served with fregola pretty much your typical abalone dish but with a slight twist  japanese waygu beef slice with garlic chips and fresh wasabi nice consomme with rice and snapper good somen with myoga and junsai nice refreshing dish honey ice cream with gin and lemon jelly sweet yet easy to eat cheesecake unfortunately was just a cheesecake my girlfriend and i both had cocktails which to me were both pretty bad we even went to the bar after and had drinks there and they were mediocre at best for a bar that advertises itself throughout the hotel they really are not that good wish we stuck with sake after these experiences i really was not that wow would most of the flavors are those you can find if you have any of these fish at other restaurants except the king crab leg which blew my mind the setting and setup are all very cool but i definitely left hoping for much more that i did not get and i can only imagine that these guys will get better most of the dishes again are good but not great and memorable if michelin came to singapore these guys would for sure be in the mix for a potential  stars since they fit the criteria but they need to build more dishes with truly unique and memorable flavors otherwise i think it is worth a shot to try it out for the experience,Positive
waku-ghin,waku ghin constantly one of frontrunners for best restaurant in singapore a meal there will set you back a cool  per head not counting water or wine even then i am going to say it is worth going at least once each course is a myriad of flavours and textures all meant to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients in as dazzling a way as possible the signature dish of marinated botan ebi sea urchin and oscietra caviar is salty yet sweet clean tasting yet rich and amazingly it was not even my favourite dish personally i felt that it was just a little too ostentatious a little too opulent the charcoal grilled beef served with mustard was real delight the beef was full flavoured and the smoky flavour of the grill lingered in the most teasing of ways every time a dish came in a broth we ended up drinking from the bowl because apparently spoons were not always part of the dining experience but the amount of time and quality of ingredients that went into each of those nourishing liquids must have been significant because they were all packed with flavour dessert was a little lacklustre after the brilliance of the courses before it the simple coconut mousse with mango was almost insipid by comparison and a rather disappointing portion size at that one thing i must highlight however is that the service really impressed it was not as subtle or unobtrusive as i have experienced at other top class restaurants but they did manage one thing that sets them apart from any other dining experience i have had in singapore they noticed i was left handed and proceeded to place all the cutlery as a left hander would use it opposite of the normal place settings i have never had that ever happen in singapore overseas yes and that alone redeemed the seamless but average service we received for the rest of the evening,Negative
waku-ghin,located in the glitzy expanse of marina bay sands waku ghin definitely offers culinary decadence the experience is without a doubt very expensive but the  course degustation meal was hands down among my favorite of all time i am certain that i cannot describe the plates any better than the previous reviews have however i can confidently say that the food tastes as good as the descriptions and pictures project what stood out to me most though was the precision and attentiveness of the service if you want to be left alone to eat a meal in the corner this is not your place the staff here are incredibly well trained and go impressively above and beyond to be accommodating to their guests,Positive
waku-ghin,we love japanese food and we love waku ghin t ambiance is frendly but can be formal n stiff depends on t company ypu are with food is always good t few times   bin der it has been most satisfactory love it,Positive
waku-ghin,in the world of celebrity chefs tetsuya wakuda is up there with the best in the world many of us have had the privilege of dining at his sydney restaurant tetsuya is but how many of us have had the opportunity to dine at his singapore restaurant waku ghin well now i can add myself to those lucky people waku ghin translates to arise silver and pays homage to tetsuya is routes offering a  course japanese inspired degustation menu the restaurant is located in the iconic marina bay sands complex and offers a unique dining experience in fact waku ghin was just voted in the  s pellegrino top  restaurants of the world now that is an achievement the experience of waku ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff to the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge perfect for pre dinner drinks continue through the restaurant and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway with private teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least there is nothing ostentatious about the space warm timber compliments features of slick silver with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance alongside glimpses of the singapore skyline the restaurant seats only  people at a time offering  sittings each evening guests are seated in private teppanyaki rooms this evening mr j and i have our own personal teppanyaki chef dedicated to creating our  course degustation menu we share our teppanyaki room with another couple who also have their own personal chef the  course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us i should also note you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list if you cannot find something to tickle your fancy then you are not looking hard enough with our wine and food sorted we proceed to sit back relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at waku ghin our menu like oyster scallop with daikon and oyster leaf marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar grilled tailfish with japanese matsutake pan seared foie gras with kyoho australian abalone with fregola and tomato braised canadian lobster with tarragon charcoal grilled australian lamb with couscous japanese ohmi wagyu roll from shiga prefecture with wasabi and citrus soy scampi pasta gyokuro our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat i cannot help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive at least we know it is fresh our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish one at a time carefully explaining the dish as he goes along i love the personal interaction with the chef and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art as a plate of food each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated wow coming out of my mouth time and time again every one of those  courses achieves the same reaction once our degustation is complete we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert the room offers spectacular views of the singapore skyline our dessert menu cold soup of dates with tonka bean ice cream and orange pistachio ice cream with raspberry and chantilly coffee or tea and petit fours the desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening we are each presented with a personal menu dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening a lovely touch and memento though pricey dining at waku ghin is an amazing experience from the food to the decor to the service this is seamless top class dining this is an experience i am going to remember for a long time to come,Positive
waku-ghin,amazing food watching the preparation was great too overall a fantastic experience,Positive
waku-ghin,a place for high rollersat  per head before taxes waku ghin is a big commitment even before you start your dinner and yes they take your credit card upon reservation if you do not show up they deduct the price anyway the set up of the  seater restaurant is sparse and muted the main element is silver ghin which apparently is chef is favourite diners perch on uncomfortable bar stools for most of the  hour  course meal before moving to the lounge to be served a sliver of dessert service is not up to par as expected having told the receptionist that i was dining there on occasion of my birthday we were greeted with complete indifference not even an acknowledgement of the big day no matter the non existent service throughout the meal at least meant we were not bothered by inept staff the food is top notch comprising ingredients that are at the very top of their category and treated minimally at the teppan counter the private chef one to every  diners does a show and tell for his dishes before preparing it whether searing a piece of wagyu or cooking the abalone to the perfect texture some dishes are prepared in the kitchen such as the signature of botan shrimp and creamy hokkaido sea urchin the customised teppan plate is truly the star having your food cooked before your eyes does much to whet the appetite for normal folks waku ghin is a one time splurge but high rollers apparently dine there weekly so i guess the standard of the food will always be high just know what to expect it is not haute gastronomy the likes of restaurant andre or jaan and you will probably enjoy your  worth of prime ingredients done well,Negative
waku-ghin,this is hands down my favorite restaurant in singapore the ambiance and the food defines what good dining experience should be it is expensive and reservations are hard to come by but its worth it,Positive
manhattan,finally visited the famed manhattan bar walked in with no reservations and had two seats by bar which was where i would have wanted anyway amazing drinks collection including full cocktails that have been aged in casks by entrance amazing i had a hakushu distiller reserve sherry part of the house finished spirit it is smokey and has a reddish hue compared to a normal hakushu and very interesting he had loads of cocktails and all were really amazing harvey wallbanger jack rose new york etc their singapore nation a variation of the singapore sling is amazing sophisticated service was terrific great staff dressy waitresses bartenders were also very passionate about their drinks we were served by frank and he really made our night fun informative with drinks and good recommendations a lovely night out,Positive
manhattan,stars one of sg is most famous bars and often referred to as one of the best bars in asia this is a classy old new york feel cocktail bar in the regent hotel a wide variety of cocktail selection and everything tastes good though a bit on the stronger side great service,Positive
manhattan,the sort of place that a hipster from crazy rich asians would be a regular at the bar is classy and intimate the drinks are impeccable and the service is on point,Positive
manhattan,i have been to a lot of top tier bars in the world i have been to the majority of the top  bars in the world over the past  years without being aware then being aware at times i have been to bars that should have definitely been in the top  but are not i am stating all facts not bragging take it as you want to do not really care i like bars with class that is clearly evident the top  bars in the world are always mostly meh in my opinion but this place i can see why it is a winner i have only said this about the artesian years ago presentation service cocktails food atmosphere staff menus etc everything is on point it is sleek af except they were not doing their violet hour thumbs down i am out mic drop,Negative
manhattan,chic high end quality type of bar with a sexy vibe definitely dress up and not down at this establishment drinks are well over  a piece but the cocktails are too delicious to pass up they serve bar snacks with your cocktail which was a cute addition to our experience worth giving this place a try for a speakeasy type of feel,Positive
manhattan,very cool place inviting from the start you walk into a dark but cozy and high end bar plush seating down the center with slow tables on either side you really need to make a reservation if you want to be seated at one of the tables otherwise you will get a seat at the bar we were early and with no reservations could only sit at the bar the bartender attended to us right away providing us with menus a glass of water and a bowl of popcorn to snack on on the right had side as you walk in you can find their whiskey and bourbon barrels and on the left their spirits i had the  mile out plantation pineapple rum michter is us straight rye ferrand dry curaao lemon grenadine prohibition can only extend so far hardly an obstacle to ambitious entrepreneurs who sail wealthy patrons to international waters for a day of carousinghe had the mad men balvenie double wood  years st germain black walnut bitters perrier jout grand brut the hard drinking hard partying kings of madison avenue would approve of this masculine year elegant delight it was served with a very cool ice cube embossed with the manhattan logo both were delicious service was very good the bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable we were able to walk around and take some pictures everyone was friendly and accommodating highly recommend it for cocktails and a respite,Positive
manhattan,i think this is a wannabe bar not living up to its hype really dark inside but not really hiding anything i never sought out a cave for a drink surprised to find this cave in a nice hotel forced to go there as all restaurants closed at  pm music is really crap i liked some of it because i am pretty old young hip crowd would hate it too loud and no balance plus this cave is naturally very loud with screaming patrons piercing the ancient tunes with their drunken shrieks staff pleasant but slow to serve maybe lost in the dark food think sushi portions really tiny they said this was the  bar in asia at the reception this is not true asia has a million better bars,Negative
manhattan,i joined regent hotel so i wented here at night it was good music so many people server gave me more times popcorn it was goodfood was goodcoctail was good,Positive
manhattan,the drinks were nice but the playlist was straight from spotify weird overall nice place but overrated and pricey for not having a dj pay music,Negative
manhattan,i paid  for the adult is only brunch but it is worth it as i felt like i was transported out of singapore for an afternoon in a good way the service was really on point and the food was great the food offered had less variety compared to some other hotel brunches but i felt that there was more than sufficient in fact i met up with friends for dinner later that evening and could not manage to eat a bite the selection is limited to western food but honestly who eats an upscale version of hawker food when at a hotel buffet the seafood king crab legs yum was amazing and the cheese and charcuterie selection made me happy just by looking at it also do not i repeat do not skip the jalapeo cheddar biscuits as they are da bomb i could go on and on about the fantastic desserts the nice mains the great salad the foie gras but let is just keep it to the food is really delicious obviously the drinks do deserve a separate mention as they are one of the attractions they serve free flow cocktails plus beer and wine and have a good selection to suit every palate you can even ask them to customize your drink if there is an ingredient you do not like the diy bloody mary was pretty impressive a wide variety of alcohol bases plus a super cool condiment selection are offered and hallelujah they had ranch for my bloody mary to make things even better the service was pretty awesome we were greeted immediately by our friendly waiter he was happy to give recommendations and was very attentive we never had to ask to top up our water and our cocktails were refilled before they were empty heck he even asked if i was sure i wanted one drink when last rounds were called he offered to get me two this is the place where i want to celebrate my next birthday promotion engagement farewell to singapore some of these are more likely to happen than others you guess which or just when i deserve a treat recommended,Positive
manhattan,d and i were taken here by our friends for the adult is only cocktail buffet at regent hotel and it was the perfect place to chat away for a couple date or for large parties as well like the name the bar really takes me back to new york it mimics the library bar in ny and the atmosphere is hip and relaxed at the same time exactly what we were looking for on a lazy sunday afternoon it would be a perfect place to hang out at night though i only came here for the past three times during the day what prompted me for a review was this adults only buffet that was only made available around a year ago it is a bargain  pax when most a la carte cocktail drinks are sgd each try each cocktail listed in the menu in order around  of them and you will get more than your money is worth every single one was delish and by the last one we all had a good buzz on top of that it includes endless dishes of oysters foie gras crab legs steak and the best dessert selection i have had in awhile the buffet selection is not expansive but they present only the best ingredients so it was more than enough for us book early it is usually booked a month in advance they take your credit card to secure the spot and it is open only on sundays from   to  pm and as peter l mentions it is one of the top  bars in the world so it is def worth a visit it was funny to see what alcohol does to people most of the people were still in their seats by their pm closing time that the waiters had to kindly ask everyone to leave will return again for daytime fun with friends,Positive
manhattan,really cool bar with a really cool concept and space but there are a few mishaps as well ok so the fact that manhattan is one of the top  bars in the world was one of the reasons why i stopped by and for the cocktails the award may be well deserved the menu is very creative sectioned into various neighborhoods in nyc the focus is on well executed classics as well as some house specials loved the violet hour   where you get a free drink and sandwich i really enjoyed my classics like a red hook and a barrel aged presidente service is solid but the food is weak some of it was quite good like the sliders but the mac and cheese for  was micro bland and nasty and this is where manhattan will fall short compared to anti dote or even  hk i will definitely be back for drinks but it is better to fuel up on some food before coming here,Positive
manhattan,the cocktails in singapore the burbon collections matches any in the us the mescal cocktails are to die for,Positive
manhattan,this is such a sexy bar with delicious cocktails and amazing staff it is such a fun place to sip libations and have a conversation or have a date it is so beautiful and so well decorated make sure you walk throughout the space,Positive
manhattan,high class bar situated in the regents hotel the basic concept is an american bar added with lounge seats the drinks are on the top level you expect from such a place the menu is divided into sections standing for different cocktail areas starting with the colonization over the prohibition area ies ies umbrella loving ies until today for each decade there are specific drinks selected as well as food fitting to drinks and era in addition drinks with ingredients from the own rickhouse can also be found on the menu so your normal everyday drink will definitively taste different,Positive
manhattan,today friends and i made our first visit to manhattan bar to enjoy the sunday adults only cocktail brunch the regent has taken the sunday brunch concept and given it a deliciously refreshing twist from    pm we enjoyed cocktails served by an amazing staff and a limited buffet of delicious food served in a dimly lit elegant comfortable bar setting last but not least there is a no children policy all of this adds up to my new favorite sunday brunch spot the cocktail brunch menu choices leaned toward the sweet side wine and beer are also available and there is an upcharge for champagne it would be an improvement if they would double the number drinks on their brunch menu to a wider selection i drank mostly bloody marys and added my own toppings at a diy toppings bar in order for you to survive the  hour marathon the drinks are prepared a little weaker than normal that is understandable but it would be nice if they would ramp up the alcohol content as the afternoon progressed by  pm i was not tipsy enough and for a cocktail brunch that is a major failure the food buffet items were all delicious cheese board oysters lobster prawns scallops seared tuna numerous desserts salad and bagel bar additional items included in the price are ordered from the menu pan fried smoked foie gras braised short ribs and a blt salad were especially exquisite the staff was attentive gracious and amazing keeping the drinks and food flowing without delay this is some of the best service i have seen in singapore and they were a big part of what made the experience so enjoyable the good the overall concept the elegant bar setting the staff the food the no children policy the bad weaker than normal sweet selection of signature cocktails i believe the simple fix here is to request options not on the brunch menu and ask that they make them stronger the verdict the up for the cocktail buffet is  but we each received  off for today is facebook promotion if you enjoy a boozy sunday brunch give manhattan bar a visit,Positive
manhattan,i was taken here on a sunday afternoon for their adults only brunch buffet which features a bagel station seafood maine lobster oysters crab station big big range of desserts a small menu of hot food to be ordered a bloody mary station cheese station um i also drank a lot because drinks were free flow what is there not to love seafood was fresh bagels were made by a nice guy who brings it to your table the foie gras hot item was very much loved and all washed down with booze you stumble home in a cab and enjoy the rest of your sunday after this brunch service was also impeccable p s the prices are shocking,Positive
manhattan,if you are looking for some impressive bar grub to go along with those cocktails this is the place for you from lobster rolls to ahi tuna fried dumplings you are all set to ditch the post drinks supper run dive for the fried bread butter pickles which sets the perfect thrill to the numbing cocktails drinks wise fancy concoctions but nothing to shout about they are known for their aged barrel offerings which are essentially pre mixed concoctions stored in an aged barrel but this pretty much means you do not get to give it that bespoke twist which is all the rage these days,Positive
manhattan,i stayed at the regent for a couple of months forwork must be new people working the door i waslooked up and down and quickly brushed off seem like the atmosphere of the regent is not as friendly as before went right to the st regis and the astor bar was warm and friendly and much nicer attitude,Positive
manhattan,edited after sobering up ricky paiva has brought with him the best bar in singapore bar none if you are experienced and know your drink just have a look at the bar this bar costs a mint in both its interior decor the bottles of exclusive and extremely hard to get liquor all the way up to how the bar is presented to the crowd there is meant to be a rickhouse in the premises but i did not have the opportunity to develop the conversation for me to sneak a peek at it last night there is no live entertainment here but ricky is taste in caberet style music background suits the scene perfectly manhattan is so out of place for a regent chain hotel because i would have expected the more up market parent four seasons to host this or one of the  to  star hotel chains to ask ricky to join them in their a team but what results is just fantastic as cheryl n ms skinny fat indicated this bar is very stylish i would not go so far as her to say its nineteenth century but hell she was probably having such a good time it did not matter if she interpreted it as th century or not the contemporary setting seems to exude its own classic presence made up of marble oak and leather and what results is just classy even exceeding raffles hotel standards in my books the point of it is that you can have a complete blast here i do not have much experiences with rickhouses but i do drink single malt is and am able to appreciate fine liquor and wines and hold my drink reasonably well with that said let me walk you through what we had food rebellion burger and street styled hot dogs let me just say that i thought this is the best mini burger i have had the meat patty almost melts in your mouth it beats bacchanalia is burger and makes most other burgers from any other hotel or reputable restaurant brands look lame the hot dog is definitely the best hot dog in singapore we also ordered the shrimp ceviche taco which was quite good but after the burger and the hot dog we recommend you have this first as a starter because once you get into the burger and the hot dog there is no going back the green pepper maize n blaze is quite good also but again do this first drink we started with the recommended new york sour a mix of bourbon port maple syrup lemon bitters and egg white and the  club made up of gin lemon mint and seltzer water i think people who like mohita type drinks will appreciate the  club and it is definitely a drink for those who do not really drink to kick off the evening the new york sour is interesting and do require you to have a broader and more refined taste in your mixed drinks department to appreciate nevertheless we enjoyed both immensely the alcohol content and levels was not getting to us so we moved onto the eighth ward think its made up of bourbon whiskey vermouth dry curacao and remember the mame bourbon whiskey and do not ask i was enjoying it too much these drinks will knock your socks off as the whiskey leaps out at you and the supplementary ingredients just brings out the drink is own personality in its own very unique way if you are a single malt whiskey drinker these drinks might actually taste more gimmicky but ricky has managed to add a level of sophistication and variety into these mixes that i feel they are just wow its like having one of those boutique beers for the first time expanding your appreciation of beers in a different direction and in a very unique way what ricky has managed to achieve just puts the icing on the cake in terms of a whiskey concoction you simply cannot experience anything like this in singapore until now we were not fortunate enough to try their negroni as they had run out and were waiting for the existing stock to take in the oak if you want to experience the best the bar has to offer strike up a conversation with ricky or one of his senior mixologists yes that is what they do in real bars and pubs we did both and we were not disappointed at the least,Positive
manhattan,great selection of liquors really elegant bar and service is really on point here i once booked the lounge area for a private event and one of my guests left something personal behind staff was able to track him down and return it i would come more often if it were not so out of the way for me,Positive
manhattan,i have not quite found a drinking hole i like as much since i left college and our in house college bar several years ago manhattan bar hits all the right spots and has that quiet yet lovely bar vibe not unlike my old college bar it was a late evening when my friend called me up to grab drinks at  pm while i was not at home i was told by said friend that it would be semi formal dress as manhattan is a classy hotel bar and was recently named one of the world is top  bars congratulations bar owners after a frantic half hour borrowing outfits i jumped on a cab to regent hotel only to discover that there is no dress code of course one would not turn up completely dressed down but if you are not in fancy dress they would not kick you out the steak sliders i had were excellent their perfectly medium rare patties were quite the surprise although my friend had already known this from an event she had previously been to at manhattan we ended up ordering two sets although we had both just eaten dinner the drinks we had were also just right i usually shy away from drinks with absinthe as the absinthe could leave an after taste that i do not cannot appreciate but the cocktail i had was fruity and i could barely tell there was absinthe in it the fresh ingredients taste lovely with the liquors for the quality of food and drinks i would easily award them four stars the drinks and sliders are about  odd dollars each and the bill came up to  for  sets of sliders  sliders in total and  drinks the last star though was awarded for the atmosphere it was quiet enough for us to talk comfortable but lively enough to be alone and not feel alone a foreigner sat beside us nursing a drink alone and he was soon joined by another chatty patron and his friends who noticed him lookong about the bar and decided to strike a conversation another solo guest sat reading a book it was this friendly bar culture and vibe that really reminded me of why i loved the college bar despite its crappy drinks now if the prices here could be the same as a college bar it would be the perfect bar,Negative
manhattan,manhattan you definitely lived up to the hype and now i will forever be spoiled for sunday funday brunch moving forward rarely in singapore am i able to say hey i got my moneys worth and without a doubt i did today our reservation was at  and we were immediately greeted with a cocktail and shown to our table i really like the vibe at manhattan very masculine very ny and cool music it was intimate and comfortable i did not fee like i was in a hotel and it had a fun feel without being completely overwhelmed our waiter was on point and literally every time my glass started to become even close to empty he was right there asking what else we needed a make your own they had a bartender make it bloody mary that was very impressive with an entire room filled with everything you would want for your cocktail we also sampled a few of the other drinks that were good beer and wine white and red came with the brunch the seafood spread was really impressive with lobster scallops shrimp cocktail oysters and king crab legs they also had hot dishes delivered as well in addition a full spread of cheeses meat bagels breads jams dips butters and everything in between also carved beef and do not even get me started on the desserts also they had a baked alaska little room that was less than impressive but still a nice touch we did not leave until close to  so all of that food decadence and wine cocktails for  without a doubt i would go back obviously not something i could would do every sunday but a perfect place for a birthday or just a fun afternoon,Positive
manhattan,really really cool bar with dimly lit speak easy esq type ambience in the beautiful regent hotel you do not feel for one second like you are in a hotel bar amazing cocktails and personalized service great attention to detail only tried the tuna lettuce wrap bites and they were fantastic great music choice manager philip takes customer service to a whole new level best bar we went to in singapore,Positive
manhattan,just how gorgeous is that bar this place is all darkly lit elegance and chichiness filled with beautiful dressed up people it is firmly adult which is to say that there is a calm about here that is very beguiling to this old soul an upmarket whisky bar in the regent singapore there is also a wide menu for your choice of inebriation there is also quite a bit of intriguing sounding food on the menu though we did not have the stomach space for any of it we did nibble a little on that complimentary bowl of popcorn but it was a little stale from having sat out too long but everything sounded delicious both drinks and food and can i just say this place knows details my minty cocktail came with the cutest striped paper straw so retro and my partner is more sophisticated glass held some crazy fancy ice fancy logo ed ice it is not cheap but there is a price to pay for such exclusivity and gorgeousness the regent is a pretty old hotel which does not raise expectations but you get to the bar and it is this sleek elegant box you will know what i mean when you get there lined with a cellar on the exterior and tall black doors opening up to the perfectly lit bar one of my favorite bars for sure,Positive
manhattan,great theme and decor great drinks and good service by the staff a little pricey and out of the way from public transport but definitely worth taking time out for a visit or two,Positive
manhattan,if you are opening an f b establishment then staffing is an important consideration and given singapore is cocktail bar explosion it is an increasingly difficult one this new opening is reportedly helmed by a bartender named ricky from a san francisco bar named rickhouse no joke i have no idea who he is maybe he is a great bartender but when i visited on a saturday night i counted six dudes shaking things behind the bar and not only do i not know which of them was ricky i also do not know which of them made my drinks now i am glad that manhattan has found six dudes that know how to shake that is probably a minimum requirement but i do not know who they are and how much control is being exercised over quality what i do know is that my whiskey sour was poor and my rye old fashioned was average i also know that the two waitresses who served me were friendly but obviously knew nothing about the drinks they were serving and could not go off menu for recommendations neither of these facts inspires confidence look the bar looks absolutely amazing it is a great space i also bumped into a friend who has helmed bars around town and he assured me the drinks he had were excellent maybe being an industry insider means you can sit at the bar and choose the bartender the one you know personally but for an average punter there is simply too much risk,Negative
manhattan,walk into a time capsule of th century glamorous new york right here at manhattan regent hotel singapore this  week old bar will transport you back to the golden age of cocktails and fine drinking with its craft bartending artisanal spirits and luxurious environs there was certainly nothing run of the mill hotel bar about manhattan the  seat bar is home to the world is first in hotel rickhouse where bourbon whiskies and spirits bitters and single cask cocktails are aged in american oak barrels imported from minnesota the rickhouse is run by american bartender ricky paiva who has years of experience under his belt having worked at famed bars such as san francisco is rickhouse which does some of the rarest tastiest bourbons from around the world manhattan is rickhouse uses the solera ageing method and house blends are created by mixed fractions of the contents of the various aged spirits or cocktails we had to give the solera aged negroni  a shot and it came served with hand cut ice from a metre long showcase ice block at the bar the gin vermouth campari cocktail was citrusy with a light sweetness and very strong i was enthralled by nyc neighborhood inspired cocktails which are accompanied with gourmet bites that are reflective of each neighborhood and the melting pot cultures they represent i was naturally drawn to the upper east side and soho but wall street and harlem was appealing as well cocktails are priced from  to  and the fixed beverage menu will change every quarter on the upper east side we had the millionaire  plantation jamaica  rum cedilia acai liqueur albicocca apricot brandy fresh lime and house made grenadine the ingredients and house made syrups are not kept for more than two days to ensure freshness the princess cut  is a delicate g vine floraison gin june fleur de vigne liqueur fresh lemon rose water and champagne the rebellion burgers  is absolutely ues in terms of its quality and taste juicy angus beef patty served with a pungent but delicious tomato onion jam artisan nicosia cheese and butter lettuce sandwiched in a buttered and toasted paprika bun is it worth  bucks for  little bites well the boys said yes non meat eaters could have the tempting maine lobster roll  or veggie burger on wall street where life is bold and wild and never dull i had the new york sour  st george bourbon ruby port house made lavender maple syrup fresh lemon plum bitters i did not quite taste the lavender maple syrup but it was a delicious drink nonetheless pair this with the charging bull  a petit filet with bourbon apple puree wall street served us the big apple cheesecake  i noted the irony when  baby philadelphia cream cheese apple mousse appeared on crunchy vanilla sable the rum infused apple cheese mousse is encased in a thin gelatin coating interesting but we would price it at  it is quite a stretch for  if you are up for something special take the manhattan guided tour  with its tableside trolley service to create a special cocktail blending rare spirits with artisanal vermouths and bitters i would certainly be frequenting manhattan bar before it goes too mainstream like  hong kong street for a celebratory after work drink manhattan bar serves complimentary raine laws gourmet sandwiches during their violet hour now please excuse me while i have my drink,Positive
manhattan,had our monthly fridays after five here and we had a table of  near the door i feel like every online magazine and what to do site basically printed their pr sheet wholesale so this is my impression of the bar in plain english ill start with the good this is in essence a hotel bar dressed like it wants to be well a grand old den kind of reminds me of the yale club on vanderbilt ave but filled with wide eyed hotel guests and boring couples putting it out there because some people go to bars for things other than drinks so just saying there is a library of liquors up front with vats of good stuff which is an interesting visual i spent some time looking at the bar shelves too and they have a wide range of dark and white hards it is spacious enough that you do not have to elbow someone unintentionally elements that i did not like wait service is very impersonal i mean blah blah blah whatever the concept is if you do not have good table hosts i am talking basic stuff like can you explain the menu what is good here what should i get if i like something that is sweet sour with xx your customers are not going to get it whatever it may be that is how several people at my table felt when trying to order i decided to try my luck at the bar with the bartenders took a seat and was only attended to after awhile and no i was not poking my phone or anything guy with a mustache asked if i had been served i said no he asked what i would like and i said something sour gin base and he grabbed another bartender told him to make a stranger and walked off  mins later the other bartender just plonked the drink in front of me and asked if i wanted to open a tab i think i have been spoiled by jigger and bar stories but i am used to having my drink explained at the very least when it is  the drink was muddled at best i tasted some bitters yea do not really know what to say it is opening week so i am not sure who they are targeting for the crowd but it had very out of towner feel hence my hotel bar bottom line i am sure the usual bespoke bar crowd will come through once but otherwise the vibe was off is it just me or is the layout and decor a bacchanalia dj vu there are a ton of bars in town these days so you are spoiled for choice if you want that made in house spirit liquer fruit syrup handcrafted ice chunk with a toy soldier embedded yes that is how over the top this pricey cocktail stuff has gotten personalized service from bartenders that remember your name explain their creations passionately and gorgeous decor manhattan does not stand out on the most important of those fronts their drinks and service but it does have a sweet interior i do not think i will be back unless someone is buying and giving me a lift to that end of orchard,Negative
manhattan,i will make it short i was there twice now the food is great try the burgers hotdogs and the apple pie good bourbon and whiskey selection it is fun watching the bartenders and if you are interested in fact around drinks they are the right people to ask the menu is creatively designed they divide it in different parts of new york with according recommendations for drinks and food the interior is old fashion  s alike nice chill not a hang out place die to the prices but once in a while,Positive
manhattan,super chill place on weekday evenings it is a nice place to decompress and on weekends it has the let your hair down celebrate the weekend kind of vibe some interesting cocktails and i like the customized manhattan trolley service,Positive
manhattan,i was very surprised to see how lovely this bar is the atmosphere is hip and the furnishings are gorgeous being in singapore and seeing how beautiful the bar was i knew it would be pricey and i was right however it is all about the experience right we met friends for cocktails the men enjoyed three different drinks i drank champagne my biggest complaint is that every glass of champagnes was not very cold honestly bubbly should be ice cold i should have said something but i did not our waitress was quick and attentive they serve delicious salty sweet spicy popcorn that our table could not quit eating go to manhattan for the atmosphere it is lovely,Positive
brewerkz,not amazing of course but a very solid choice if you are looking for some quality beers and an american style burger and find yourself in the district loved the beer flights they had a large number of beers brewed in house available which were excellent i enjoyed the lighter stuff and the porter there was more in the ipa range which is not my thing do not forget the growlers though good supply of stuff to go,Positive
brewerkz,long time customer but i am done food is not very good anymore prices seem to go up every time i come here too bad because this was a great spot,Negative
brewerkz,sucks used to be my go to place now service is terrible cannot sit at the bar cause the fans blow all the taste off your food staff is not helpful spicy hawaiian pizza is gone now gotta pay for jalapenos new design is terrible,Negative
brewerkz,from the looks of the reviews it should be a good place first off the beers are not much in terms of craft watered down in my opinion and mostly flavorless the staff was slow sloooooooooow the food oh boy i was up all night due to a stomach ache after eating here i had the all bacon burger i could only stomach a few bites and  hours later i am still sick to my stomach while the vibe in this area is cool i would avoid it hate to give bad reviews and probably would not if i was not still sick,Negative
brewerkz,the beer is ok and most of the food is fried the beer was alright it is an average restaurant but a great place to hang out with friends and toss back a few cold ones,Positive
brewerkz,came here as a last stop before we left the country excited to try out local craft beer we were left quite disappointed the beer tasted watered down and not much flavor in any of the beers we tried the location was great and the view was nice the service was fantastic but the price was quite high compared to the rest of the country however for the area it was comprable,Negative
brewerkz,brewerkz finally a brewery i have been all over looking and finally we found one right on the river dope the beer selections are delicious try the red and the honey bee the red might have been my favorite a flight is  i am upset we did not try any food besides the chicken sticks because those were delicious cannot imagine anything else being anything but delicious they served them with a peanut dipping sauce that was everything to me they have a gift shop area where i got a hat for  and a bottle opener for  perfect place for me i felt right at home,Positive
brewerkz,this place is right by the water a nice view and good people watching we just had a beer here the food looked pretty western the beers here were also expensive s  i had a blackberry wheat ale it was good and had a nice fruit flavor good for a stop but expensive,Positive
brewerkz,i really respect what this business is trying to do bring craft beer to singapore which is something of a desert when it comes to finding good beer however the beer here is absolutely heinous their wheat beer tastes like a lager or a pilsner their black raspberry ale tastes like stomach acid i know i know i should have avoided the exotic fruit beer lesson learned the only good things about brewerkz are the happy hour prices before pm the nice view from the riverfront location and the relatively friendly and helpful staff i pray that the proprietors spend more time improving the flavor of the beer but until then it will just be another unmemorable riverfront beerhall catering to clueless ang mo tourists,Negative
brewerkz,the beer is flat out amazing especially the raspberry sour beer we love their burgers and food great for an authentic american meal the service is top notch,Positive
brewerkz,came here after getting pissed off at da luca see my previous review and wow the place was wonderful upon arrival staff were super polite and friendly immediately directed us to a table although  seconds earlier they had said wait  minutes we did not know what to eat so we asked for recommendations and boy were they quick to advertise some of the cheaper yet nicer foods on the list we had succulent beef steak a meat plate and nachos yummy the nachos were perfect and along with the guacamole the sides and the cheese it was perfectly heaven all i can say the beef was juicier than expected and boy was it yummy the tender beef sliced easily and we savored every single mouthful craving for more every time until we ran out of beef on our plate the meat platter consisted of chicken leg and pork i did not try the pork as i did not feel it but i tried the chicken the skin is very very spicy and wonderful was the meat it was like eating a kfc but like  chickens in one bite we also had the golden ale which was very good and enjoyable and will definitely be enjoyed by everyone overall just go stop reading this get out of the house and go now,Positive
brewerkz,awesome beer many selections the view is nice and the service was great would recommend if you like beer in a relaxed atmosphere,Positive
brewerkz,i cannot believe i have not reviewed this place before i have been here since it first opened a couple decades ago was but a wee lad not even legal but still stealing sips off my parents sample flights over the years on my craft beer journey i have both loved and loathed this place but i reckon i love this place more than loathe it but first the sore points unless you are here for a lunchtime pint this place gets packed make reservations crowd is varied from knowledgeable locals to expats definitely a must visit if you have only got a few days and are hankering for a good beer this is one of the first few micro breweries in singapore and is pretty much the defining local micro beers tend towards the maltier more drinkable end of the spectrum and are great for novices looking to get their feet and palates wet without having to plump for more expensive bottles beers are relatively reasonably priced too which is a huge bonus here alcohol is generally quite pricey thanks to various taxes the golden ale is a nice one to start with eminently drinkable and lovable seasonal brews populate the draught list but my old standbys are the oatmeal stout and hopback ale there is also an ok list of bottled imports well worth exploring if you are looking for something beyond the house brews on to food the menu has seen several makeovers over the years but quality can be inconsistent nonetheless it is fairly decent bar grub tending towards the american side of things think burgers and thin crust pizza still good for satisfying a beer induced hunger just do not expect michelin starred cuisine service is equally spotty and the good servers do not stay that long still staff are knowledgeable ish about the beer and the food which is far more than i can say about many other f b establishments in singapore all in though brewerkz has been a constant presence in the local f b scene as well as being a pioneer in the local craft beer movement it is one of my favourite haunts and i hope it becomes one of yours,Positive
brewerkz,nice outdoor seating area by the water with a decent selection of beers ciders and cocktails,Positive
brewerkz,i stumbled upon brewerkz while looking to get a drink why we waited to eat dinner at jumbo seafood and to my surprised it was a brewery which i wish was code that way on yelp thought we were just hitting a bar i love trying local craft beer and particular i am a fan of samplers which brewekz offers which was awesome it is such a great way to try a bunch of beer to find one you actually want to invest in drinking and since drinks in general are pricey i found in singapore nothing would be worse than being stuck with something you do not like that you paid a lot for the beers i tired were on the hoppier side not typically my style but i can appreciate them and way better than a tiger for sure the brew pub is along clarke quay with a nice waterfront view,Positive
brewerkz,well i just had to find a local microbrewery in singapore and success haha it only took me three days besides that this place is in a really cool area called riverpoint so it is right on the water and has really sweet outdoor seating we sat inside though so we did not melt and it was glorious ac on blast first of all the place had somewhat of an unique american micro pub feel with all of the art and decor then the burgers subs and pizza options on the menu brought it all together it was really nice to get that at home feel in singapore for a little it was a sunday afternoon so i had a chance to try a few of the beers all microbrews that were brewed on site first was the wheat   wheat is my favorite kinda beer and i can be a little critical with these it seemed like they tried too hard with this one and the attempt to infuse some hops in left me a little confused then i had the golden ale   this was by far the winner crisp aromatic and medium bodied with refreshing aftertaste they nailed it with this one and you should definitely give it a try finally the irish red ale   the color and consistency was a little off but the aroma and taste were spectacular very refreshing overall in hindsight i wish i did the flight sampler but they do offer smaller ml options so that you are not hammered if you want to go in on  beers over the course of your meal the best time to go  pm after pm the prices start shooting up trust me oh yeah the cowboy burger was cooked spot on with the way i asked and very very flavorful i was delightfully surprised brioche bun two thumbs up enjoy ian m,Positive
brewerkz,brewerkz great beer selection if you are a beer person this is a valid place to visit i believe some if not all were locally made food is average vegetarian options are available i had the margherita pizza good crust and appropriate cheese sauce ratio location is perfect right next to the river short walk from robertson quay and clarke quay so you can continue your drinking at clubs or bars nearby great for smokers hah music could not hear because of the ambient noise so not great i would say the price overall is more affordable than most other bars oh also they have a billiard pool table not sure which one you can tell i am no expert it is two dollars per game i would recommend if you are looking to entertain colleagues in a less formal setting enjoyed the experience overall would be nice if they fixed the music though,Positive
brewerkz,why i have not reviewed this place even after visiting multiple times is something i do not quite know so time to make amends located conveniently at a ten minute walk from the clark quay mrt and right on the water this place gets seriously packed once pm rolls around so if you have to wait more than  minutes for a table that should not come as a surprise although if you are not hung up on tables there is always place at the bar this place has been featured in many f b blogs and is touted as the ringleader for bringing the microbrewery culture to singapore and i am not surprised that is one of the accolades they have all of their in house brews are very very good right from ipa is to the stouts to the honey apricot mead all very very good if you are looking for other non house brews you will find those too along with a list of mixed drinks and mocjtails and the non alcoholic beverages all in all a bar well stocked coming to the food there is really no way you can go wrong with ordering anything off the menu since its all pretty standard american fare from chips drenched in cheese sauce and chilli to their monster creation the king brew burger only thing i would suggest is order as needed portion sizes are pretty big and you may find yourself staring at the other half of your burger or thin crust pizza torn between gluttony and being a civil person and not eating it all the dessert menu seems good toughie never quite had a chance to try it all in all a good place to visit for a very relaxed atmosphere on the water   will recommend   will revisit,Positive
brewerkz,after many a meal at hawker centres my friend and i decided that some wings were what we were missing in our lives after all one can never have too many wings unless you are a bird then that might be problematic anyway solid wings decent ipa this is singapore so you expect to pay more than you would in the us i am glad i came here once but probably not again if i am in the country,Positive
brewerkz,great spot i had a burger that was very good and the beer there was great definitely try the mussels to start too,Positive
brewerkz,this is strictly for the beer the beer is good and cold especially nice on a hot day i tried the sample set and they were all pretty good nothing totally spectacular but if did please me to sit back people watch and enjoy some beer service is good place is spacious next time i will try some food,Positive
brewerkz,i sat at the bar solo and was promptly ignored by the bartender whom i later learned is named kingsley after about ten minutes he decided i was worth his time and stood in front of me and stared his stare basically said you want drink or not i ordered my drink he went away i grabbed a menu from behind the bar because i feared waiting for kingsley to give me the menu would result in me starving to death kingsley came back my gin and tonic was well made no complaints there i ordered the closest thing to a paleo burger on the menu no bun but it came with fries and i was told really grunted at by kingsley that there was no option to switch out the fries for something else the burger and fries arrived for s  it was far overpriced even by singapore standards the burger was small but came with avocado tomato and lettuce and tasted just fine as did the french fries that i was unable to get a substitute for all in all i would never go back here never the terrible service was completely unacceptable even by singapore standards the prices were too high as well there are lots of options at clarke quay i would suggest trying someplace else,Negative
brewerkz,wanna a break from asian food this is your place i had a very good wagu beef burger and a their house brewed pale ale try their great selection of awarded craft beers by the river,Positive
brewerkz,good selection of beers good bar tender great location best part was happier hour in the early afternoon then happy hour in the late afternoon we would go back for sure,Positive
brewerkz,hung out with my friends here and we ordered a tower of beer for  pretty decent considering beer prices for a pint is around   we also ordered a chocolate brownie which took so long to come we almost forgot we ordered it the atmosphere is pretty nice right next to the river and a great place to chill and chat with friends service is also decent too i would recommend it if you prefer a quieter scene compared to the crowd and noise at clark quay,Positive
brewerkz,on the way back to our hotel we dropped by for a drink in the evening sat outside over looking the river nice view prompt friendly service i had the singapore sling which was good my husband tried one of the many beers they have place was busy and had a good vibe to it,Positive
brewerkz,do you like beer brewerkz is the place for cheap beers power hour is between pm and pm monday is to thursday is  beers on other days they vary from  to  a pint depending on the time of day all soft drinks are  and unlimited refills,Positive
brewerkz,after a very disappointing visit to the acid bar near sommerset mrt with bulmers cider with ice cubes and cocktails without alcohol we turned to the brewerkz for some speciality beer products after some single hop specialities and a ipa we took the chance to try out the remaining  flavors to end the night with the ipa which was really a treat after some days enduring tiger beer very friendly staff and fabulous view over clark quay or maybe it was just my company who made this a very enjoyable evening,Negative
brewerkz,stopped by night of the th lots of open tables was told their was none available dont understand the rejection no one in my party was intoxicated poorly dressed or attitude issues,Negative
brewerkz,if you are thirsty and need some or lots of beer to cool you down from singapore is humid weather here is an excellent place for you to visit brewerks has a variety of beer for you to choose from with a wide selection of food to match the fiery buffalo wings will wake your pallets and when you cannot stand the spice just wash it down with more beer to save some cash go during happy hour a tower costs only  dollars cannot find a better deal than that,Positive
brewerkz,finally found a good burger in singapore and the beer is really good if you can afford beer in sg  a pint after pm really liked the denali single hop pale ale bistro burger blue cheese and mushrooms,Positive
brewerkz,i have been coming to this establishment for  years it has some fine beers an excellent location and a tasty menu if only i could get served i recently ponied up to the bar on my way to my apartment in robertson quay last week around pm i caught the barman is eye as i sat on the stool at the bar and he even pushed the menu in my direction then proceeded to ignore me for the next  minutes drying glasses filling table orders talking with the wait staff i waved nodded smiled nothing i left after  dry frustrating minutes note to self come here in a bigger group and sit at a table single middle aged men at the bar no matter how thirsty wont get served maybe i need to tip more than usual i am going to try red dot again,Positive
brewerkz,burger perfect coked and excellent beer  recommended home made beer best choice good place to hangout with friends,Positive
brewerkz,the brewerkz at river point is quick becoming my de facto beer hub here is the reasons why  excellent beer there is a rotating selection of beers on tap to meet all tastes unless ur a fan of heineken carlsberg tiger etc  great view if you grab a table riverside you can watch the taxi tour boats meander by fun to people watch here  damn good beer their x ipa won a gold medal and is   abv need i say more  very reasonable prices for a pint at happy hour and after  yes there is good food for a brewery tried the nachos supreme and it was spot on  there is a beer fridge with  ml bottles and mini kegs available for take out at really good prices never go home empty handed from this place i did check in at the other brewerkz popping up around town and the fridge selection is spotty riverside never disappoints though,Positive
brewerkz,moving from seattle i would miss the craft beers from home brewerkz however delivers some really decent brews and american grub i started off with the hoppy monk which was deceivingly a dark beer but very good i also tried the black pig which also packed a punch the smaller burger was more than enough and sure it is expensive by the us standards and the presentation was uninspiring for a  burger but seems in line for singapore and more importantly tasted quite good the one thing that was especially interesting was the beer pricing which depends on the tier of beer there are  types one being more expensive and when you buy it  different blocks of time also just go for the ml as it is usually just  more that then ml it is a no brainer,Positive
brewerkz,nice beers and the food was good pizza i recommend was not bad for ap for sure so glad i found this spot,Positive
brewerkz,i did not eat here so i cannot rate the food from a taste perspective but everything i saw running by looked really good the xipa is worth the visit alone for all you ipa lovers staff was super friendly and prices compared to other places i have gone to thus far were reasonable,Positive
brewerkz,if you are looking for good beer brewerkz is the place to go you can choose to sit outdoors by the riverside or indoors where there is a pool table frankly i am not a big fan of beer and even their is weetest beer tastes quite bitter to me i guess this place will be great for people who are into authentic beer which are always bitter this is a good place for guys to go to it is a magnet for men there is a tv that shows soccer channels a huge variety of beer and meaty food the servings are quite large and filling there is plenty of seats around so it is a great place to hang out with friends as well,Positive
brewerkz,great beer selection covering many styles having had beer all over the world they hold pretty true to the respective styles they are brewing i was here a number of years ago during thanksgiving    month trip and they threw a full american thanksgiving dinner with all the fixings i will support them whenever i am in town,Positive
brewerkz,good pub fare nice beer selection might not be the best in the world but they have something enjoyable for everyone great atmosphere and scenic outside area its the kind of place you can spend hours hanging out with friends drinking without feeling crowded or bored,Positive
brewerkz,i used to always come here to feel a sense of home american burgers pool table free flowing beer however i always come away disappointed with the food mainly because i do not believe in paying over twenty dollars for burgers that just taste like condiments i admit i should probably learn to ask to have the condiments on the side but i also believe that great burger joints know how much blue cheese or ketchup to put in its burgers i still frequent this place but no longer for the food my advice for this place come here for the affordable borderline cheap beer and not the overpriced food,Negative
brewerkz,not great and not awful this place gets a lot of hype but it is just ok the beer is the saving grace as the food is sub par i know my review is opposite to most but if you are looking for a cool bar experience then try a more local or intimate location if you want a chain then this is your spot haha,Negative
brewerkz,star food  star beer oh yea and a great view too came here with a big group of about  people so got a good sampling of all the different beers and food my favorite was definitely the seasonal black raspberry ale,Positive
brewerkz,i just got back from a great lunch at brewekrz to the new american residents of the island this is soon to be an important landmark of singapore brewerkz plays host to the best american quiz night american association events and really great beer but its not exclusive to americans i just say this to give you a reference point for the atmosphere and food i sat on the terrace this afternoon with a beer friend and has the pulled pork sandwich which was delicious i opted for the caesar side salad the bbq sauce was a little sweeter than i would like it but the pork was juicy and flavorful i normally set aside the bun but they make their own sourdough so i ate more than half of it great way to spend an afternoon i can also recommend the burgers and chicken wings,Positive
brewerkz,i really wish that brewerkz did not serve american fare along with its american sized portions perhaps it appeals to a certain demographic in singapore but having lived there and now returning as a foreigner it felt a little too pretentious and it was not even that great the food really is their downfall along with the slow service but service is never really a priority in singapore luckily their beers are pretty tasty come here for the beer and do not bother with the food there is way too much other good food to eat in singapore between the two of us we tried the golden ale oatmeal stout honey apricot ale blonde assassin pilsner and the summer ale from red dot they were all refreshing smooth and tasty do not worry we got the sampler not binge drinking the location itself is pretty nice right by the river and the interior is interesting next time i am in singapore i would prefer to try other microbreweries as they did not leave too great of an impression to beckon me to return,Positive
brewerkz,went here because our two other choices were booked out big mistake food was underwhelming and the prices were insane eg i ordered fried chicken i got a whole chicken deep fried not cut up whole on the plate impossible to handle in a restaurant setting and flavorless to boot not much finesse there i normally stay away from clarke quay and places like this are the reason why,Negative
brewerkz,if you need want american food and beer this is the place the beer is solid as is the food the burgers are a nice connection to home i really enjoy just sitting and watching all of the people go by,Positive
brewerkz,a saturday afternoon visit to clarke quay landed us at brewerkz we took the lunch promo that included a ml of draught beer the black pig is amazing followed shortly by a   pulled pork sandwich simply put delicious,Positive
brewerkz,brewerkz was the microbrewery back when everybody still drank bottled beer like it was the shit i do not know if it was the first but they were certainly instrumental in bringing a fun large collegial microbrewery with its own interesting beers here the happy hours are tiered the earlier you come the cheaper it gets i guess it gives away how old i am to note that i used to skip college to come drink here for something if my memory does not fail me old woman that i am the food as many have pointed out is okay some of my american friends who came recently thought it had the best burger they have had in this part of the world that may well be because i did not get to take them to de burg but i am glad they had fun anyway the food is reasonably portioned quite large and the overall brewerkz experience is usually fun and somewhat pricey but not too much,Negative
brewerkz,if you are looking for a good beer spot with decent grub brewerkz is a good place to head to the riverside outlet is quite large and has al fresco seating by the singapore river so you can do some people watching while you eat try and get here during happy hour which stops at pm beer is their specialty the golden ale is a failsafe for me but they always introduce new flavours so you can change it up the fruitbrewz can also be good depending on the fruit they have beer samplers if you cannot decide what you like the food is quite hearty i usually go for the buffalo wings if you go for spicy it is spicy and the calamari the fish and chips is a good option too there is a pool table and a tv with sports during soccer season it gets packed so overall a nice place to chill out at,Positive
brewerkz,brewerkz it is a foolproof place to get a bunch of people out to sit and chit chat and waste time talking nonsense spending time together on a weekend i enjoyed the easy breezy atmosphere the last time i went it is a break from the noisy tight places at clarke quay my colleague told me the mussels here are good but i do not eat shell stuff so cannot give a verdict on that there is a huge selection of beer my companion ordered a german beer which i thought felt lighter but not that smooth on the throat well i am not a regular beer drinker so yeah the service was good the waiter was friendly and they did not prevent me from bringing my mineral water into the picture do not laugh check out eatlikeawhale blogspot sg for more pictures and reviews,Negative
brewerkz,my colleagues and i decided to come here one day after work to chill out this is one of the more popular joints around and we were rather fortunate to be able to get a place here anyway we ordered a variety of pub food ranging from mussels burgers and steak the mussels here are really good they are cooked with beer which makes them really juicy and tender they also serve garlic bread together with this and i feel that the two really go very well with each other my friend had the rib eye steak and he mentioned that it was somewhat chewy and perhaps not tender enough for him of course everyone comes here for the beer and i feel that the beer here is nice but probably not more special than other places still this is no doubt one of the best places to chill out in town with friends,Positive
brewerkz,used to go to brewerkz quite a bit in the past but it got eclipsed by some other great bars i finally went back again the other day and found things to be pretty much the same food wise the portions are generous and not bad it is mostly western stuff so you will probably get the burgers or fish i cannot think of any outstanding dishes that you must try though the main reason to come here is the beer they have their own unique and interesting beers and some are pretty good new flavours are also introduced every now and then making repeated visits more probable i prefer the outdoor sitting more than the indoor one as you can sit by the river and watch the evening go by,Positive
brewerkz,this is where you go for beer and huge portions i have been told that their burgers and steaks are good but i am usually there for the finger food having been scared off by a cobb salad so large that two people neither of whom shy grazers could comfortably eat if you are looking for a place to host an event brewerkz is a good spot too lots of room for functions and a helpful staff to arrange details for you,Positive
brewerkz,best american style brew pub experience in singapore a taste of home,Positive
brewerkz,pretty good place for a good burger used to come here with my family but it was also very expensive and at the time there were not a lot of places to get a good burger so we were stuck,Positive
brewerkz,finally draft micro brew in singapore nice place out side seating dint get to try the food but good selection on the menu,Positive
brewerkz,come here for the beers and finger food they have a wide selection of beers and i have got too many likes amongst the variety to actually name a favourite drop by in the afternoon on weekends for lunch for insanely cheap beer cheaper than your tiger beer in the kopitiam,Positive
brewerkz,doing a self guided beer tour and this seems to be home base have  more stops but the black pig has me by the tail a bit pricey but ya get what u pay for,Positive
brewerkz,this is singapore is best brewpub at least it is the closest things i have found to the american craft beer scene their beers are good but fairly monochromatic at least in the malt profile it is as if they start with the same stock recipe and modify it to fit different styles a little lighter for the golden more hops for the ipa add honey for the mad bee throw in some dark malts for the black pig i like their stout but it is a little wimpy for my taste they should follow jungle beer is lead on that one the kiasu stout is good that may sound more critical than i intended like i said their beer is nice not particularly adventurous but satisfying they are a little expensive during peak times but they have a complicated sliding scale on the prices they get incrementally more expensive throughout the day but go before pm good for an after lunch beer on a saturday and you get a pint for  bucks hard to beat oh and check out their bottle list if you love american craft beer like i do you have to come here for beers that do not exist anywhere else in singapore today they had alesmith is brown ale lost abbey is devotion and russian river is damnation i do not know how they got them those guys do not export so maybe there is some kind of craft beer black market but you wo not catch me complaining,Positive
brewerkz,huge selection of draft beers we did two of the flights and ended up tasting   beers during our evening here loved many liked some did not like some but with so many options you are sure to find something that suits your fancy they have lovely seating on the river we did not get food so i cannot comment on the menu i was a bit cranky that beer was twice as expensive at the time that we went as it would have been  hours earlier this sliding price scale is not something i am familiar with in the states if i go back i would make it an early afternoon trip and drink twice as much beer for the same price,Negative
brewerkz,good choice of tasty home brewed draught beers as lager ipa pilsner klsch and many many more very nice location at the river with view to clarke quay common pub food as burgers pizza fish chips etc,Positive
brewerkz,if you are a beer lover this place boasts a delightful selection of local brewed beers brewerkz beers on tap and a huge selection of beers all over the world from the united states they have stone beers lagunitas lost abbey and alesmith pretty impressive the place is huge and resembles an american brew pub with pool tables and dark wood interiors a nice place to chill out on a weekend especially in the afternoon since the beer prices increases from early hours to night we got a pint of beer before  at  bucks not too shabby the bar food unfortunately was not a hit for me in general the bar food was greasy without offering great flavors go for the beer,Positive
brewerkz,update i do not attend the trivia any more and the menu has changed and devolved no delicious mac and cheese veggie burger is a joke of a frozen patty sadness dropping one star because it is still a nice place to gather a crowd for a drink snack brewerkz hosts my favorite pub trivia every week on tuesdays this quiz is in the restaurant but separate from the main floor area so regular patrons do not have to be involved and we can be how we like in the back dining area consequently i have eaten here a lot and have tried almost everything vegetarian on the menu my favorite is the macaroni and cheese which is  sgd so i try not to get it but it is a decent portion and delicious so sometimes i cave pizzas are filling if not the most delicious pizzas and probably the best value item felafel burger is similarly underwhelming and filling the salads are not worth the price unless you are getting meaty ones i suppose the berry crumble brownie and bread pudding desserts are all good but do not bother with anything cake y in general most things are overpriced for what they are no comment on the beers i am afraid as i do not drink them however one of the few places in singapore that has free refills on their soft drinks  sgd which is nice as a place it is pretty good service and a nice venue to hang out in big groups as there is lots of room both inside and out,Positive
brewerkz,in  an american businessman decided to open some north american style brew pub sports bar eateries in singapore there are a couple of restaurants but this one is prime riverside location it is very large and often very busy with expats putting back tasty burgers buffalo wings pizzas racks of lamb and pint after pint of cold handcrafted beer i did not eat the food to be honest if i am visiting singapore i am not interested in eating cheeseburgers and chili fries it is also a bit too touristy for my tastes the size of the place and the beer brewed on site by the river though make it an excellent place to fight the heat of a sweltering hot singaporean afternoon go for the beers,Positive
brewerkz,located just outside the nightlife center of singapore clarke quay brewerkz riverside offers you the best breweries perfect for chilling out before after your clubbing night it is beautifully located just by the singapore river you should try the singapore slings the pride of singaporean cocktails,Positive
brewerkz,brewerkz do the best burgers in singapore they have just opened a smaller outlet at upper bukit timah road the concept of brewing bear in house creates a strong social atmosphere for people to meet prices are a little steep and beer can be purchased in a glass to huge dispensers their mega burgers are about sgd however their standard one would suffice there are more cultural places to visit for tourists but if you have the time or live in singapore it is worth the visit,Positive
brewerkz,favorite hangout for expats in singapore nice environment good for a pint of beer any day fridays are crowded but still manageable,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,i am still wishing i can eat this bean curd now sigh so silky and smooth lightly sweetened to perfection if you like bean curd this is amazing they come in original and almond flavor both mouthwatering texture is perfect it is all premade and you can get extra to go found in the first row when you walk in to the maxwell hawker center,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,i tried their almond and regular flavored bean curb they were pre sweetened and a bit to bland for my taste they were okay but not great the price for the regular flavor in nov  was sg  and sg   for almond flavor it is a good value but hold your expectations down a bit,Negative
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,honestly the best soy milk and tofu pudding dou fa that i ever had i wish a place like this existed in toronto when i was in singapore we made it a priority to come here the first attempt when we went the shop was closed the second time it was open and we bought soy milk and tofu pudding and after trying it we instantly bought more because it just so good,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,i was very surprised with this tiny sweet treat it was soft textured like tofu but lightly sweet and healthy treat it was good on its own but i can also see myself adding a few more sweet milks fruits and such there were also other stalls that sells this as a drink form with boba or grass jelly,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,i heard about this place from a yelper allene t that i follow i only got the original beancurd for   sgd the beancurd tofu dessert does not come with syrup on the side since it was already sweetened the beancurd was silky smooth and delicious i never had anything like this before definitely give this place a try when you are at maxwell food centre,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,tried this at the old airport food centre location original flavor   was wonderful the beancurd was firm but not too firm perfectly sweet but not too sweet yum there was a happy beancurd stall two stalls away which was selling the same thing for   buy one get one free being a cheapskate i challenged my wife that she could not taste the difference and we should buy the one that was half the price we did a blind taste test and she could tell the difference immediately,Negative
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,i  agree with the rest of the reviewers i visited maxwell food centre as a tourist and had lao ban for the second day in a row that is how good this stuff is i am not sure if there is an original store but the two that i tried old airport taste exactly the same and are equally amazing in taste see lao ban old airport review here yelp com biz lao ban soy i went ahead and got the regular flavor preferred over almond and had it during the middle of my meal who needs to wait to eat dessert price is   sgd and there was no line whatsoever on a weekday evening,Negative
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,life changingly good growing up eating this stuff for dessert i was alway mehhhhh about tofu for dessert but man i have changed my mind after trying lao ban is dessert to be honest we were eating tian tian chicken and sat down right in front of lao ban is stall having a couple coins from change received from tian tian is and seeing some folks buy bags and bags of tofu i decided to give it a try first bite amazing the tofu is so soft and smooth and not overly sweet a purchase of one turned into a purchase of many i brought the extras back to the hotel and ate them the rest of my stay in singapore i am glad i went out on a limb and gave this place a try,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,i still remember the first time i actually had lao ban tau huay a friend bought it for me and i was really skeptical about how good it would taste there is so much rave and craze over this cold dessert and it got me thinking what is sooooo magical about it and indeed when i first tasted it i had that magical moment lao ban beancurd unlike the usual traditional ones is served cold and has a pudding like texture i know there is this lao ban style beancurd recipe that is being spread online but it does not seem like anyone has achieved the golden balance as yet it is definitely not easy to achieve the pudding texture and then when you start eating it all the soya milk start oozing out okay i am not too good at describing it but you get the point the bottom line is it is delicious after trying it i finally understand why the queue is so long there are two flavors that you can choose from original and almond usually i will just go for the original even my overseas friends enjoyed this a lot when they came over here however i do feel that they can make a little improvement by introducing a not so sweet recipe as the regular ones taste a tad too sweet to some,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,this is the most amazing thing i ever ate i would literally go back to singapore just to eat this again i got the original flavor and the taste and texture was so perfect,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,the best  i have ever had very smooth light not too sweet fresh tasting at   it is a steal jonasapproved,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,meh enough with the formalities prim and proper attitude and masked phrases i am just going to be a straight out bugger for this review you are not singaporean if you have never done your time in national service if you are a guy that is ladies exempt or if you have not had a fix from lao ban soya beancurd choose any stall this one just happens to be my poison of choice of course if you are allergic to soy i would let it slide but hey pop a zyrtec and i am sure you can have one small bowl at least it is worth it come on i do that when i am about to have shrimp knowing hives are a comin so yeah if i have to tell you one soy product that is actually worth eating despite the endless genetic mutations this particular crop has gone through nowadays i would swear by this little bowl of silky smooth awesomeness not to mention it was one of few places i had to have a mini binge before my way out of good ol is g if you are wondering the tally was  bowls if you have lived in singapore for some time now and have not had this yet i will i will i will call the cops on you yelp    my last  weeks in sg,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,this tofu tastes like heaven it is so smooth and silky i have never tasted anything like this so simple yet so delicious wish they have this at the states,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,this is probably the best beancurd you can get in singapore good thing is that they started expanding with several outlets in various districts,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,look it is a bird it is a plane no it is a giant inexplicable queue ok so this is not that unusual in singapore neither is a stall that basically serves a single item nor a queue that begins before the stall even opens the  is still excellent though it was not quite what i expected having seen an entirely different concoction while living in taiwan with the same name but it would not be a stretch to say it redeemed mostly plain tofu sweet without being sickly so a snack that one can consume without guilt unless one starts building a pile of empty plastic containers of course between here and tian tian one can end up waiting for a long time at maxwell food centre but if one is singapore i figure it is just part of the cultural experience to participate in one of the national sports queuing is a singaporean national sport right,Negative
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,a must try a local favorite hot spot for this soft tofu dessert located in hawker locations of singapore made with very soft tofu served in hot cold with sweet ginger water so when you are in the singapore area be sure to make a trip to taste this refreshing dessert,Positive
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,located along old airport road this humble stall in old airport food center has been serving tow huay to the neighbourhood for ages it has been well known for their silky smooth tow huay it has two stalls in the food center and you might be lucky to find one of them with no one queuing however if you visit them during peak hours be prepared to see a long queue they should not be hard to spot they serve different flavours almond and original are the most popular flavour there was this weird occasion where someone who queue  minutes and ordered only one tub of tow huay and the owner assistant was quite surprise though there is no minimum order you would find people ordering many tubs at one shot as mentioned the tow huay is refreshing and melts in your mouth you would want to have another as one tub is just not enough,Negative
lao-ban-soya-beancurd,as a person addicted to sugar highs i usually take my tao huey with sugar syrup so when i first heard about lao ban and how they do not serve the beancurd with any syrup at all i was seriously sceptical about it but one day after watching the corporate drones at raffles cbd buy them by the tens i decided to give them a try the texture of this beancurd is similar to gelatin jelly instead of normal beancurd instead of splitting into smaller pieces it melts away into a beancurd liquid in your mouth really interesting to the point where we all got addicted to this new variety and no longer prefer the old beancurd the store i patronise only offers takeaway option and is located at the raffles place mrt xchange next to the brownie factory they re stock at am and  pm each day and queues are crazy to do be early and snag a spot,Positive
