with my girlfriend to gardens by the bay and we managed to clock in   steps gigantic garden with lots of wonderful attractions my girlfriend loves flower dome but i would prefer the cloud forest floral fantasy was kind of in the middle for both of us foods though are quite limited in selection we went to marina square to have our dinner instead\",\"review is solely for the gardens an iconic landmark of singapore the gardens by the bay combine culture architecture and ingenuity that impressively represent the city state of singapore located in the heart of the city there are several areas within the garden that you can go see there are also several towers that are distinct from one another fortunately my friend from singapore had a few free passes that allowed us to go up  of the towers the fee is not exorbitant and relatively cheap there are several tours that are offered but literally everything is written in english so there is not a big problem with learning on your own every evening there is a light show for the gardens by the bay that is definitely worth watching you can see the light show from the famous marina bay sands hotel balcony either paying  for a cover charge or simply buying a drink there is a lot to explore but my favorite part of the garden was what a call the bio dome of plants essentially within a controlled sheltered environment nearly flora represented from every country was flourishing further on the hot day the bio dome was actually cold the engineering of the bio dome allows for cool air not manufactured by some giant a c pretty darn green friendly this is destination is a must but be prepared it gets hot in the day there are so many places to take a date here as well oh if only nice\",\"it is nice to see it by day to see the structure and how it is assembled if you want to see the full beauty of it see it at night it is much cooler and more rewarding to see it lighted up it is still nice to walk and meander around the area during the day and you must go up to the cloud by the forest nearby if you are already here anyways the cloud forest was mostly why i made the jaunt to the gardens it is cool to see the gardens by the bay floral homage up close too it is a nice stepping stone to see other great things\",\"wow all i can say is wow this place is amazing it is ginormous with lots of different sections to visit entry to the garden is free but it does cost extra to go up to the super tree observatories or greenhouses the place is clean and well maintained great place for romantic strolls family excursions morning jogs you name it at night gardens by the bay is transformed to a beautiful wonderland the dragonfly bridge is gorgeous and overlooks a small pond that is filled with giant colorful rubber beach balls at night it makes for such a romantic walk the supertree grove is where you definitely have to be in the evening every night there is a light show complete with orchestral music the lights glitter with the rhythm of the music and the sound system is incredible practically everyone has their heads craned upwards completely enthralled a must go for anyone visiting singapore\",\"unfortunately we did not get to see the supertrees skyway due to the rain the last two days we went here they closed the ocbc skyway observatory deck due to safety reasons i mean that is good but bad timing for us our ticket lasts  months so we will see if we come back or give it away there are no refund if we miss the opportunity to go it is unfortunate the trees were beautiful decorated with plants and flowers especially during their light show at pm you have to stay close by the area to reserve a seat to see this an hour before the light show we saw this afar and it was beautiful none the less hopefully you do not come here during the rainy season and miss this like us it would be well worth the advance purchase at least we got to see the cloud and flower domes since it is covered\",\"we came to check out gardens by the bay on a wednesday afternoon and it was not busy at all i do not know if the coronavirus was to blame or maybe because it was a weekday but it made it nice and easy for us to go through the exhibits we walked through the supertree grove first to get to the skyway it was a great view of the city but probably not recommended for those scared of heights it was a windy day also so it was a little bit scary for me on the narrower sides of the skyway i have seen photos of the supertree grove at night and i think that would be a diffferent experience but equally as magnificent as in the daytime it is a pretty short bridge but i think it is fairly priced at  sgd per person because of the amazing views we went through the cloud forest after to get out of the warm sun it had such beautiful architecture and vegetation inside it seems small at first but there are so many different levels and areas to walk through there were several other attractions here but those were the only two we had time to visit if you can carve out a full morning or afternoon i would definitely recommend it they have package deals for tickets so you can visit multiple attractions with a discounted rate as well\",\"you have to visit gardens by the bay there is really something for everyone to see here not only is it a beautiful place but it is full of culture and history here you will see plants from around the world and they tell a story they display plants and tell where they are from and the timeframes of when they originated there are also sculptures of animals from around the world and other general sculptures for kids they have a play area with water to cool down so much to see and you will learn something new along the way i ran into people from around the world here and even some that i went to college with in arizona united states\",\"gardens by the bay is every bit as cool as i was led to believe by multiple sources we skipped the ticketed sections as we were short on time but still enjoyed walking through the free public spaces getting around the park is easy with the helpful maps and there are plenty of concessions if you are feeling hungry or thirsty i had a delicious iced mocha from the coffee spot last but not least there is a taxi queue for when you are ready to move along i would love to spend more time here and check out some of the ticketed areas on a future singapore visit\",\"a gorgeous new addition to singapore is waterfront that played a role in crazy rich asians some sites like the two conservatories flower dome cloud forest and the overhead skyway connecting the supertrees charge admission but for most it is a pleasant totally free experience whether a nice walk around beautifully landscaped and well tended grounds admiring the supertrees from down below or having fun with the kids at the children is garden and water fountain there is lots for everyone to do there are even two nightly light and music shows at the supertrees it is all so pretty and stunning in fact that you would almost be excused for looking up at everything instead of keeping track of the footpath in front of you or of others all around stay alert and there should be plenty of room for all\",\"this is a must visit attraction plan to spend the whole day here and be prepared for a lot of walking the park is pretty no matter what time of the day you visit however it gets really beautiful once it gets dark and everything is lit up the park itself is free and you can walk around an enjoy quite a bit here without purchasing any ticket however i would recommend doing a couple of attractions like cloud forest flower dome or the skywalk you will need to purchase tickets for each of those you get a beautiful view of the whole city and the various attractions like marina bay sands singapore flyer and merlion from various parts of the park and do stay for the light show in the evening you will be dead tired at the end of the day but it is well worth the time spent here\",\"i was so thrilled to be back in singapore with my husband gardens was on top of our must see list and it was just as spectacular as i remembered it highlight was floral fantasy it was not open when i came in  so i was beyond excited because i love flowers i have to say it was breathtaking i think i had my mouth open walking through the garden the amount of work put in each hanging flower ball is insane hubby liked the cloud forest more the waterfall was incredible and he liked the rainforest feel inside the dome def a destination you must not miss when in sin\",\"gardens by the bay is one of the must visit attractions when visiting singapore the gardens are pretty big so there is plenty to walk around and see the best part is that most of the park is free you can choose to pay to go into the different special exhibitions and even do a skywalk on the top of the super trees if you are planning to do this it is cheaper to buy a package ticket for a few of the attractions the grounds have everything you could need there is a shuttle service that will take you around to the different areas there are plenty of bathrooms and even  different food courts for eating when visiting definitely plan to spend an entire day here the grounds are beautiful and i definitely recommend paying extra for the tickets to see the cloud forest and flower dome you should then end the day by sticking around for the light show at night which is also free grab some food at the nearby food court and pick a spot on the lawn to take in the show\",\"this was a fun activity for our trip we ate at the seafood restaurant followed by the combo pass for the flower dome and waterfall dome then walked around the garden a bit i highly recommend walking from the garden to the marina sands hotel the bridge across has a wonderful view of the iconic hotel skywheel and garden this is a free and awesome part my favorite dome was the waterfall it was really engaging rare flowers extinct in the wild carvings and even lego art mixed in some educational videos as well flower walls for instagram photo opts galore wear a bright dress i would recommend read that has plenty of movement to twirl around and get your instagram content the seafood restaurant portions are to share the prices looked really high but when split between   they are more reasonable\",\"it is one of the two must visit attractions while you are in singapore especially if you are into nature it is separate as one is a flower dome while the other is a cloud forest you can see the skyline of singapore and of the bay it was decorated with christmas displays which made it more lovely again it is must if you are in singapore\",\"a must visit the outdoor park is free itself but you have to pay to visit in the indoor gardens the cloud dome was our favourite with the indoor waterfall it was also a great spot to cool off from the brutal humidity the park features are incredible and very photo worthy especially the super trees and the cool egg floaties in the water with view of the marina bay sands in the background\",\"you would be a fool to miss this especially at night when the light show is happening the floral exhibits are ado worth seeing but either come early or late because it tends to be overcrowded\",\"literally everyone is must visit hot spot when in singapore gardens by the bay is a giant park behind marina bay sands with no admission fee i went around pm and waited until  pm to watch the light show garden rhapsody soooo beautiful it plays daily at  pm and  pm there are usually a lot of people chilling and laying on the ground to watch but i found a really good viewing spot with what i personally think has a greater view of the park this entire park is very picturesque and i did not mind walking around for a couple hours to take in its beauty towards the back of the park there is an indoor food market with lots of yummy food\",\"if you visit singapore i highly recommend coming here daytime to walk the huge garden night time to see the beautiful lights they also have attractions i chose to purchase the attraction bundle which included floral fantasy flower dome cloud forest and shuttle service to the last two the shuttle service is worth it especially after having walked the grounds of the entire garden in the  degree plus weather and enduring the high humidity the attractions are indoors in wonderfully temperature controlled man made environments there is a short little d film at the end of floral fantasy it is all beautiful for those of us who like to view different flora and fauna all in one place it is fun for the entire family each attraction exits you right into a great gift shop there is also a couple cafes located on the premises the one located right inside the flower dome looked like fun too bad i had just eaten the mrt drops you right off at the ticket booth discount for senior citizens  years and over\",\"the first thing to know about gardens by the bay is that it is one massive tourist attraction it has highly constructed facilities that you can pay to go into plus it has large gardens ponds and even a few aquariums around the property that are offered free of charge for many they find this location a great place to spend time with the family it is also a good place to get in a little exercise and walk and or run around personally for those of us who know what this area of singapore used to be like meaning those of us who are a little bit older we may remember what this area was once upon a time for me that was a much more ascetically pleasing period of time this is not to say that gardens by the bay is not a great place but i am just saying that it lacks any true singaporean culture so go here if you want to interact with a lot of tourists and see some marginally interesting tourist attractions but if you want to see what singapore is truly all about you may have to go to other locations\",\"i remember i was scrolling through a friends feed and there was a picture of him posed in front of the gardens by the bay in the background i was fascinated by the trees behind him in that picture which made me research more of singapore thus i thank my friend for planting the seed to visit singapore   years ago thanks jose in my opinion the gardens by the bay is synonymous to singapore as the same can be said about with the marina bay sands hotel they just go hand and hand together like dark chocolate dusted with sea salt together the gardens by the bay is a large park which is free to enter there is no admission to walk around the park i saw a lot of locals jogging around the park at night i cannot imagine doing that during the day that said the attractions which include the two domes the cloud forrest and flower dome and ocbc skyway are paid admission fees i encourage you to pay to see all three i only had the opportunity to see the two domes and missed the chance to go to the skyway but i was very particular as too when i wanted to go on the skyway since the paid admission is for only one usage the domes on the other hand allow you to get a re entry stamp when you exit which is valid for the entire day both the cloud forrest and the flower dome have their charm head to the flower dome if you want to immerse yourself in a bouquet of flowers from all over the world if you want to feel as if you are in a different planet go to the cloud forrest the cloud forrest also boasts having one of the largest indoor waterfalls it is a spectacular sight to witness with your own eyes explore both domes and learn about sustainability which is prevalent in the structure and urban planning of this beautify country i would encourage you to see the park both during the day and at night as the park truly gives off a different energy during both times in the evening there is a light show with the skytreees in the skytree grove that is mesmerizing note i would plan accordingly if you do go to the gardens at night last admission time for the ocbc skyway is pm also note that if there is a sign stating that there will be street food it is concession type food\",\"i think my problem going into this experience were my expectations being extremely high i have heard tons fo good feedback about tian tian is chicken and rice do not kill me for saying it but it was so so and i think that is because i sous vide my chicken at home so i am spoiled with super tender moist poultry that said i totally get for people who do not sous vide regularly how this would be a mind blowing experience super affordable great with a tiger beer but did not finish the plate thinking i needed to come back again\",\"what else has not been said about the super popular tian tian chicken and rice stall i am not sure if i can add anything else yes bourdain was here as usual he is right this quintessential singaporean dish of chicken and rice is so perfectly done that you cannot find fault in it incredibly soft chicken fragrant rice and the sauce is deliciously spiced with ginger puree i ordered a large portion s   for a large though so i could get more chicken and got the soy egg for extra protein there was not a wait when i came in at am the crowds came at lunch time when the surrounding office workers were out i am not one to stand in line for a long time and there are other chicken and rice stalls at maxwell is which are probably worth a try too\",\"there are  famous chicken rice places at maxwell and they are only a few stalls down from each other tian tian was the original and occupies stalls   the rice plate comes in small medium large the small is only   it is nice to have the option of small so you can try more stuff they also have other dishes but the rice plate is the star order at line a and pickup at line b the chicken rice is chicken breast boneless and skinless which i appreciate it is super tender the rice also has good chicken flavor warning the hot sauce sauce is hot\",\"tian tian does not make the same hainanese chicken rice dish that your mom used to make sorry mom it is true actually i cannot really say that my mom ever cooked this dish but if she had then it still would not have compared tian tian is chicken rice dish truly lives up to the legend it has become there are enough reviews detailing the deliciousness and tenderness of this dish so i will provide you with a pro tip the line here can get long quickly so plan to stop in at an off time ya know not during the typical lunch dinner rush times i stopped in early on a friday afternoon and walked right up and ordered score shortly after i sat down to wait the brief wait for my order the line grew ten plus long in a snap tian tian is definitely a must try in singapore five stars\",\"i came here on my first day in singapore and managed to skip any lines as it was about  am score for no lines at a michelin rated hawker stall went ahead and ordered their specialty hainam chicken dish i thought it was good and what snt it apart was the gravy sauce you cannot find this sauce anywhere and it is probably what gives this place the  michelin star rating after much thought i think america has spoiled me in that theres so much options and similar to many of the famous hawker stall flavors here i in singapore i would definitely recommend coming here to try the sauces hainan chicken if there is no ginormous line\",\"during my recent trip to singapore i went on a mission to find the best chicken rice tian tian recommended by the concierge at the ritz carlton was the first stop on my quest tian tian is located at the maxwell food centre a short walk from marina bay do not be alarmed at the long line it moves quickly we ordered a medium chicken rice to share but came back again the next day and ordered our own which set us back  singapore dollars   usd a total steal for lunch what makes this place so special is that they do a simple dish really well the chicken is perfectly poached soft juicy the rice is fragrant and tasty not bland like at hawker chan the chili sauce that comes with the dish is super tasty there is chili citrus probably lime a little bit of oil a perfect topping for this chicken rice dish i need to get the recipe for this chili sauce because i want to drizzle it on top of all my chicken rice meals if you are in singapore you must visit tian tian\",\"bookmarked this place so many years ago and is pretty much the only thing i know i wanted to check out in singapore haha no long lines solid chicken and flavorful rice they may keep my name\",\"born out of frugality and created by servant class immigrants trying to stretch the flavor of the chicken chicken rice dishes are a staple to singaporean cuisine i did the chicken rice challenge between tian tian hainanese chicken rice and liao fan hawker chan the ever so popular michelin guide praised one with a single star and the other was highlighted by a celebrity chef anthony bourdain rip in comparison both prices were similar and they both drew a crowd where the line can get pretty if arriving during peak hours the most significant difference between these two stands was their style one was soy sauce based while the other was a stock based if i had a vote between the two purely based on my opinion i would give my vote to this restaurant i loved the texture and the temperature of the chicken served somewhat cold while trying to beat the humidity along with the meal they served chicken broth and their house version of the hot sauce which complements well when the chicken starts to taste plain i loved this place for the price although it did not fill me up it was enough for me to have the right amount of energy to start my day\",\"there is chicken rice and then there is tian tian is chicken rice this is hands down the best chicken rice i have ever eaten the rice is flavorful with a light black sauce and chicken juice gravy over it and the chicken is perfectly moist it pairs really well with the lime based chili sauce that gives it just the right kick the store does lots of takeout orders so you can order ahead if you want to skip the line we got there just before the lunch rush on a weekday at  am or so and ended up waiting  minutes it is a well oiled machine but i would expect a wait of around  to  minutes during peak times on the bright side you can easily spot the store by the long line\",\"never eaten so delicious hainanese chicken with rice before the chicken is tender and smooth and the rice is flavoured with ginger scallion and oil it tasted awesome just to be prepared to come early to avoid long line up even so there is a very good system of collecting money on one aide and have the dishes ready on the other side\",\"rated to be one of the top places to get chicken rice in singapore so i had to try it this joint has  locations but i wanted to try the popular one that is located in the maxwell food center located on the opposite side of maxwell ave of the hawker center you will put your order in and grab a ticket you will then hand the ticket to the other window and they will serve you your food the line can queue up depending on the time especially during the lunch hour however i showed up a little before   on a tuesday and there was no wait most popular is the medium chicken rice which includes chicken the rice and the chili sauce all on a plate chicken was very moist and tender like what people said but the chili sauce is what makes it really good i highly recommend that you give this place a try although it is not my personal favorite in singapore\",\"okay so its been  years since i have been here yelp was not in singapore yet but it is still my favorite hainan chicken rice ever braving the long lines can be problematic especially when tempted by so many food stalls at the maxwell food market their chicken achieves that elusive perfect balance between cooked just enough to be tender but not too well done for the meat to be dry texture is spot on gingery sauce and spicy sauce is delicious i miss this place still\",\"my friends and i went to singapore recently and planned our days around eating of course tian tian hainanese chicken rice was on our list and luckily we went when there were only a few people in line we ordered  large plates of chicken and rice and  plate of beansprouts and cuttlefish to share the chicken was perfectly poached and tender and the chicken stock rice was fragrant and flavorful the dish was served with a citrus chili sauce which was unique and tasty we lucked out with not having to wait but i have heard a wait of mins mins is standard a must try if ever in singapore\",\"another michelin rated hawker meal another lineup and another great meal for only sg the chicken was smooth and rice was not oily and tastes good you cannot beat the value taste proposition for sure is this a wow out of this world meal not quite but still worth a try if you are in the area\",\"got there  min before it closes the line was not bad for saturd night they cranked out the orders very quickly this place def knows how to handle the long queue which its fame has brought we ordered  medium chicken rice  each  side of vege in oyster sauce  the chicken was solid relatvely tender not too dry skins bone attached most of the chicken were good cuts with minimal unwanted parts when served it already has a layer of light sauce on it but they also privode you with a side of spicy dipping sauce again i wish they have that cantonese style dipping sauce that has more minced ginger slightly saltier the rice was also good cooked in the chicken is own juice the vege was pretty good as well lightly flavored still relatively crunchyoverall the place serves solid food but i could barely distinguish it from the other good hainan chicken rice places\",\"i can understand why this place is so popular we showed up around  and there already was a line the chicken was very tender and moist though i am confused by why there was no skin included rice was also well flavored if a bit too soft for my taste no aircon in the hawker center so grab a coconut or soursop juice from one of the stalls across and you are good to go\",\"i love coming to singapore to visit family first stop tian tian hawker stall hawker stalls are the place to eat for some great food in singapore chicken and rice are pretty much a staple in singapore so its easy to find the food here is sooooo amazing and delicious simple cuisine big flavor and so filling good service then you grab a seat and chow down\",\"there was a line and they were prepared with lanes set up it moved pretty quickly though i think the other famous spot was closed so this one was extra busy i ordered the thigh and greens on the side the hardest was finding a spot to sit to eat the chicken was top notch flavorful and super juicy and soft the pepper was great i asked for  lol i went back before we left and they were closing and only had breast left they discounted to  each i took  even the breast was super moist i wish i could eat this every day\",\"i was building this up in my head so much that i was sure i was going to disappointed such a cheap michelin star restaurant there is gotta be a catch right not with tian tian we had to wait in line for about  mins compared to the bay area where it takes  mins to just find you a table this was a breeze the plates bowls on which they actually served the chicken soup while not perfectly clean was cleaner than the others we had at the hawker centers hey that is how it goes right now the actual food the rice was something you can eat just by itself it was flavorful and the aroma was out of this world and it paired wonderfully with the deliciously supple chicken the soup just tied it all together i was disappointed a little bit cause my chicken had bones i was surprised a little bit by that and it did take away something from my experience but overall for that price and quality a must go but do not wait in line too long though the other chicken rice places in the same hawker center and not bad at all\",\"okay do bear in mind i have been to singapore  or so times in the last  years still have not made to this place until recently i had one day that i was in singapore before the work week started and i had made a determination to check off the lists on my guidebook botanical garden orchid garden garden by the bay is skywalk chinatown was next so i arrived and it was hot so i was very lost and was happy to be lost lined up to get a milk tea and someone recommended me to this spot all i really wanted was hainanese chicken rice in singapore truth be told it is changed in the last decade or maybe i have changed the first time i had it was in  i thought it was disgusting i did not have any acquired taste for asian food then i barely saw any asians in my life now i must admit i have got a more refined taste for everything asian tian tian has a line on a sunday afternoon at   pm all tourists i gathered anthony bourdain was here the lady in front of me was from london asian british lady on her honeymoon we chatted about this spot and we each ordered a small plate holy cow  usd basically we ate happily with chili on the side we made friends while standing in line the location is called maxwell center or something with maxwell in it you need to walk away from chinatown passing by some super cool buildings that house chinese restaurants into a hawker market space area excellent atmosphere exceptional chicken dish i would definitely take friends and families there not that i have anyone who would visit me in singapore not that i go to singapore that often but this chicken is growing on me and this stall\",\"maaaaaaaaaaaaan this place is humid hahaha and this place is ginormousgantic bring some shorts and a tank top and some good sneakers cuz you are gonna walk miles here hahasimply because you get so caught up in looking at this then that then this a great way to see singapores plant life in a non commercialized environment\",\"loved it but do not go here in the summer months tends to get very humid and that will absolutely ruin the visit we went during the hottest season in april or it seemed like that the humidity was peak so after a little while of walking it became exhausting which ruined the experience a bit all in all despite that i still had a great time the place is huge probably impossible to see in one go lots of different trails to walk around to get a good view of the different vegetations take your time wander around and get lost in the this beautiful place just make sure to have water and some snacks\",\"a unesco world heritage site this place is gigantic with shops and all manner of plants hidden inside\",\"there is a lot of various flora and fauna to see here not to mention a lot of things have information printed in front of them so that you know what you are looking at and it is importance it was extremely hot the day i visited i ended up walking from one end of the gardens to the other so make sure to stay hydrated bring a fan hat sunbrella and sunscreen also take a map and do not be afraid to ask for directions i originally wanted to visit their orchids exhibit too but at the time it was midday and i did not want to bake in the hot singapore sun though since it was march holiday singapore residents and prs got free admission which is a pretty awesome way to promote the exhibit besides there were a good amount of orchids on display in front of the national orchid sign in front of the exhibit so i do not think i missed out on too much there is also a path before the bonsai trees garden that has a bunch of the miss joaquim flowers growing\",\"singapore botanic gardens is indeed massive aka huge to explore from one end to the other end i went with ht on a wet friday morning first time when i went to singapore botanic gardens in a downpour its free to enter the park do allow yourself plenty of time if you intend to cover the whole singapore botanic gardens since ht wants to visit the national orchids gardens in which at the time we visited some parts of the exhibits are under construction the highlight of my recent trip to singapore botanic gardens in a downpour was to see a family of otters swimming around in the pond nearby the singapore botanic gardens is accessible by car bus or the nearest mrt station is botanic gardens mrt station cc dt both the circle orange line and downtown blue line do visit their website run by the national parks where free guided tour is available during the month and the schedule allocated for these guided tour it can be found through this website nparks gov sg sbg educat\",\"lovely peaceful green open spaces calming meditative lingering knowing that it can be hot just plain and simple the singapore botanic gardens is really a lovely place to wander meander walk explore get lost learn it is like the mini ny central park of singapore although much cleaner greener and more beautiful difficult to see all the themed gardens properly in one visit unless to are good on your feet to wander around for  hours or so but a great place in singapore to visit even if you only have an hour there are some places in the garden that i was in the presence of dozens of people and then there were other areas that i was peacefully all alone void of another single soul short the giant lizard that crossed my path there is no charge to visit although specific areas like the orchid garden will have a nominal fee the botanic gardens are reachable via the mrt there are many places to purchase cold drinks snacks and souvenirs the visitor center is large with gifts and souvenirs in abundance especially with an orchid theme grab a map when you enter the park be sure to have some water to hydrate with you wear good shoes for walking and enjoy this gem of singapore\",\"pretty garden where you can take a jog or enjoy a sunday morning or afternoon with the family on sunday is it gets pretty busy since lots of people take out their dogs or go jogging\",\"gorgeous spot tinier than i expected many types of gorgeous flowers and shrubbery a sight to see\",\"founded in the year of  singapore botanic gardens was inscribed as singapore is first unesco world heritage site on th of july  i am one of the very few here who is giving one of the most popular attractions in singapore a less than a  stars review like fellow yelper matias h i am more of a city person and not a nature person this does feel more like a park a huge park to be exact rather than a garden i do not even remember when was the last time i visited the singapore botanic garden this week i have a friend who was here for a conference and extended the stay for a few days we decided to check out the gardens together it was awesome now the mass rapid transit mrt has built a botanical garden station next to the attraction use the downtown line or circle line to come here admission is free for all except to the orchid garden saying singapore botanic gardens is huge is really an understatement it is massive the grounds are very well maintained we were blessed with good read hot and muggy weather i take that kind of weather any day rather than heavy downpour or thunderstorm when visiting a place like singapore botanic gardens where there are not many shelters admission to orchid garden is sgd it is inexpensive there are many beautiful orchids there there is also a section of vip orchids which are orchids named after foreign dignitaries i saw there is an orchid there which was named after queen elizabeth ii during her visit to the gardens in  there are not enough benches throughout the attraction again i do feel this is really more like a park i guess the weather being too hot and muggy or heavy downpour thunderstorm can ruin the full enjoyment of the botanic gardens this will be a perfect place to relax have a nice stroll do not be ambitious and try to cover all grounds or just want to escape from the hustle bustle of a city provided the weather permits then again for me i chose gardens by the bay over here any time as my peaceful sanctuary in the the bustling city called singapore\",\"such a beautiful and romantic garden and best of all is that admission is free there are exhibits inside for which you have to pay but there is plenty to see and do for free this garden is beyond large you can spend all day admiring the different flora and fauna you will see beautiful water features sprinkled throughout including water falls and serene lakes a warning it is muggy so you will probably sweat your clothes off\",\"favorite place in singapore twenty minutes from cbd and you are in a tropical paradise wildlife orchids trees open lawns great restaurants trails fresh air love coming here to walk around have a picnic read a book\",\"a very well maintained garden with a variety of plants and flowers to look at while taking a nice slow stroll the tall trees make cool shades away from the blazing sun good to go with kids and elderly\",\"every community needs nature and with this enormous garden especially considering the size of the country singapore nailed it obviously i am not the first one to say so unesco for one beat me to it by a few years as a tourist who is not used to the kind of heat and humidity singapore residents call normal the size of the garden was a bit much to bear all in one day yet all in all i am very glad i paid a visit if you are in doubt between this and gardens by the bay this is totally worth it imho\",\"this park is huge and absolutely stunning spend several hours here just walking or bring a picnic i have not done the orchid house yet but look forward to it\",\"the singapore botanical gardens is worth a visit when in singapore the gardens have numerous trails and sections the entrance is free except if visiting the unesco world heritage site orchid gardens the admission to the orchid gardens is only s  if you only have time to do one thing visit the orchid gardens at a brisk pace it is possible to walk through and see everything in an hour there are numerous photo opportunities in the orchid gardens i have never seen so many different types of orchids in one place the variance in color is phenomenal peaceful and tranquil even with all the other visitors\",\"beautiful gardens with excellent cafes and restaurants despite the heat this is a must do in singapore\",\"clean and green the singapore botanic gardens is a beautiful park free to locals and guests from around the world if you wish to see the world class orchids in the orchid garden the entrance fee is a small s  there are many amazing sculptures to look out for during your walk i love the one with the marble ball floating on water you can spin the heavy marble ball it is all about the physics the gardens has an outdoor amphitheater where you can take in free concerts put on by the singapore symphony orchestra there is a diversity of plants and wildlife i love watching the various waterbirds that take advantage of the ponds in the gardens there are exotic birds like the hornbills i also love the adorable squirrels with the handsome black stripes the best time to take in the gardens are the mornings and evenings when it is not too hot and the crepuscular wildlife are out\",\"wow what can i say this place is absolutely amazing and is arguably my favorite part of singapore the diversity of greenery here is amazing as you can experience different biomes such as the rainforest and high altitude mountain plants all within the same park there are a lot of different exhibits that make you think you are in a different part of the world or even time period this is a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of the city and nothing is nicer than coming here for a brisk walk or light jog to start the day the best part is that aside from one part of the garden the entire thing is free this is an absolute must do in singapore i would recommend tackling the gardens in the early morning or late afternoon while it is still very beautiful in the afternoon singapore is humid weather will make it a very sticky experience\",\"quite frankly this is one of the more soothing but delightful botanical gardens that i have ever visited the whole park is wonderful you should definitely go\",\"everything about singapore botanic gardens is pristine and beautiful and a wonderful way to spend a day away from the urban intensity of the mega malls the gardens are expansive exceptionally well kept and wonderfully free and the special orchid garden exhibit is only  per person which seems quite reasonable once in the park you can meander around all over the place with only seeing a few other people so again it really is a nice break away from the crowds within the park there is a nice variety of designated areas a jungle y area medicinal plants exhibit etc there are also some surprises like monitor lizards which i thought were pretty awesome compared to southern california is tiny emaciated little lizards the restaurants on site are also worth visiting as we felt all of them seemed to have good seating you are not crammed inside a building but rather have your pick of outdoor seating with pleasant views and shade and an impressive amount of healthy food choices do wear sunscreen as there is a decent amount of shade but you will still see a good bit of sun also the gift shops including the orchid exhibit one have some beautiful pieces of art so keep that in mind for any sort of christmas mother is day whatever type presents\",\"this zoo was awesome definitely a different feel from what you experience in the usa they have a lot of free range animals which is amazing people are super respectful and they get close are considerate enough not to actually bother the animals the animals seem quite happy here which is always a plus when you go to these type of places you want to make sure that you are supporting the right type of place overall super clean and you definitely get to see a nice wide range of animals a couple of things i thought were highlights right at the entrance when you walk in and as you walk through the park monkeys are free range and just jump from tree to tree there is a beautiful butterfly enclosure where they have lots and lots of space and are definitely living their best life an extremely large walk through aviary with lots of cool birds to seei did it in under three hours but i am sure you could take a little extra time if you like this location is kind of in the middle of nowhere but not too far from the main part of singapore it takes roughly  minutes to get here from the city from my experience night safari and river safari are cool to do but not necessary if you have to choose one out of the three if i had to put them in order it would be singapore zoo night safari then river safari\",\"i came here to see the night safari since it was recommended to me i highly recommend getting a ticket on klook because the prices at the zoo are way higher i personally am not a fan of zoos and going to see animals so i honestly did not find this experience interesting since it is at nighttime it is hard to see many of the nocturnal animals this was also a family attraction and that means i had to be around a lot of crying babies and kids personally this attraction was not for me i did like rainforest lumina though they have a lot of colorful lights set up around the zoo that you can walk through great for some photography opportunities i do not see myself coming back here unfortunately but only because zoos are not really my thing it seems\",\"im not really a zoo person so for me to say this place is amazing is amazing in itself i cant say enough about the staff working at the zoo professional courteous and helpful the exhibits are world class our highlight was the pandas who does not love a cool panda right one of the best attractions in singapore\",\"monkey see monkey dothe least expensive way to get to singapore zoo is by taking the mrt ns red line north to ang mo kio and then walk thru the mall to the bus depot look for the door for  bus and get into queue if you forget how and where the mrt station attendant will have printed directions the scenic winding  air conditioned bus ride is approximately  minutes in duration from mrt orchard station to the singapore zoo entrance it will take approximately one hour recommend getting there early when it first opens at   a m animals are most active and awake while waiting for their meals once they are fed it is siesta time and no primate sign language will awake them we brought along umbrellas and water without them i am not sure we would had endured three hours walking in the extreme tropical heat you may bring your meals and liquids but that means you have to lug it around there are plenty of onsite restaurants to satisfy the pickiest of eaters during our visit the polar bear died and primate exhibits were both closed plan your walkthrough accordingly by coordinating show times of animal shows made the mistake ourselves and missed all the shows except for the begging elephants it is a family affair visiting a zoo expect lots of kids strollers and non english speaking visitors as expected no ticket price discounts for nonresidents weekends and holidays are always busier note  of my beautiful animal photos were censored without notice sorry\",\"this zoo is amazing because many of the herbivores and omnivores are allowed to wander throughout the zoo for example upon entrance we were greeted by monkeys and birds walking around the park people are fairly respectful of the animals which i thought made the experience better you can tell that the animals are well cared for and most of them are in quality habitats there are so many animals here and the park is big enough that you could easily spend an entire day or more it also rained at the park so thankfully we had umbrellas and rain gear there is not a lot of covered areas around the park although trees and plants offer some coverage the night zoo is across the way and it offers a completely different experience where you can ride an open one level air bus or choose to walk on dark paths with guides helping you cross walkways some of the carnivores are so lively and close by that you can truly experience the lack of protection being a human offers it is extremely dark on the paths and there is some hills so i would not recommend it for those who have trouble walking as you can stumble easily i had about an hour so i ran through most of it after the bus tour that navigates you through the areas and allows you to peek in and see the animals often herbivores may come right up to you or even cross the street\",\"what an amazing zoo gorgeous natural enclosures and free roaming animals starting from one of the bathroom areas near the entrance a covered pathway leading to the restrooms was contructed with bat friendly tiles so that they can sleep there we saw a few snoozing upside down one was a mama with a baby clinging to her signs said that the bats sleep there then fly at dusk the bathrooms themselves are lovely with foliage open air pond you feel like you are in the outdoors another spectacular exhibit was the elaborate orangutan area a huge enclosure that spans even more area with a multi pathway of vines resting feeding platforms high above the human path we saw an adult orangutan a baby acrobatically weave their way over from the group on these vines adorable the tram that you can choose to add on to the park entrance ticket  at ticketing or  at the tram is a nice way to get to a specific area but the pathways are paved easily walkable we even saw several groups with wheelchairs easily accessing the exhibits and many areas had foliage coverage from the sun which was helpful in the heat one of my all time fave animals is the flying fox big furry friit eating fox faced bats so cute i have never seen them in person adorable to see them sleeping upside down with fruit set out for them for when they wake up we were lucky to see the komodo dragon feeding time they hung a huge chunk of beef on a rope let the  y o adult out he went right over chomped on it ripping it off the rope seallowing it whole i would highly recommend going to the river safari too at ticketing you can get a deal on  parks which we did the river safari is where the giant pandas my personal fave the capybaras are so just going there for them was worth it to me loved this zoo i would totally come back again\",\"world is best zoo hands down no question the animals here seem happy and well cared for they get to roam either freely or large habitats even the pelicans have an enclosure that size of something you would see at seaworld for a much larger creature there are multiple feeding stations throughout where you have the chance to feed the giraffe rhino elephant galapagos turtles and others for  there are multiple feedings scheduled by the keepers as well to really get a close and personal look at these fine animals these feedings are scheduled throughout the day and are free there are also adventure tours where you can swim with otters feed manatees sit with the orangutan and have breakfast and many many more while more expensive obviously these are still amazing opportunities it should be noted that this is singapore be prepared for heat intense sun quick rising afternoon showers mosquitoes etc there is a nice tram that takes you throughout the park when you need to rest your feet but it is an additional cost to your ticket of  child to  adult i have an annual pass which includes all tram rides and some other benefits such as unlimited entry to all  parks unlimited tram boat rides and discounted food bev adventures and gift shop purchases it is a bit more than a   park hopper but this helps the park thrive and frankly i have come back again and again\",\"what a truly amazing place for anyone and everyone to come to we spent an entire day from am until pm here and needed more time to see and enjoy everything this place has to offer we started the day off by having breakfast with the orangutans what a cool experience we got to walk up to them and take pictures with them right behind us as they ate their breakfast you can see how fun these animals are and what personalities they all have there was a mom with her young baby we got to see up close it was very cool the entire park was full of amazing exhibits and animals make sure you hand feed some of them it costs spd but worth every penny we hand fed rhinoceroses and giraffes what an amazing experience this zoo is quite possibly the best zoo in the entire world and is a must do if you are in singapore no trip here is complete without it\",\"i came here to see ah meng the baby orangutan and granddaughter of the original ah meng the orangutans are great ambassadors to the singapore zoo which itself is world class and well maintained on all levels this is a fun touristy thing to do that should take up almost a whole day i would recommend doing breakfast with the orangutans because you get to see them up close and take pictures within arm is length of them and ah meng too to do the breakfast you have to reserve your spot through the website maximum  months in advance you will get an email confirmation you pay for general admission and then when you are inside you pay again to get into the ah meng restaurant it is a bit of a stretch but how often do you get a chance to see orangutans up close also the orangutans are free range so when you walk outside they will be up in the canopy there is a lot of cool things about this zoo the baboons flying foxes and sloth are cool the zoo itself is huge it is a big walking loop with some cuts in between so if you check the map and see that you missed out on something you can ride the trolley to the nearest stop and yes you have to pay for that and btw the buffet food is just okay there is your typical western breakfast on side and asian stuff nasi lemak congee bee hoon on the other not much to comment on within that regard the food court separate from the buffet itself does have a few interesting options though i got the malay soto and thought it was good oh and hopefully it does not rain on your visit\",\"i am one of those people who can see both sides of zoos and i do not really know which side to follow sure zoos are necessary for animal education to inspire humans to care more about animals and the wildlife but are caged animals really the best way to do this so i think i tend to avoid zoos but i read up about the singapore orangutan program and was really excited to see them since my grandmother was solely responsible for sparking the orangutan protection programs in brunei in the  s we booked the breakfast with the orangutan experience through viator this was a bit of a letdown we seemed to arrive right at the tail end of the experience and had to eat our food in  seconds to then queue up to get close to the orangutans for  seconds anyways at least this rushed experience allowed us some time to walk around the zoo we took the tram first to figure out where we wanted to see more of first impression this zoo has no cages ok not fully true but  true they mostly use a moat system so the animals who do not want to get wet do not run away without the feeling of being quite so caged it was quite refreshing the animals here covered the span of africa asia without feeling repetitive take your time and explore there is lots of little side paths that you might not notice that take you to even more\",\"one of the top zoo is in the world because of the interaction with the animals displays cleanliness and beautiful landscaping the animals are healthy and well cared for and several displays have animals that you can interact with with staff close by to protect the animals the aviary bird house has mousedeer and coutimundi is that will stay quite close to the walking path yet staff that will step in and correct people that try to pet them or get off the path for a selfie great policy of allowing the interaction but only so far use the mandan khatab shuttle and it is only  sd when you do not have a pass will definately return when in singapore\",\"this zoo is huge with a total area of  acres and how big do you think is that a baseball field is about  acres that means this zoo has a total area of  baseball fields again as in other theme parks in singapore be prepared for a lot of walking this zoo is a lot different from any other zoos the animals are enclosure free a moat is the only thing that separates the animals from the public the animals can walk freely in a lush of forest like greenery other animals are just roaming freely and interacting with the public there are about  animals in this zoo they are grouped according to their species the zoo is also well organized there are maps and signs available but it is not really needed because the zoo layout is easy to navigate surprisingly unlike any other zoos singapore does not stink at all it is very clean and no unwanted smell of animal poop or pee how they are able to do this is pretty amazing as big as it is the entire zoo has wifi connection impressive is not it would you believe there also showers available in the toilets wash basins can be found all over the zoo they even have filtered water machines for free in case you want to fill up your empty water bottles how about if you feel hungry while inside the zoo do not worry there is several of restaurants inside the zoo and by the entrance as well i thought a trip to the zoo will bore the hell out of me but to my surprise it turned out to be a memorable experience i therefore conclude that a visit to the zoo is a must when visiting singapore\",\"i have been to zoos all over the world and this is hands down the best i have ever visited the habitats are amazing and thoughtfully created with the best interest of the animal in mind there were tons of activities and moving around was easy with the tram system this is a must see in singapore\",\"tip buy the tram ride adults  children  they do check tickets at almost every station when you are getting on i can appreciate those who wish to walk but there is so much to see that requires tight timing like the shows feedings and zookeeper chitchats that riding the tram can really help you get what you want to see in my daughter and i went on a rainy day fortunately we have been there several times before so it was not so disappointing when the animals were understandably seeking shelter the most obvious was the rhino feeding at   pm the rhinos were so disgusted with the rain that they refused to come out from their shelter even for food and treats we were delighted that in the month of june there were many baby animals rhinos monkeys giraffes they were all very cute the free ranging animal concept is fantastic with the rain many were huddled under leaves rocks or shelters as we walked through the fragile forrest exhibit we were sad that the sloths were hiding the giant fruit bats obviously did not care about the downpour we had fun observing them eating heartily using their hooks appendages to move along the branches the lemur family hid under the platform and the mouse deer found shelter under large leaves on the forrest floor catch the splash safari show the sea lion is adorable tip the seats marked blue is the splash zone get ready to get wet we also enjoyed the rainforest fights back and the primate feeding even in the rain the singapore zoo is a fabulous place to visit tip we were glad we got the  park hopper tickets online it saved us money and included the tram rides  adult tip if you are taking the public bus if you do not have a tap transfer card make sure you have exact change many tourists do not realise that the bus drivers do not provide change and the tourists become outraged that the system is not customer oriented\",\"i have been to many zoos in my life throughout the u s and have been impressed at maybe just a few the singapore zoo blew it out of the park it was amazing we started our tour by having breakfast with the orangutans i would say skip this part and just eat breakfast beforehand the food was more enjoyable at the buffet at our hotel at the breakfast you can get your pictures taken with the orangutan with your own cameras if you do this try to get in line first if you decide to make the mistake and book the breakfast honestly it was not that impressive to me since it is not like you can touch the animals if you want to photoshop a pic with an orangutan you can save a lot of money for this attraction and avoid it all together the overall zoo was awesome because you can get quite close to the animals i enjoyed watching the elephant show the most probably because i am a huge elephant and have a tattoo to provide it haha anyway we did not arrive in good time before the show but would recommend getting to the show about   mins early so you can get a good seat and also have a chance to feed the elephants bananas how cool is that well i have feed bananas to elephants in thailand and i can say it is awesome there are plenty of toilets located throughout the park and a few refill water stations for your hydration needs you will need to drink plenty of water because well it is hot and sticky in singapore duh you have the option to take the tram or walk while inside the park honestly we walked everywhere and there were places throughout that have ac so you can duck in and cool off also be sure to bring plenty of spf and a hat or umbrella to help combat those sun rays that can age your skin\",\"all i can say is that when singapore does something it does something right and the zoo is certainly one of those places that they have done right well there is more than just one zoo here in singapore though but this is the main zoo it is huge though you can get around in about three hours and that is if you do not hang around for the numerous shows there are trams that take you around the place but it is small enough that you can easily walk all the paths like a lot of zoos the zoo is divided into sections which focuses either on a different animal type or a region there are even some animals positioned where you can get much closer than normal oh and for some reason there is a polar bear here as well which has made me scratch my head since i did not think they could handle a place like singapore\",\"do it it is an easy walk and a lot to see totally worth it do the pickup by bus and breakfast with the orangutans the buffet is okay and has something for everyone you get to stand in front of the orangutans and have a picture taken\",\"can you believe that i am an adult and have never been to the zoo well that changed when i got the chance to visit singapore i did a tour through viator which included transportation to and from my hotel annnnnnnnnnnd drumroll breakfast with orangutans ok maybe my excitement was a bit much but again this was my first time at a zoo this was only a  hour tour so it was impossible to squeeze in the entire park we started off with the breakfast and the orangutans came down and just hung out and ate with us not directly next to us though close to the end of breakfast we got to snag a picture with them and as you can see in mine she did not look to thrilled with me hahaha afterwards my friends and i tried to map out what other animals we could see but only had time to see a polar bear and the elephants we also took a tram around the park and saw that all the animals not in cages just roaming freely to an extent come on now they are still wild animals next time i am in the country i will be sure to spend more time here and be one with the animals\",\"i have always loved singapore zoo it helps because i love animals too it is one of the best zoos i been in my life it is always great to come back and seen all the animals it is nice to see that they are being treated well and are in good hands i have done all of them river safari as well as night safari my favorite would be the zoo and river safari for different reasons i had the chance to have breakfast with orang utan as well taking pictures twice with my husband with them as the background one when we first started dating and the recent one after  years of marriage over the years singapore zoo have grown and i grown up with them they have expanded through my hazy memories i believed at some point i have taken pictures or met ah meng as well as inuka though i have moved i have never forget to make my way back to singapore zoo each time i am in town it always a great feeling to know they are still the same clean lovely rainforest like environment with the aim to protect and educate us people about animals as well as its surrounding oh yeah the water in a carton box has totally shown how proactive they are in conserving our environment it was a first for me to drink water in a carton and i totally support their effort you go singapore zoo\",\"another awesome place animals can be seen within close proximity lots to see and do with  parks restaurants onsite recommend\",\"clean safe for stomach michelin star restaurant with the prices of the foodcourt all dtfs i visited in singapore were great\",\"this is my third din tai fung but i like this one you know immediately they do a good job on their special dumplings xiao long bao the restaurant is at orchard road most of the wait time is about  minutes i waited only  minutes as usual i order the crab xiao long bao it is soupy and crab egg in it very good the soup here is better than my previous two other locations i got the shrimp dumplings it is half moon shape the only thing i would said is good finally i have try one of their specialty the black truffle xiao long bao it is rare item each piece cost  sg the make of this dumplings is with black truffle it doe carry plenty soup it it it has great taste the food come out quick service to the table is attentive i would said is a way to move the customer to create space for the people who waited\",\"when you are used to   hour waits in los angeles to eat here and pay much higher prices it is like heaven eating here in singapore where you can just walk in sit down and eat i can report that f here at the wisma atria shopping center felt to me as if i were in foodie heaven so many choices and in the middle of this chaos of food teasing is din tai fung we sat down and were promptly served two orders of xiao long bao and felt pacified as the soup explosion in my mouth placed me in a state foodie hypnosis and that was just the regular order we then order the one with truffle flavoring and i felt like buddha must felt when he found himself in reclining position as he attained nirvana seriously i really enjoyed the quality here and feel as if i have cheated the entire state of california whole will wait another  hours before they can sit down and have about  of the quality of xlb that are here we also had the drunken chicken simple and excellent then for a refreshment i had the grass jelly drink perfect then we had a mushroom and minced pork with noodle dish simple and perfect all in all singapore when it comes to food is like placing money on bets you will never lose that is what happened here tonight this foodie is one happy man\",\"still awesome xiao long bao and fried wontons i had the crab xiao long bao and seafood pork fried wontons very good taste\",\"i love din tai fung i live for their soup dumplings i have officially been to their los angeles costa mesa hong kong and shanghai locations now cannot wait to conquer more locations dtf has a good selection of dishes soup dumplings are excellent cucumber with chilli sauce dish is very refreshing pork wontons is a new dish i tried while in hong kong and now i am going to get it every time\",\"i am a big fan of dtf and have been to many locations in the usa and taiwan even went to the original so when we had this opportunity we jumped at it after we arrived we were seated right away we ordered items we usually order and the first item the cucumber appetizer it was served cut lengthwise and had an odd sauce and odd taste the food in general was just ok and the service was slow and inattentive left the restaurant disappointed which never happens if this had been my first experience i would most likely never go back\",\"how can everything here be so delicious i think i had dim sum approximately four times during my one week trip to singapore and this was definitely the best of all of them we did not have to wait too long to get seated and we were able to decide on what to order while we waited so our food was ready very quickly once we sat down i honestly do not remember everything we had i just ate and felt happy there were a couple highlights though xiaolongbao delicious i have often had xlb where the soup has leaked out by the time you eat it all not the case here full of soup perfectly complemented by the ginger and vinegar truffle xiaolongbao if you like super strong truffle flavor you could probably eat many of these i could only eat one but it felt like the most decadent xlb i have ever had chili crab bun what is not to love chili crab combined with the fluffiest bun heavenly fried rice i could have eaten the whole plate enough said chocolate red bean dumpling i have never tried a dessert dumpling before and i was a little skeptical of chocolate and red bean combined in a dumpling but it was delicious the flavors match really well and the chocolate is so nice and melty be sure to save room for this din tai fung really is the best and it lives up to the hype\",\"this din tai fung is located on the th floor next to japan food town was there on a saturday for late lunch the staff at the entrance gave me a number and a paper pen so i could check what i liked to order while waiting the wait was not bad at all good thing i did not have to stand in line think i ever mentioned in my other post i do not like to stand in line period staffs were all friendly and attentive i like that the restaurant has those bag holders stands like those in taste paradise which allow female customers to store their purses or bags of cos those at taste paradise were a lot better since they came with a flap attached to secure the top the ones at din tai feng were open bag holders which the staff would just put a cloth over it ok i know i can be so nitpicking food  the legendary xiao long bao steamed dumplings were yummy as expected i also ordered one red bean bun and one meat bun just to try they were tiny but were good ambience  it was noisy but i did not expect it to be calm and quiet it was not a place i would suggest for a first date more like a place for friends to catch up or family lunch staffs  staffs were attentive helpful and polite water was filled up constantly\",\"first things first do not be alarmed when your party is food does not arrive at the same time the plates are delivered as they come out of the kitchen you will see this throughout singapore another thing pay your bill on the way out of the restaurant waitstaff do not have access to cash registers now onto the good stuff do not judge this restaurant for being nestled in a mall this is not food court food it is a fun dining experience with delicious options for most diets vegan options are not available order up and share with your table for the best experience what we shared dumplings vegetable pork chicken vegetarian shrimp pork shao maithe dumplings were delicious and being able to share with the rest of my group made for a really enjoyable dining experience i rounded out my meal with the egg fried rice pretty standard and the red bean xiaolongbao for dessert try this try this try this\",\"try the dragon boat dumplings and tea especially the savory version very nice this time i also bought their own chilli oil and chilli sauce to use at home hubby likes it a lot\",\"we are from the us and it seemed odd going to a food court to eat but this place was great fast service and a nice view onto the street the steamed buns were good and the spicey cucumber\",\"our favorite dumpling restaurant always fresh always delicious if you can find a location for din tai fung near you i highly recommend visiting it is also very family friendly for young kids\",\"food is so evarage very few options and low quality of food the crab soup dumplings is stink which is very unacceptable nothing special\",\"was in singapore last week and went to the dtf on orchard road it was so good that i went back a second time on monday evening there was no wait for a table on friday we waited  minutes i have been at three of these places in  different countries taiwan usa and singapore and all were terrific\",\"just okdefinitely overpriced for the quality and quantity want tap water be ready to fork out  cents not the money just ridiculous to charge for tap water food was nothing special wished we had eaten at the hawker stands in front of this restaurant instead of here would have been cheaper and probably better\",\"could not decide what to eat and stumbled on dtf i have had such high expectations for their soup dumplings that when they came out i was a little disappointed not to say they were not good or anything because they were but just overly hyped the dumplings are small and succulent the drunken chicken was moist and full of alcohol i do not think it is a  star restaurant but it is good\",\"andrew and i always wondered how din tai fung dtf can consistently keep their rich flavour after opening many branches around the world we visited a few din tai fung restaurants when we were in singapore and were blown away at their good quality control at the same time we also thought that we were just lucky two things that we always ordered in din tai fung were their shrimp pork shao mai and of course the  folds original xiao long bao dtf is xiao long bao is really in the league of their own honestly we never found any broken dumpling skin although i never really counted the number of folds on their dumpling the shao mai was also always very delicious with plenty of pork meats inside i always add vinegar to shao mai and the xiao long bao as i love the additional sour flavour on the meat of course the price of their dishes are more than the other chinese restaurants but the quality never disappoints us\",\"i had my first xlb experience in august when i waited over  minutes to eat at din tai fung in seattle it was well worth the wait and when i found out that there are locations all over singapore i had to make a visit this location is located on the top floor of the wisma atria which was super easy to get to from the grand hyatt where we were staying i was delighted when we did not have to wait at all and were seated immediately they even set a carrier next to our table for all of our packages from shopping i liked that a lot i ordered the braised beef noodles and pork xlb which was what i had ordered in seattle everything was delicious i love that the xlb is consistent and still amazing no matter where you go to in the world i did notice that the braised beef in my noodles was a lot more fatty that the meat pieces in seattle perhaps it is the geographical preference another thing i noticed was my friend and i were practically the only asian people in the restaurants making me think there are probably many xlb restaurants that give dtf a run for their money but no matter love the xlb here and had a great lunch\",\"a great place for dim sum for a gathering with a few family and friends   looks really nice from outside until you get closer to the kitchen seems a bit dis organized but they do get your orders asap nothing unique about their dishes that stood out but i had not tried everything a bit pricey for dimsum in singapore\",\"first of all the wait was not too long and then the service is just incredible here never a minute where my water was not being refilled now to talk about the food absolutely best soup dumplings i have ever had in my life and soooo much food for a very reasonable price came hungry left full and happy my favorite menu items were xiao li bing and the oriental vinegar salad only thing i would steal clear from here is the pickled mustard with meat otherwise superb food service and atmosphere planning to come back again before we leave singapore\",\"loved the cloud forest dome it is huge and amazing i have never seen so much tropical plants and orchids before in one place i really enjoyed myself here and you can tell from my pictures i do have to note this place was super cold inside the dome with the big waterfall inside made it worse it was full on ac and i thought tropical plants needed warmth this is not for folks with a fear of heights too the pathways on top were pretty high up there great for picture taking this was well worth our advance purchase and to avoid the long lines at the ticket counter it was a little cheaper as well totally recommend while touring singapore\",\"this is a absolute favorite if you made the trek to the gardens by the bay put up some cash for a trip to this enchanted forest and garden up in the clouds the tiered levels as you ascend makes it feel and smell like you are in the clouds if can get a bit misty and foggy in parts as you make your way up there is every mix and color of orchids you could think up so many unusual blends of gorgeous and wild flowers everywhere it is a result of the beauty nature can yield if left to their own devices\",\"it was slightly cheaper to buy the cloud forest with the flower dome experience together than to buy them separately so that is what i did if greenhouses are ur thing then this is the mother lode of all greenhouses that must be witnessed live it was super cool to see this alive and robust tropical paradise in all its colorful glory i did not want to see another plant after this experience which should tell u that this forest will satisfy all of ur tree hugging needs for many years to come\",\"the cloud forest is one of the attractions at the gardens and is inside one of the large domes i do not know exactly why it is called the cloud forest the dome may be as high as the clouds outside or there may actually be some clouds inside from the waterfall and rain they have created there it may be cheating that i post pictures from inside the dome since you have to pay to go inside but if you do not get a chance to go to singapore and see this you should have a chance to see what you are missing after all the photos i am posting i think you will want to make the trip\",\"we stayed at the marina bay sands so it was a no brainer to stop by the cloud forest because it was within walking distance and came with good recommendations from local friends upon arrival we were met with a cool breeze and spray from an indoor waterfall a cool that you wo not find often in singapore that alone was the worth the price of admission we were so impressed by the variety of tropical plants the orchids and the setting of each area the skill of the conservation is amazing and is extraordinary there are around seven levels to explore with different themes or focus i felt like i was in an unreal bubble looking out towards the real world which also seemed unreal because the whole city of singapore is an architectural marvel i would really recommend visiting the cloud forest and also leaving extra time for the flower dome because we regretted missing it\",\"first time coming here and i was completely blown away came in early on a week day to beat the crowd it was amazing being in here absolutely beautiful it is nice and chill thanks to the ac so it works as a great escape from the heat walking around you will notice dragon statues hidden throughout the place take the elevator up to the skywalk for better views including a cool view of the marina bay sands as you walk through the different levels they have displays and presentations about global warming and climate change i highly recommend coming here i left this place blown away at it is beauty and wanting to plant some trees\",\"if you come to singapore this is a must see usually botanical gardens would not top my list but this took my breath away honestly it is like walking through a scene from the movie avatar perfectly maintained you will state in amazement and wonder to yourself how they can possible keep up with the sheer variety and amount of plants sprinkle in some amazing art work that ties in perfectly to its surroundings you might as well be walking through a fairy tale also some of the best views of the skyline really just gorgeous\",\"by far one of the most beautiful places i have ever seen i could not recommend it more to visitors it is a little pricey but completely worth it they also have a cloud pathway in which you take an elevator to the very top and then walk down a pathway that circles around the mountain of plants and flowers it is absolutely stunning i would recommend not going after  pm it gets extremely busy and the line to go in was very long initially we bought our tickets online but there was a mixup and had to repurchase them there so i would recommend just buying it there\",\"out of all the features of gardens by the bay the cloud forest has to be my absolute favorite destinations the cloud forest is an immersive and lush experience that is sure to take your breath away right when you walk in you are greeted by a massive hill of green that houses more plants exhibits and a sky walkway highlights of this whole exhibit for me would have to include the orchid garden and the sky walkway the orchid garden is small but carefully curated all hybrids chosen to be displayed are beautiful and have different aromas do not be afraid to stop and smell all of them additionally the sky walkway is a seemingly expansive trail above the cloud forest that gives you various views around the whole building there is various stops on the sky walkway that will give you informational exhibits about plants landforms and so much more overall a magical way to spend your day\",\"buying a ticket to cloud forest feels like buying a ticket to the year  right from your first step into the wonderfully air conditioned greenhouse you are instantly greeted by a larger than life waterfall ripped straight out of a scene from avatar plant people architecture afficionados and those on the quest to become stay insta famous will all find a slice of heaven in this modern marvel the variety of plant species and flowers on display are almost overwhelmingly plentiful the walkways and supporting structures throughout this mega greenhouse are truly well designed and rival those of science fiction finally there are several platforms to take in views and living walls that make for picturesque backdrops all enough to make any instagram addict foam at the mouth singapore is cloud garden is a wonderful place to feel inspired and truly awe struck enjoy your stroll through the greenhouse of the future\",\"it is magic you have to go if you are in sg if you have only enough time to do either the flower dome or the cloud forest do the cloud forest i cannot describe in words how amazing this place is you walk around the bottom floor and then go up around this central rainforest mountain probably the best part about sg\",\"the cloud forest is a must see when visiting singapore the gardens are exceptionally well kept and breath taking it was not super crowded but it was busy when we were inside leave yourself plenty of time to admire everything from the driftwood sculptures to the microscopic orchids cloud forest is sure to please any nature lover\",\"wow this is hands down the best greenhouse i have ever been to in my life you walk into a cooled building and are greeted with a pretty waterfall surrounded by lush greenery and vivid flowers this is enough to make the ticket price worth it as it is a nice reprieve from the heat outside you go through the many levels of plants and see rare flowers that you probably would never see in your lifetime there are also cool native artworks from southeast asia interspersed throughout the foliage the best part for me was the surprising ending where they give you information about climate change i think the way they did it was very well thought out and not preachy which i believe helps people want to stop and listen if you are in gardens by the bay this is a must stop sight\",\"this was a good experience loved the indoor waterfall especially that it is always on the top things to do in singapore although other than the waterfall and experiencing walking down the different flights from bridges there was not much to the place there were great views of the outside through the large glass windows there is a two for one ticket for the cloud forest and the flower garden dome\",\"the better of the two i came for the rainfall it did not disappoint the best view is at the entrance and looking up at the rain fall the rest of the cloud forest is exploring plants that grow in a forest condition quite impressed with the design and creativity that thought to have a water fall in a greenhouse the other best feeling is the air conditioning a great way to spend  hours away from the hot weather\",\"cloud forest is an amazing and unique experience i am usually bored by botanical gardens and conservatories but this one was special it really feels like jurassic park loved the waterfall the elevated walkways really the entire experience if you visit one place in singapore make it cloud forest\",\"imagine a large indoor rainforest with a towering waterfall tons of flowers and greenery and a cave with stalagmites stalactites reminds me of my school days i think they had an episode on the magic school bus show about this as well so much to see it was just beautiful and at times quite tranquil to walk around this forest it was a visual and sensory experience the best thing about it was the air conditioning provided in this indoor greenhouse forest this was much appreciated what when the consistent temperature in singapore was usually more than  degrees f this is a must do on your list if you come to singapore the ticket for cloud forest also includes access to their other exhibit the flower dome so that was cool they also have mist shows here at different times of the day so cloud forest looks even more mysterious and magical i am really glad we got to check this out\",\"what a work of architectural nature artistic elegance this is worth the  sgd or so entrance fee and i opted to pay for entrance to the flower dome as well so best in a bundle this dome is beautiful and is perfect for a cool off break from the hot humid singapore weather you feel it first as you walk in and observe the fresh huge indoor waterfall it is cooling plus there is air conditioning so if you need i would recommend bringing a light jacket or shawl the temperature is at least under  degrees celsius i would say as you hike up and around the center hill waterfall you are able to see the various types of plants and species that you would find high up in the canopy of the world is tallest trees it was really unique and the layout kept you in awe the whole time there is also a portion which highlights the stalactites and stalagmites which can be found in some caves as well this is a definite highlight for travelers near and far really unique and i cannot say if there is anything in the world like this\",\"if you can visit one dome in the gardens by the bay make it this one while the flower dome is awesome this one is more spectacular with the vertical waterfall and high arch skywalks upon walking in you can immediately feel the cool relief from the blistering humidity you will follow the path that eventually winds up to the top of the dome where you will be rewarded with a grand view walking back down along the windy skywalks is breathtaking it is pretty much a surreal experience and not to be missed\",\"so pretty and an amazing experience better than the flower dome i have heard from multiple people  dome is   domes is  it is cheaper if you are a local resident the dome is majestic with beautiful greenery contained within at the end there is also great info on how they power gardens by the bay with sustainable energy and a video on climate change encouraging you to be more environmentally friendly i went around sunset which is best you get to see it in the day as you enter and as you slowly descend the dome the sun sets and at the end it was nightfall and i got to see the dome at night too great experience for tourists and if you are local and have never been check it out\",\"thanks yelp for directing me to this restaurant as my very first meal in singapore ever i was not convinced that this place warranted the reviews when i saw a couple patsy white ribs in some clear ish broth how could anything be delicious when it looked boiled with no seasonings nope nope nope i stand corrected i can admit i was very wrong the meat was unlike any other ribs i have ever had and the broth is just an extra bonus how something so unassuming and simple can be so good i can not pretend to even know but my socks were completely knocked off can soup make a grown woman cry yes yes it can the ambiance and service is simple the price is low and the product is amazing will i fly back to singapore for ribs in soup i just might\",\"best bak kut teh pork rib soup in singapore too many good food in singapore and it is hard to say which one is the best however if you ask for bak kut teh recommendation i gotta say songfamedan is the best among all i am so impressed by the tenderness of the pork ribs which they even show you the level of tenderness of each pork rib soup on their menu no wonder they are listed under the michelin bib gourmand pro tip do not worry about you will finish the soup quickly as they have unlimited refills\",\"best food i have had in singapore the service was fast and food came out almost immediately but the bak kut teh is to die for this is a traditional singaporean dish that consists of braised pork ribs with tea broth the broth is rich with a rich garlic flavor the meat practically falls off the bone a large portion is around  singaporean dollars   us dollars plenty of seating but it can get cramped since there is so many customers however i miss their food a ton and would for sure come back if i ever am in singapore again\",\"get a portable and foldable silicone cup to protect the health siliconeuse com product\",\"currently back in the states and i am regretting not bringing back song fa is bak kut teh spice packets fair warning the soup is verrrry peppery i personally enjoy the kick but i can see how it can be too much for some other than that the broth is sooo warming i enjoyed it in  degree heat so i cannot imagine how good it is when it is cold does it even get cold in singapore the pork rib is tender and meaty i loved biting it off the bone best part is that the soup is unlimited once they see that you are running low a server comes to refill your bowl do not be discouraged if you see a line outside as it moves super quickly\",\"i get the hype it is one of the most consistent places in terms of both food quality and service even though the food is fairly simple i find myself coming here pretty much once a week on the weekends to get my fix the broth is definitely the highlight for me it is peppery but there is no sharp heat it is so comforting that i usually get at least   refills the meat is pretty tender but the broth is really the star i personally get the large size because i do not get rice or noodle but i think most people will be fine withe regular size the other items are pretty decent as well but i always stick to the bak kut teh as the primary focus the only down side is the line queue they do make the wait time more productive by taking order first\",\"this soup was not bad just not my favorite it is a peppery porky broth but the soup and pork ribs were little bland by my standards it is nice that they refill the broth though i did not really get the hype around this but maybe i am just not used to singaporean cuisine get the lemon iced tea really refreshing\",\"i would come here and just get the pork soup we got the normal one large  pieces vs  pieces for rib you get unlimited broth so we just got one large bowl with about  refills omg so good so peppery keep in mind i have not been to other ones but i loved how homey and cheap it was the other items we got were pork trotters chicken feet lightly fried chicken rolls none of those really stuck out tbh i would stick to just the soup they were not bad by any means just nothing could match the soup some soup a little bit of rice and i think you are set we also got the soursop drink and i really thought the fruit worked well\",\"damn this place is the place to come for dinner we had veggies beancurd skin pork belly premium loin ribs soup and rice the premium loin ribs soup was very very tasty the soup was very well made and with lots of punch the flavor was on the spot i addition the ribs were very tasty up to the bone the punch of the night was the pork belly it had the proper combination of fat and skinny meat the sauce made the dish even more tastier i gotta warn that this place gets pretty crowded and the wait line can take up to hr or more so be prepared for such long line and long wait time\",\"so so simple but so so good and love that it opens at  am so my friends and i could get a breakfast in ordered the pork rib soup which is what they are known for especially if it is in the name of the restaurant and they constantly refill the soup which is nice it tastes heavily of white pepper but i love it and the pork is so tender it falls off the bone definitely one of those restoring and revitalizing feeling soups also got the braised pork belly which was good but if you are sticking to a smaller breakfast just go for the bak kut teh would definitely come back for another\",\"go a little late to avoid long lines during meal hours they have the best bak kut teh pork rib soup ever their broth is amazing and they come and refill your bowl if you are low they also have other good vegetable and meat dishes but their pork rib soup is the best they charge for green tea and refill it only once for free super delicious clean and air conditioning\",\"oh my oh my do not judge a book by its cover their pork rib soup may look simple but i like to think it has magical powers the peppery and warm broth hits your throat like no other it really warms up your body and makes you feel so good the soup is sweet and peppery but never too overpowering not to mention the pork ribs are so damn tender so easy to bite off and does not have a weird meaty taste just so damn perfect i think this dish is pretty healthy i had a sore throat the day i tried this dish and it completely healed itself the next day what a magical soup this is\",\"one of the best bkt restaurants around song fa is famous and old though i do not think they would be the original as there are variations of who made the first bkts hokkien style or the more herbal version i would definitely recommend getting the pickled mustard greens to pair with the savory ness of bkt also they come around and refill the broth which is the best part\",\"very cozy feeling when you walk into the store definitely recommend trying their items on the menu with the stars i got the traditional pork bak kuh teh and i absolutely loved it i am usually not the type to order soup when i go out to eat because i am scared it wo not be flavorable however song fa definitely is a michelin star worthy restaurant it was so delicious that we bought their packed soup base to bring back home to make\",\"the soup here was delicious and the staff is friendly and helpful as well i ordered the ba ku teh which at about  comes with  pork bones and soup but as you are eating the bones and the soup they come around and refill your bowl with more soup the big benefit of that is that the soup always tastes super hot because there is only so much soup at any given time and every time you get more the soup pipping hot which keeps the experience super enjoyable the broth has a rich tasty pork taste with a bit of pepper in it it was a hearty warm loving soup and i personally liked the amount of pepper i thought it balanced the soup really well the cai lan was also pretty good as well as the lemon tea overall a super enjoyable experience and one of my favorite meals in singapore\",\"went to singapore to visit a friend and this place was recommended to me this place has a couple locations around sg but i was advised to go to this one i ordered the one and only bak kut teh for breakfast the pork ribs were soft and fall off the bone the broth soup is pepper but light they also refill your broth soup for free it is really good with rice definitely will go back here when i visit singapore again\",\"work lunch singapore style pork rib broth endless broth  pieces of super tender pork ribs peppery white peppery broth needless to say i want more i had three bowls side dishes are bit salty it also came with a bowl of rice it is stereotypical singaporean small dishes and lots of soup i am not complaining but the broth soup thing must be lost on westerners who did not grow up with soup the soup is almost white in color and they refill it from a kettle made for tea thus the name translates into meat bone tea however this thick broth is exactly the kind of thing asians grew up on especially southern cantonese chinese i would love to come back but knowing my immediate family which i put them under the white people category this is not something they would be up for so save this meal trip with fellow soup aficionados\",\"i have only had malaysian version of pork rib soup prior i had no idea singaporean version was so peppery unlimited refills on broth we ordered their pork ribs loins premium ribs liver kidney every cut was perfectly prepared and extremely tender dipped in a bit of house made chili beyond delish soy braised pig trotters pork belly and pig intestines my fav was the melt in my mouth super cooked down collagen from the trotters the braising sauce was so tasty spoonful over rice you got yourself a perfect meal limited seatings but they are very efficient in getting tables ready also they begin taking your order as you stand in line so foods are served as soon as you are seated def check out song fa when in sg\",\"if you like peppery as opposed to herbal bak kut teh this is one of the best places in town popular with asian tourists who come by bus loads to savour this delicacy in addition to the signature pork ribs they also have pork kidney large and small pork intestines chicken feet tofu skin pork belly the wait can be up to an hour in spite of them having two outlets almost next door to each other occasionally you see a hardcore caucasian customer more typically adventurous backpacker types rather than conservative bankers of lawyers but rarely south asian ones and almost never middle eastern ones\",\"tea based ribs soup is the specialty here and it is deliciously soaked in the savory broth you will get one refill of the tea throughout the meal the appetizer combo is a good deal if you want to try out the different snacks but those can be skipped if you just go for the ribs now what is not fun is if there is a wait there is no a c here as everything is open air pretty much like a hawker center best to dine and go quickly\",\"amazing breakfast spot we tried the ultimate combo perfect portion size and good price sat outside and watched city go by croissants were amazing and perfectly baked served hot with new zealand anchor butter service was really great with a smile food came fast perfect breakfast spot clean restrooms\",\"one of the best brunches i have had in a long time reminded me of the hipster brunch places in pdx which is always a good first sign they have delicious coffee a second good sign great vibe too and its a hole in the wall place below a nondescript hbd complex but easy enough to get too via mrt bus i got the smoked salmon with scrambled eggs and a baked tomato the salmon was fresh eggs were done perfectly wife got the baked eggs which were delicious cupcake sized baked eggs wrapped in bacon on brioche just mouth watering had the affogato to wrap up brunch and the espresso was just delicious warm earthy tones that paired well with the salted caramel ice cream must try place in sgp\",\"this was actually our first meal in singapore and it was absolutely delicious i got the iced orange mocha and the norwegian smoked salmon scrambled eggs the mocha had a great flavor and was not too sweet my actual meal came with a lot of fresh avocado slices and was just the perfect hearty and healthy breakfast that i needed the workers were so friendly and the place is extremely aesthetic my friend really wanted to come back to try their other foods but unfortunately there were just so many places to try definitely my favorite brunch place when we were there though\",\"one of the best brunch places we went to in singapore i ordered an iced coffee truffle scrambled eggs and avocado bruschetta which were all delicious i would only recommend the truffle scrambled eggs if you know you are a fan of truffle oil as the taste can be a little strong the coffee and appetizers were great on top of this servers went out of their way to be kind and even ran after us outside when we forgot a pair of glasses at our table\",\"the good a local business service is you get seated then you order food from the counter when it is ready they deliver it to you at your table very straightforward delicious healthy fare go for brunch i had the eggs with mushrooms and bacon and it was so yummy they also serve coffee tea and pastries they take credit cardsthe bad can get really really crowded during peak times not ideal for large groups small groups are fine but if you want to come here with a group larger than   people you are going to struggle to find a place for you allthe ugly nonewould i go back for certain this place is a really great charming casual dining experience that makes me feel like i am back in the states this place is in\",\"ok wow we were dropped off a block away and got nervous due to the other stores on the shopping strip but do not turn back keep going and make it to tolido is there is a huge menu of coffee drinks both safe choices as well as local inspired creations iced coffe ice blends and espresso drinks alike the food menu offers unique items with fresh ingredients like smoked salmon lox and sausages they have an all day menu and a entree menu with seafood and pastas we had the rsti with smoked salmon as well as baked eggs with capers and fresh dill so satisfying thanks tolido is\",\"having stayed in singapore numerous times we discovered this place through trip adviser and what a great find as we tire of hotel buffets so we revisited again to discover it is still as good as  months ago i am not into coffee but anna and rated it highly all coffees are double shot unless single preferred milk options a little light compared to australia ie almond milk the food serves are generous and really tasty as displayed in the photos plenty of truffle in the eggs and cherry tomatoes in the shakshouka we have not had lunch here so cannot comment on the dishes to the right of the menu highly recommend toledo is\",\"american in singapore had breakfast two out three mornings great american style breakfast and great friendly service highly recommend\",\"this place was a special find we stumbled upon it in search for a breakfast spot on our last day in singapore delicious food and the coffee is outstanding it has an american flare of a menu and similar to the quirky pdx portland food which is exceptional they it you wo not be disappointed\",\"this is my first time to singapore and tolido is was a great recommendation service was great atmosphere was pleasant and the food was amazing the portions were very nice and i will be back\",\"i visited here while on vacation and was very pleased the service and food were great i recommend it to everyone and would definitely eat here again\",\"this is going to be one of my new favourite brunch places we found the recommendation online and in spite of the difficulty in finding good parking spots this place is definitely worth thevisit it reminds me of the cafes that you would find in melbourne sydney locals and travellers seem to know of this place as it was packed on a saturday morning their version of baked eggs brought us back to our favourite haunts in sydney and their pandan pancake was delightful with its full pandas flavour and gula melaka on the side they serve their coffee with a standard double shot while the kinds of food is not revolutionary they do it very well one of the major plus points to this place is the lower price of food compared to other similar establishments most items are priced in the   dollar range i am going to keep this place in my rotating list of brunch places\",\"prawns for breakfast sure why not this is a cute place to have both singapore based food and the american breakfast both utterly crucial to where me and my boyfriend were going to eat he wanted american vs i wanted singapore food tolido is came to the rescue although the walk was a bit of a hike from where we were staying bugis shopping mall area it was worth the walk the service was spot on and the wait was not too terrible granted i still recommend making reservations if you want a spot inside it can get pretty busy otherwise\",\"tolido is espresso nook is a great little breakfast place tolido is is a cute little place in singapore that while not particularly convenient is definitely worth walking over to neither the coffee nor the sweet breakfast is the best i have ever had but both were definitely pretty solid and service was appropriately quick it is hard to complain in that regard i got in had a good breakfast and got out in less than  minutes\",\"pretty good spot is extremely busy on the weekend but easy to sit right down on a week day wide variety of coffee type drinks including blended and smoothie options food was fine general western style breakfast type stuff\",\"double shot coffee at a much lower price than starbucks and with a wonderful latte art i say kudos to the owner as passion for good coffee shows service was also efficient and food wonderful only thing is you got to be patient for the wait as good things come to those who waits\",\"i have only tried their blended matcha latte and i must say it was the best matcha drink i have ever tasted will definitely come back to try more of their food and drinks\",\"tolido is is a nice escape from the heat and an intimate setting with incredible food if i spent more time in singapore i would definitely become a regular to start the pandan waffles are just amazing an incredible blend of pandan topped with coconut ice cream but of course i could not just stop there i decided to go all out and also ordered the truffle eggs a combination i would not have thought of on my own but it could not have been more perfect i still dream about the food here amazingly delicious\",\"great menu and service though go early on weekends if you do not want to queue coffee was fabulous as was the hot chocolate\",\"one of our finds for sunday brunches good coffee and all day breakfast the sea salt caramel latte was heavenly cafe had a nice relaxed vibe\",\"my boyfriend and i came here for dinner while in singapore and we were so happy we did we ordered chilli crab mantou buns and cereal prawns we loved everything and had a delicious meal we got the dungeness crab which i highly recommend because it had a ton of sweet crab meat it went really well with the chilli sauce you must also get the mantou buns to sop up some of the sauce they are deep fried slightly sweet bread rolls that are absolutely delicious i highly recommend getting both of these if you come here we had chilli crab at a hawker center and enjoyed it but preferred it with the dungeness crab we got here to the mud crab at the hawker center the cereal prawns were also delicious they come butterflied in a crispy cereal coating that has seasonings like chili and curry leaves in it they are fairly mild in flavor but were delicious i highly recommend also getting these service was not overly friendly but was fairly quick the place is definitely more expensive than a hawker center will be but not outrageously expensive i would recommend coming here if you are looking for good chilli crab in a higher end place\",\"i was recommended this restaurant by someone who grew up in singapore so i had to trust their recommendation i highly recommend purchasing the klook voucher before you come here as the food is quite expensive here i ordered a chilli crab and while it was absolutely delicious it would cost me about  sgd if i had not purchased the klook voucher i came here for lunch and since i was here on my own it took about  minutes to get a seat without a reservation they asked if i minded sharing a table with another party and i said no because i knew i would get seated sooner i was seated next to a girl about my age and her mother so it was all pleasant i ordered the smallest size chilli crab and used my hands to break into the crab along with the tools they provided to crack the shell i noticed some other people were provided with gloves and i think it is not fair that they did not even mention that they had gloves available maybe this would be something i would be aware of if i ate more messy seafood or if i were a singapore local big note they will offer you peanuts and tea as if they do not cost extra but they do so if you are trying to save some money refuse the peanuts and tea just get some water though that still costs extra regardless of choosing bottled or tap water another note they do not have napkins or anything at the table so if you need wet napkins definitely call someone over to provide you with some you will definitely need wet wipes because chilli crab gets messy anyway the chilli crab was very delicious i basically devoured the chilli sauce and the crab was yummy too the diy breaking into the crab was fun but super messy i would probably be happy with having any seafood with the chilli sauce but without the mess since i am just one person i was not able to try any of the other delicious items they have i hope i will be back here with some friends and try the cereal prawns\",\"sgd singapore dollar for some crab and fish seems like we were gettin played by our singaporean brothas and sistuhs but no we just had no idea what the hell we were ordering just look at the sgd gram and order the amount of grams u want to pay or that will satisfy ur belly do not order an entire fish crab if u do not want to spend close to  sgd i must admit the soon hock fish was phenomenal cooked to perfection in that wow i cannot believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce they do not make fish like this in the states the crab was delicious but ma pa makes me better crab so gotta knock off a star there was ample supply of crab meat the meat itself was sturdy full of flavor but we did not really enjoy the famous singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes if u do not want to smell like u have just rolled in some fine fish and crab u can wash ur hands at the sink inside the restaurant when u are all fished and crabbed out this is a seafood chain in singapore and unless u have dreamt of visiting singapore just to get a taste of the seafood here then just walk on by my friend cuz u can have the same quality tasting seafood for a better price point at one of the many food hawkers around town happy hawking\",\"holy cow totally wish we stuck with the street food and hawker stands waited all day to come try jumbo seafood for dinner and was so disappointed the whole dining experience was meh there was only one person taking orders you cannot just ask anyone to take your order or grab the server you would just get brushed off there were   of us dining  adults and a child we ordered the chili crab chinese broccoli small order of fried rice small order of noodles and  bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating nothing really wow ed us we were really underwhelmed especially for the price we paid honestly every hawker stand we tried the food was so good being that this was the most expensive meal of our trip we were slightly bitter and disappointed\",\"jumbo seafood is the place to go for crabs my parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in singapore with all the food choices that is a big endorsement unfortunately they were out of the alaskan crab the night that i went but we opted for dungeness crabs and they were still delicious everybody raves about the chili crab but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better but honestly you cannot go wrong with either choice the chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers the salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab the fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here sure it is a little pricey but it is well worth it you cannot come to singapore without stopping by a jumbo seafood location to grab some crabs\",\"during my  days stay in singapore in march of  i cannot not try the singapore award winning chilly crab here i was sooo excited to come and i have to say by far it is the best crab i have ever had in my life the sauce of the crab was soupy and you can dip with bread or donut i just ate it by itself and i finished the whole crab plus all the sauce did not waste any tiny bit well i did say it was the best crab of my life during the past  months i have tried a couple of malaysian and chinese restaurants in the northeast and have not found anything that was close to this i should have bought the chilly crab seasoning that the restaurant also sells my bf did not want to try any of my crab because he heard from many people who got sick with food in asia and he was extremely careful i did not care because i was born and raised in asia for  years before i came to the states he ordered a seafood clay pot instead which looked boring haha well that is his choice and nothing outside of the expectation but it is due to this disk that i am taking off a star he got very very sick after this disk i am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food but he started going to the bathroom twice before i even finished my meal omg poor guy we stayed at the marina bay and he almost did not make it back to the hotel that was his experience in asia did not get sick in a third world country vietnam eating all the street food but yet got sick in a restaurant in singapore and it was not cheap the bill came around  singapore dollars i know it was because of my chilly crab his disk was not that expensive i still love my chilly crab and want to come back to singapore for this but next time my bf for sure will just watch me eat\",\"a singapore institution that never disappoints situated on the shores of the river this beautiful setting in a warm singapore evening watching the people cruise by we started with a squid appetizer followed by pepper crab and chili crab crab comes with amazing sauce that cannot be described perfect little dough balls for mopping up the extra sauce love this place\",\"i am aware that jumbo seafood is a total tourist trap and that prices are high that said i was taken to a non touristy chilli crab spot by someone who lived in singapore previously and did not enjoy the crab at all since this was his first trip to singapore i figured why not go with jumbo i made a reservation for prime dinner time about  days in advance you do not need to book that far ahead but you do need to book early since it was only the two of us we did not want to order too many items we ended up getting chilli crab omg so good so messy so much fun we ate in silence as we concentrated on getting all the crab meat out i may have flung some crab onto the glass window next to where we were sitting oops fried buns perfect for soaking up the chilli sauce cereal prawns skip do not believe the hype it was not worth it we were in an out within an hour and were very satisfied with our seafood feast\",\"underwhelmed by the flavors and quality of the foods here we arrived here on a friday evening close to pm we only had to wait about  minutes for a table of  the restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside they provided waters and chairs for those waiting the restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to clarke quay center we were seated at a large table with other groups of  it took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders one of the customers had to flag the waiter down we were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional if we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts we ordered the chili crab and pepper crab along with fried rice and  buns i do not know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order  crab for just us  the foods came out very slowly and it did not make sense the ones who ordered last got their foods first it took about  more minutes until our foods came out the chili crab sauce was not good it had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell might have been overcooked the fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though the pepper crab came out way too late by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full we ate it anyways the flavors were odd i did not enjoy the flavors too much at the end of the dinner i felt nauseous and had to go back to hotel something about the flavors made me nauseous total came out around  usd expensive napkins were non existent we asked for some but were ignored\",\"someone at the hotelwhere i am staying recommended this restaurant after a walk in chinatown we decided to come here we got seated right away and we ordered the alaska king crab   kg half of the full crab about  sgd and we got the seafood noodles the sauce for the chili alaska king crab tasted like ketchup and was a little bit spicy not what i was expecting service was also very disappointing workers were rushing us to pay the bill even before we started to eat felt like we were been hustled peanuts that we did not ask for and was put in our table  sgd in the bill bread rolls that i did not even touch also put in the bill at least ask the guest if they want it instead of putting it on the table and charging for it i would not recommend this place way better other places in singapore to have chili crabs\",\"came for the chili crab and was not disappointed this stuff is so good and a cant miss in singapore i had found jumbo seafood on a list of best chili crab and had that recommendation seconded by a local so i could not say no one chili crab is about the right size for two people and do no miss the bao buns on the side to soak up all that delicious chili crab sauce also prepared go get messy digging in we had just a side of broccoli with the crab and honestly were so stuffed we did not need any other sides the wait was long but they take your name and number and clarke quay is a great place to walk around so just expect it to take a little time for your turn\",\"i really do not get the hype a single chili crab was  sgd which is about  for that kind of money i could go to an ayce buffet in vegas and get unlimited crab legs the flavor is pretty mediocre too we ordered pea sprouts but they were the baby kind not the tastier more mature kind and some sort of scallops in taro which i could have done without actually i could have done without the whole meal there are two branches of the same restaurant within walking distance of each other make sure you go to the right one reservations recommended this place gets busy\",\"a must visit for visitors to singapore jumbo seafood is the place to come for the classic singaporean dish of chili crab it is messy wear a bib it is spicy it is sweet it actually reminds me of the classic chinese tomato and egg dish perhaps not surprising since the sauce contains both these ingredients the cracked pieces of crab are delicious and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried crispy mantou on the side but chili crab is not the only thing to get here the vegetables stir fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness the seafood fried rice was a simple classic and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well but perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal when i saw this on the menu i thought that the cereal was just the breading for the shrimp but when the dish came i saw that the dish had way more cereal than shrimp luckily the crispy sweet cereal was an absolutely delicious part of the meal even eaten on its own\",\"salted egg coated food that is what this place is all about my colleagues and i came here for dinner none of us live here as it is super expensive to dine without expense account the crab was ginormous we ordered the set menu which is always the best  of us  a person totally worth it salted egg shrink and fish skin fried very singaporean and very cool salted egg coated crab and pepper crab two way delicious great view if you were to sit outside as it is right by the bay grab home as in using your grab app uber is no longer allowed since april in singapore or malaysia good riddance if you ask me and you should find a car sharing service nearby i do love me some singapore\",\"went here during a business trip had to stop by twice to try two different type of crabs black pepper and chilly sauce crabs we like the chilly one better\",\"chili crab is excellent their fried rice is one of the most well made fried rice i have ever had each grain is perfectly sauted and not overly saucily or oily\",\"everything about this place was great aside from the price chilli crab is expensive i get it but the quantity we got just was not the best for the price we paid other than that though now that that is out of the way the food was freaking delicious and the reservation system online was really easy and convenient to use the decor inside is very pleasant and comfortable and the servers were very helpful and polite which made the atmosphere and experience good for us also the salted egg golden prawns were an excellent appetizer along with the mantou bread to drench in our chilli crab sauce would still recommend coming to this place if you have never had chilli crab or are dying to get chilli crab but i wo not be back for a while after being underwhelmed by the quality value ratio of singapore is national dish\",\"alaays good expensive but always good the chili crab i have spent so much on those crabs\",\"really good seafood restaurant the price is fair for every bite of eaten you can feel yes the seafood worth the price\",\"kg for s  for non swim crab it is somewhat pricey and no service at all they told the customers pm last call for ordering and the restaurant close at pm a few tables came in around  pm they did not come to us to play the order when they finally do the dishes took sometimes to come then as you dig your hands into working on the crab the waitress came asking for payment on the total all of us must clean our hands and get the money or card to pay first before continuing eating this is for a pricy restaurant in the area and no customer service while they was not short hand at all then they force you to drop everything to make payment unbelievable and unacceptable\",\"i wanted to wait until i visited nyc before speaking on tmbh and i am glad i did i can say after having top rated bagels in nyc that this bagel house is legit and for my sake the best i have ever had i have had some fabulous bagels but what really sets this place apart are their creations nothing is spared when creating a fresh well made be is smoked brisket or pickled beets capers or properly crispy hash brown sandwich with perfectly complimentary fillings and add ons staff and super friendly and knows your name within one visit seating is more adequate than others in the area as there are plenty that do not have any at all i know there are a lot of amazing choices in tp area but if you want an amazing breakfast with healthy or not options and a variety to satisfy any palate you will be glad you stopped here on your way\",\"my recommendation is pearl harbour spam cheese scrambled eggs and some greens this is one completed delicious plate in one buns wish i had when it is still warm\",\"when my friend swore two men bagel house was close to the real thing in ny i refused to believe it if no where else in america could get it right how could a small place inside of a mall in singapore do it i am not sure but this happens to be one of my only repeat experiences in the city because the bagels are just that good is it true to form nyc not entirely they are a bit on the small side but boy do they have a bite to them the old myth of new york bagel success was something along the lines of it is the elements in the water but was later debunked to be the boiling process of said water and barley to make it truly stand out could two men be employing a similar method they claim to be the first bagel house in all of singapore and started only a handful of years ago each bagels are supposedly handmade and they recommend that folks who do not want to face the daily disappointment of their potential selling out should call ahead of time to confirm availability the bagels themselves are soft and have just the right amount of density the variety is not impressive to most new yorkers montreal folks but they do have some interesting ones like cheddar salt garlic and all sorts everything bagel the salmon they are using is not the kind of lox i would find back home but this is a respectable alternative for being on the other side of the world for first timers keep an open mind this is one of the only games in town and the closest thing to anything from the us try one of their bagel sandwiches i vote for the lamb or bo ssam and beware of the morning lines\",\"am on a sunday when the store opens and there is a q what the thought i was being smart be there early think again ok bagel really good these guys have done it well the combo bagelwiches pretty good execution of orders efficient and the coffee even comes out at the same time as the bagel all in all wonderful meal though like the bagel a hole in the pocket\",\"unbelievable how the food and the staff are equally as great the lady at the wrap was all smiles and will to recommend and navigate the menu i got the hot link bagel add avocado and it was really great looks like the lunch options would be just as amazing if not better thanks tmbh\",\"my fav is the avo baco bagel it fills me up all the way til early dinner it is a little hard to find but once you find it try it you will keep coming back for more great bagels in cbd\",\"best meal in singapore it was delicious bagels fresh daily we got the last two bagels when we arrived at  pm we had the avocado bacon sandwich amazing and also had the walnut cream cheese on another bagel so good just go\",\"visited singapore prior to a cruise during holidays dec  we located this place by tripadvisor and yelp so gave it a try ordered the bacon avacado bagel and pb jelly for kids and food was excellent also had their coffee and mango smoothies all good as others have commented service was excellent but beware place was absolutely packed busy we came around  am and there was a que and was standing room only limited seating obviously its busy for a reason also the music was so loud felt like i was in a club with base pounding and could not hear ourselves talking reason why i fave  stars instead of  just be aware it will be busy with loud music as others have commented on great place to do takeout also it was not cheap  usd for breakfast\",\"this is probably the best breakfast place i have ever been to the wait on a saturday morning is  worth it i would recommend getting there as soon as they open if you do want to avoid the wait the staff and the quality of their food is a   for sure\",\"went here cos of the hype but i felt the bagels were about average the fillings were pretty good though had the avocado with bacon and it was really fresh music was really loud and distracting so not a place to sit and chill i would go back but only for takeout\",\"an amazing place a great combination of service and product they can stand their ground with any nyc or nj bagel shop it was that good a lox bagel for less than  usd easy to find and short walk from the mrt station very friendly staff love it i will be back\",\"what is a bagel it is a hole with bread rolled around it ha ha just had to get that out there just gobbled down the last bite of my a b l t from two men bagel house and boy am i happy sg may look back in the future and possibly say the eastern european food scene started right here at tmbh albeit by a singaporean love the vibe from this place and of course the bagels walked up to the order counter and just about everyone in the kitchen greeted me with a big hello and a smile do not come here if you are looking for a bona fide proper new york bagel because the owner borne tells me that his bagels are made with the singaporean taste buds in mind he is tried bagels from both coasts of the u s probably in between too and has decided to make the bagels lighter and smaller he make batches throughout the day to ensure freshness and quality business had a rough start a couple of years ago but things are really rolling now swing by and get treated like a vip customer which is becoming a rarity these days and treat yourself to a round of deliciousness you wo not regret it\",\"two men bagel house makes me upset why have i been living in singapore for  months without having their food why do not i live in the tanjong pagar area why do not i work in the cbd why is not the service as good everywhere else so many regrets just to tell you that this place is da bomb i heard many raves so i was super hesitant mainly due to previous experiences with hyped western places in singapore but two men delivers i took one bite of their cowking bagel which is pastrami based and i was sold it was everything i expected and more in addition the staff is amazing they are super friendly knowledgeable and cheery once i am done crying in my corner over the fact that it is quite far for me i am going back highly recommended\",\"let is face it bagels for  in singapore is like chicken rice for  in london you have to make sacrifices if you are not eating local specialties once i got over that it was great every choice so far has been done perfectly the bagel toasted yet soft the ingredients top quality the smoked beef one is particularly good although being able to go and buy a decent smoked salmon bagel in singapore still remains one of my favourite discoveries in the relative food desert of tanjong pagar the filling is generous enough that these days we split one between two but we are not big eaters service is fast and friendly\",\"i have finally tried this place and although it is not a ny bagel this is the closest damn thing i loved it i should say i ordered breakfast from this place avocado egg cheese bacon and the only downside was that i did not get two the bagel sandwich was glorious as if i would just gotten it from a bodega down the street i did not quite understand the weird white sauce was it mayo was it cream but honestly who the hell cares it was delicious and i would happily stuff one in my pie hole again\",\"best bagels this hemisphere living in australia where there is a severe lack of quality bagels these were delicious they offer classic schmeres plus bagelwiches with a bit of singaporean flare will be going back again on our stop over not sure where the negativity is coming from\",\"yuck traveled across the city for this and i can promise you these are not ny style bagels they are dry not chewy and this is the first time i have ever had an everything bagel with zero flavor the eggs were so wet and the cheese was so greasy it was just a sloppy mess on top of a dry tasteless roll people in singapore must never have tasted real bagels because these sure are not them yuck\",\"they have bagels of course but also all day breakfast bagelwiches as well as pizza bagel i picked a seeded bagel and chose cowking pastrami parsley onion sour cream jalapeos montreal bacon gherkins not for me melted cheese and sunny side egg   bagel is nice and chewy add a home made iced tea for  not great will come again\",\"this gets  stars from me i have been living in asia for about  years and bagels are really tough to come by this place reminded me of the bagels i had growing up they are definitely top quality the layout of the restaurant is very chill and carefully planned the menus are written across the wall in chalk in a font that screams hipster style you can take your time and read the menu and i have seen quite a few people myself included taking pictures so you can remember what they have for next time when you order at the register you give them your name and they will holler for you when your order is ready i recommend doing their two men is crafted bagelwiches do not just get a plain bagel with cream cheese they have gotten so creative with their menu and i have to say there is not one thing on the menu that does not sound mouthwateringly delicious to me i am working my way through their menu and so far everything i have had is top notch my favorites so far are the cow king and the bird and what i really love about this place is that you can choose whatever type of bagel you want for the bagelwiches i really hope they do well and open more locations\",\"this small hole in the wall place is to die for packed when we went in the staff is bustling with energy my wife and i got different bagels and both agreed they were by far the best bagel sandwiches we have ever had our only regret is that we did not have room for seconds will be back\",\"a comfortable no frills coffee shop right in the everton park hdb it is a bit hard to find among the buildings but it is worth looking for nylon coffee roasters is better defined by saying what they do not have no chairs no sofa no frapuccinos no syrup no whipped cream no fancy oversized mugs no merchandise no bossa n whatever music no paper cups with your name misspelled on them they are very clear on what they offer excellent quality coffee the menu is quite simple three different brews either hot or iced they will let you choose which coffee you want and they have amazing central or south american beans to choose from at the centre there is a big table for people to stand around while enjoying a quick cup the staff are very efficient and friendly one of them took time to ask me how my coffee was it was fantastic perfect taste i challenge anyone to tell me if they have seen that happen on a franchise coffee shop and this is the main virtue of this place they are obsessed with quality they use scales thermometers and timers in order to brew the perfect cup of coffee every time even the stuff they sell is useful stuff filters cups brewing tools instead of merchandise they are on a mission to raise the bar on singapore is coffee culture and judging by the crowd of customers they are succeeding there are two basic philosophies when it comes to coffee bars there are those that focus on their atmosphere furniture and general feel sacrificing the coffee on the other hand there are those that focus on the quality of the coffee they serve nylon coffee roasters are clearly of the second kind and that is always welcome\",\"this place came highly recommended by a friend she was not kidding when she said it was hard to find it is kind of hidden in an apartment complex it has an american hipster coffee shop feel there are maybe only   chairs inside but there is some outdoor seating and also a tall long table with standing room inside inside is definitely preferred for the air conditioning the menu is simple and focused on coffee the flat white was solid pricing was not bad for coffee but beans are a bit more expensive service was friendly cash only if you are nearby it is worth stopping in for coffee\",\"this shop is closed for renovations yet the owner did not update in the system on the system it reflected open waste a trip there together i also saw other guess make a trip there the owner just walk out like nothing has happened what an idiot no sense of responsibility\",\"great little coffee shop that is in the middle of a twisted maze of a building complex not a lot of seating but very kind baristas and some really great coffee the standing table in the middle is definitely a great spot if you are on the taller side having air con is also a big plus\",\"a hard to find coffee place tucked away in the heart of a hdb complex this place takes its coffee seriously the staff is great and will give you recommendations as to what blend and preparation to select i got the beans from guatamala with a dash of milk wonderful aroma from the coffee and the place in general cash or nets only and not a lot of seating but the coffee is top notch\",\"coffee is good but you have to take it exactly as given asking for sugar is like requesting illegal substances to be added they argue the coffee is designed perfectly and needs nothing else even a request to take away is met with a frown as the cup affects the flavor\",\"one of the best coffee we have had and wonderful pricing only downside is seating else it be a  star for sure\",\"this is my favorite coffee shop in singapore i try to visit whenever i am in town and bring their beans home with me\",\"just brilliant expertly prepared single origin coffees and warm hospitality in a highly unexpected refreshingly ungentrified location\",\"my great auntie has lived at everton park for decades and once upon a time i even lived here too and i remember the days before when there was nothing remotely hipster about this housing block it is really cool to see cute new cafes and coffee shops moving in and i have been to nylon every time i am back in town that said there is no doubt that the coffee at nylon is great and i hail from a place where awesome coffee is the norm there is still something about nylon that strikes me as utterly pretentious it caught me by surprise to be told albeit politely that their coffee is sweet enough on its own that no sugar is needed or provided and i should try it and see for myself it was odd being schooled on how coffee should be taken and if even the most hipsterish mission coffee shop in san francisco tried this the ridiculousness of it would be blogged about endlessly so yeah mixed feelings about this place good coffee just do not bother asking for sugar\",\"this coffee shop is so hipster it hurts but i loved it i have been to nylon quite a number of times and the coffee i dare say is one if not the best in singapore the bunch of us know the owner of the shop he is also an alumni of the papa palheta coffee movement here in singapore and he will always there to share with us any specialty beans they have and would recommend some or else it is just a casual chat coming to nylon is like going to a friend is place where if you are a regular you sort of know the crowd here this coffee roasters serves only coffee but if you fancy a bite you can always walk over next door merely  steps for some cakes or shepherd pie they are pretty good too if there is one thing i would nick pick about this place is the lack of chairs there are less than  chairs in the shop and plenty of standing space there is a long communal table where everyone would just stand around it while enjoying their cuppa joe i guess they want everyone to feel young and hip like how we would enjoy our beer in a bar standing and chatting located on the ground floor of a hdb flat at everton park you have to navigate yourself around but it is easy to find we paid  for a oz latte and two iced coffee i would come back again and again and again and again\",\"excellent coffee a bit difficult to find this place but it is totally worth it and it is not expensive\",\"my first reaction when checked in here omg so many reviews deserve it truly deserves this much reviews i will describe coffee here as honest sincere decent strong smart i love honest people who runs a cafe eatery with all their heart and bringing things they love to share with others the owners definitely knows their stuff coffee it is my first visit and i was overwhelmed by how great coffee in singapore could taste with just beans and milk during my first visit i was told that their standing space is temporarily shut due to shortage of manpower it is running on a small space now but everything is still running in an orderly manner where the staff remembers customers faces and labeled their customers according to their face despite the space constrain and crowd orders were not mixed up and still served in an orderly manner anyway just buy and go la huh there is no space for you to sit and chill to enjoy your coffee i think it is more like a take away stall for now the menu is very simple hot or iced black or white coffee the price tag is the best a real good decent iced coffee cost  this is so much better than what you can get elsewhere i see notices that the owners source coffee beans direct from columbia see what i mean by sharing their passion and love to others\",\"so much has already been said about nylon and there is no doubt that they have been and are key to singapore is rise as one of the great coffee cities in the world with that in mind i have been inclined to give them five stars but i still end up at four the main reason is that while the coffee is roasted with great skill and the filter coffees are made very well i still see some room for improvement the main things that have annoyed me a bit is that often the coffees are out so perhaps only one of three coffees on the menu can be ordered and there has happened more than once that there are no beans at all for purchase the execution of the filters is often good but i do also believe that they could fine tube it a bit ti make it world class as i often have their coffee made better at other places and at home the place is however great for coffee and the location in everton park does feel more real and like a local experience at least to a visitor like me the space is considerably larger now then when they opened so there are actually seats outside for around  people and the high table inside can easily hold around  people the atmosphere is always nice and friendly and it seems like a lot of people living in the area go here as well do however not come in search of food as there is nothing really still this is one of the best places for a cup of coffee in singapore and it should be visited by anyone remotely interested in good coffee\",\"do not ever come here i mean it stay away i would like to keep this place to myself yes i will end up killing the thing that i love most but i do not care i have reviewed this place on tripadvisor and i am beginning to think i should stop saying good things about this place on the internet but i cannot help myself this is a no nonsense coffee joint run by people who really care about coffee and know their product absolutely unpretentious and sincerely dedicated to putting the best cup of coffee they know how in front of you dennis and jiamin maintain control over the entire process from sourcing to roasting to brewing all just to be able to say with absolute honesty and sincerity that they have given you the very best cup of coffee likely in all of singapore if you love coffee or think you love coffee dennis jiamin will take good care of you at nylon coffee roasters\",\"i love filter coffee and would grab any opportunities that i come across to try any cafe serving filtered coffee nylon coffee roaster is a cozy little corner for customers to chill out for a break there is little seating here literally less than  chairs however standing tables are provided if you are looking for a quick coffee break after lunch with   friends this is a nice recommendation not recommended for big group gathering\",\"the everton park hdb estate houses a number of nice small joints and nylon coffee roasters is located on the quieter side off cantonment road the small place was packed once we found it with a line building outside and i was surprised to see that there really is no seating but standing only at a community high table with no space left and the very small counter where you order and pay with the coffee grinders and machine at the back and if you are thinking of downing a muffin with your coffee wrong place this is coffee only it was a very hot day and we ordered iced coffee white and a ristretto with milk the lady serving us had a very organised tone about her and i was not sure if i liked the military style in which she asked what we wanted but i guess she wanted to keep the line moving and i forgot about it when she spoke to my hubby about how he wanted his coffee exactly as he is very particular they settled on a kind of ristretto plus a shot yes my husband cannot deal with weak coffee with milk so basically so strong that it nearly kills you and then back it up a little she did just that and he was amazed at how smooth the coffee still tasted as strong coffee is often just bitter and nasty my iced white coffee tasted great also very smooth and whatever beans they used i liked the full bodied flavour that did not let the milk overpower them speaking about the beans i really would have purchased coffee to take home but they do not recommend grinding at the shop you are supposed to do that at home not feasible for us as i did not pack all of my kitchen equipment from germany and do not see the need to purchase another grinder here so no coffee for me i thought long and hard on how to rate them and settled on three stars for the excellent product but the in my point of view lacking practicality in the dealing with customer requirements i might be back for their coffee though\",\"the treasure hunt is part of the joy of finding this spot buried under an apartment block keep your eyes peeled because it would be easy to miss this tiny nook of a store there is barely room for a coffee machine and a few people so it is hardly the place to hang around for a long time but if you do the staff wo not make you feel bad about it grab a chair if you are lucky and a magazine and drink as many coffees as you can before your heart gives up or prop yourself outside and watch the coming and goings of the neighbours these guys totally know what they are doing and the coffee is some of the best i have had in singapore\",\"excellent coffee a bit difficult to find this place but it is totally worth it and it is not expensive we paid  sgd for a cup of cortado and a double shot of espresso the service is also exceptional very friendly staff\",\"a true third wave micro roaster nylon coffee roasters located in everton park is a hidden gem on the ground floor of a large residential business complex located just a short walk from the outram park mrt station the small shop designed in the reclaimed exposed metal style that is typical of this style of business offers straight up coffee with no flavored offerings such as mocha is a small area is dedicated to coffee preparation items such as drip containers filters and cups bulk bean purchases can also be made and a fair assortment at reasonable prices is available\",\"take all my money after a  hour flight to singapore i was eagerly awaiting my lunch at burnt ends i basically opted out of all the flight food skipped breakfast and ended up ordering the chef is menu at lunch for burnt ends the outcome i have never been so full in my life since my husband and i decided to let our chefs dictate our menu i am not actually sure how many dishes we consumed that were a part of the regular menu items that were stellar standouts any of the beef cuts cooked to perfection the maitake mushroom with egg and rice the whole crab and of course the sanger by the time the sanger showed up we had consumed  dishes beforehand i wish i had another stomach so that i could have enjoyed the sanger even more getting dessert seemed impossible but we agreed to try the marshmallow and while it was only a bite it was also delicious as people have mentioned this place does require having a reservation and i know it is tough for folks in the us to secure one with the time difference we also wanted to sit at the counter which adds another complexity to procuring a reservation keep in mind that you will also be in close quarters with your neighbors if i am in singapore again i will definitely come back\",\"burnt ends is one of the toughest places to get a seat in singapore i had to book months in advance after failing to get a reservation on my other visits to singapore it has been consistently ranked in the top  asia restaurants list and went all the way up to number ten this year i was super excited to finally have a chance to get a table here overall i really enjoyed my meal here and had some great food mixed with pretty good food the pricing is on the high end and definitely expect to pay over sgd per person here food   starsservice   starsenvironment   starsoverall   starsrecommendations garlic shoots tenderloin with bone marrow sauce jet chicken wingsthe wait staff here was really attentive and my waiter helped me work through the menu st item smoked quail egg with caviar nice taste but really not worth the  sgd the caviar did not really add anything and i would not order this again nd item smoked jerk chicken wings were really tasty two small chicken wings but they were juicy and the lime crema was a nice touch rd item burnt ends sanger was a really well executed pulled pork sandwich the black sesame bun was nice soft and well toasted the cole slaw was well dressed and maintained its crunch and provided a nice texture contrast to the soft pork shoulder the pork was good for the most part but some parts were a bit on the dry side th item garlic shoots and gremolata is a must order the gremolata is delicious and the garlic sprouts were really nice first time i had this at a non chinese restaurant highly recommended th item tenderloin with bone marrow and smoked onion sauce is the signature dish of the restaurant and i can see why tenderloin is really one of my least favorite cuts of steak but man oh man is it really good here nice and red on the inside without being chewy that bone marrow and burnt onion sauce is awesome the side salad also provided some freshness to the dish and made it feel less heavy must order th item pumpkin pie with marshmallow ice cream the pumpkin pie has a nice crust and is not too overly sweet the ice cream however has chunks of marshmallows in it which i really did not like and gave the dish a weird chewy textured it also made the dessert steer towards the too sweet end would try the fog pavolova next time instead\",\"i get the hype with the experimental drinks and the different types of meat cuts but i just could not get into it the starters we had were caviar sea bass tacos meat toasted i would come back for the sea bass spread but not so much the meat there was to on the meat which is what brought me down a loot since  of our meat was fat the caviar was great and even with a teaspoon i would come back for that the drink were ok but of you are going out with friends who do not drink then they sadly might have a heard\",\"this is one of our favorite spots in the world service was excellent food is to die for the best ingredients perfectly cooked the blackmore ribeye was insane and also really loved the marron also enjoyed the salt pepper ribs and the quail egg w caviar cannot wait to eat here again next time in singapore\",\"excellent service and food difficult to get a table as there is limited seating with an open kitchen the wine is kinda expensive with aussie wines on the list the leek with hazelnuts is a treat different lamb cigar is a small bite size treat and the big deal was blackmore cube roll which was excellent well worth a visit\",\"it was a night that i will never forget this was one of those nights where you said treat yo self and boy was i ready to do that at burnt ends this restaurant is the hot ticket top rankings great reviews popular amongst locals and tourists so i was extremely excited to have the opportunity to dine at this restaurant since i wanted to treat myself i went and ordered the chefs select the best part of this was that i was able to eat at the chefs counter just to sit there and watch every chef showcase their skills and techniques it was a dream you get to see the creativity and the innovation behind every dish as it gets prepared you get to see the quality of the ingredients and the precision of this well oiled team of chefs i will be honest there were some moments where you questioned yourself for a bit because some dishes looked way too simple for example there was a dish where it looked like a grilled cracker with a crema and topped with a ton of chives but once you take a bite your mind is blown my favorite was their interpretation of steak and potatoes and the leeks with brown butter hazelnuts these were just the favorites but i truly loved every dish and wished i had more after every bite if you are looking for a michelin star restaurant with a cool vibe this one is it i highly recommend this place to any traveler that is coming through\",\"our favorite restaurant in the world it is just that good simple preparation of the best ingredients that money can buy cooked over wood by an incredibly talented team i wish this chef would open something a little closer to home but i am happy to travel to the other side of the world every couple of years for an incredibly memorable meal the blackmore ribeye here is definitely our favorite steak of all team\",\"i have nothing else to say other than this was an amazing experience make sure you get proper seating the experience can change your meal got the beef marmalade my god the bbq sauce was warm tangy and just perfect the beef itself was also amazing ofc we then got the pork shoulder sand which this had less emphasis on sauce and the meat quality really stood out we then got a burnt onion steak g and that was good as well i would not rave home about it but definitely good the next star was the ribeye g wow that quality of meat of amazing they just add a little salt to it and it was ridiculously good the pieces that did not have any salt flakes were disappointing in contrast to the well seasoned parts beef marmalade and ribeye were must gets here\",\"to the owner read pls readwow what an amazing dining experience i absolutely loved everything about this place except well let me get to that part first lets talk about what is most important at hand food how i got in i came here early on a saturday night because this place is booked online all the way until august i was told if you come early they accept walk ins opens at  but come at pm what i did not know was you would probably have to eat outside mind you eating outside in singapore is not so pleasant because it is so hot and humid but i wanted to take my chances the reviews i got from a couple i met said that this place is far better than most in california so my palate needed to see what the fuss was about anyways we got lucky and there was a cancellation and we got to sit inside service it was amazing the staff there are so nice helpful and just know what to recommend they were knowledgeable about the menu and most importantly they were attentive from empty water glasses to needing ice cubes they were on point i never had to wait to get anyone is attention spot on food loved the grissini and taramasalata lite airy with a soft creamy and crispy texture and the little chives gave it an added flavor leek hazelnut and brown butter yummy not a fan of leeks and the layers it breaks into but the thin buttery notes with a hazelnut makes a perfect pair beef marmalade and house pickle yasss sweet savory tender crispy crunchy with sour crunchy pickles oh my it is like a pull pork but way way way better a definite must try g  day dry aged blacksmores cube roll enough for two if you got all of the above best steak i have ever had hands down the beef was perfectly marbled and the meat so tender i ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly still melted in my mouth and the course salt was sprinkled on just right it also comes with a vinaigrette salad perfect to clean your palate in between bites so why why  stars honestly i was torn on whether or not to take a star then on my way home i thought maybe i should take  to get their attention but the food was too good to give them  out of  anyways it is so sad that such a wonderful restaurant can be ruined because the owner could not put down his phone during the whole  hours i was there he was texting and surfing social media in between preparing our meals i was a bit grossed out when i saw that because he touches food with his bare hands then goes to his phone and then continues to prepare food not once did he wash his hands do you know how dirty your phone is we place it everywhere take it to the restroom set it on tables and everything else how often does anyone sanitize their phones i do pretty often since i work in a hospital but it was soooo disappointing disgusting to see that the owner should be focused on how successful his place is and how happy everyone is enjoying the food he created not texting sadly enough i was not the only one who noticed another woman mentioned it after she finished her meal i hope he was receptive to that cause i would not want others to experience that would i come back yes but if i saw anyone on their phones while preparing my food i would not  for a unsanitized meal would not be worth it no matter how good it is\",\"i spent a recent saturday evening having dinner with a couple of friends who live in singapore and who have been raving about burnt ends for years burnt ends is an amazing restaurant serving grilled meats and seafood prepared over hot charcoal to diners seated along a long bar enjoying the show in addition burnt ends offers a wide range of cocktails and a prodigious wine list the sommelier is as passionate about wines as any sommelier that i have met you should take the time to have a chat with him if you are seeking a great bottle of wine i have included photos of the menu and the dishes that my friends and i had for dinner the beef marmalade is a highlight and a must do the miso eggplant is an unexpectedly delicious dish that should also be tried the steaks that i had were amazing although i am sure that anything offered on the menu will be delicious the most unique pairing of the evening was a jalapeo bourbon shot with a pickle juice back paired with the pulled pork sanger it was delicious i would be remiss if i did not mention the amazing service by everyone at burnt ends from the hostess to the wait staff to the sommelier burnt ends is the real deal and a complete package it should be on everyone is short list when dining out in singapore\",\"this was my first trip to singapore and i was consumed with trying the local food i had heard so much about the hawkers some of them even have michelin stars and of course i had to eat at a couple peranakan restaurants so it was not until our last night in singapore that we made it to burnt ends i can honestly say it was the best meal we had in singapore they are doing something special at burnt ends the roasted peeks in brown butter the smoked quail egg with caviar the steak tartare with caviar on a hash brown the white pepper chicken necks and the bone marrow bun were all amazing we did not even get an entree the small dishes were good enough i am looking forward to returning and trying one of their steaks i also thoroughly enjoyed the slow gin negroni is for dessert the pineapple rum sabayon was also a nice way to end things the service staff was cool too we enjoyed their conversation and they were very informative burnt ends is doing something not many restaurants are doing anywhere in the world they are deserved of all the accolades they receive\",\"burnt ends is the best place i have eaten in singapore the eel and bone marrow bite is one of the best things i have ever eaten we ate the chef is select which turned out to be almost everything on the menu this ended up being incredibly expensive especially with wine which had a serious like everywhere else in singapore markup but still worth every penny highlights sanger was delicious eel and bone marrow was phenomenal you will never forget eating this the crab was fantastic especially with sourdough to mop up the sauce burnt ends chocolate fondant was special gooey but burnt and crisp in the very best way the somm was charming gave us wonderful reccs and even served us a half bottle when he would normally only serve a full service was impeccable an institution for the best reasons\",\"nothing much to add to the reviews here but this is as amazing as it gets get the beef marmalade and bone marrow burger and of course a steak\",\"yum yum and yum burnt ends was a fabulous meal in singapore we tried making reservations starting a month out and everything was booked we were bummmed but figured we would still give it a shot when we were in town we were able to walk right in with no wait we were seated at the high top tables but if we had chosen to wait an hour we could have had regular seating as well if you are in town without reservations i would still give it a shot bc it was so worth it if you have a choice go with the table top seating you can watch the magic happen cocktails were phenomenal one has burnt sage on top super fragrant and we really loved the small plates and sharable plates the jacobs ladder meat from between the ribs was fatty and delicious and had a great mustard sauce the jerk chicken with the citrus cream sauce was also fabulous the pulled pork sandwich was huge and had a ton of flavor the king crab with brown butter was a delicious main course decent amount of crab and the butter sauce also had capers yum we are so glad we took a shot and were able to walk in and experience this place on our one night in singapore\",\"this is one of the most disappointing experiences i have had in singapore as well as dining at the worlds is top  when your reservation that you make  months in advance says bar seating what they really mean is wall seating your seat is an uncomfortable bar stool at an iron grate shelf facing a wall when we asked if there was any other options the hostess rudely stated that was what our reservations were made for fine seat us then our cocktails were weak and when we asked for a dirty martini we were told they only brine they had in the restaurant was jalapeo brine we tried several starters grissinni simple and tasty jerk chicken pass it was a super fatty piece of chicken smeared in mayo and the beef marmalade which was the best dish we sampled the marmalade was delicious we also tried the sanger sandwich while good it was missing an element of flavor maybe some spice could highlight the flavors and last we were recommended to try the venison unfortunately the venison was brought out with little actual meat and instead a huge bone that apparently accounted for the majority of the weight that we paid for i expect more at this price point and for the hype what a huge disappointment save your money and get some actual quality food elsewhere i would have preferred roasted meat from a hawker stall\",\"very nice australian cuisine booking is essential we booked  months ahead and managed to only get a bar seat that means you sit facing the blank wall on a bar stool not the best for a social outing the food was good and so was the service i found it a bit rich we started off with the quails egg caviar followed by grissini taramasalata both good the beef marmalade and leek hazelnut truffle were also good i found the pulled pork burger ordinary the king crab and garlic brown butter was excellent but rich the final dish of onglet was also nice over all it was a nice meal although most uncomfortable on a bar stool\",\"i love dining alone and this night i happened to walk in at just the right time to catch one of the last seats available for dinner it was outside which was fine as it was a cool march evening i saw many people being turned away after i sat down i ordered the miso eggplant the romaine salad the steak and a mint ice cream for dessert this was a bit too much food for one i realized late but it was fabulous i specifically asked the waiter for the smallest cut of steak and he recommended it be done medium rare which i do not usually do but it was so so so good the steak comes with a small salad so the romaine salad was really unnecessary it would have been helpful if the waiter had told me the romaine was the least successful of the items it was strangely salty make the time for this place when you are in singapore\",\"my favourite restaurant in singapore burnt ends gets it all right the meat and seafood will blow your socks off dishes that at first appear super simple are after diving in deeply complex this started with snow crab leg in herb butter roasted leek eggplant and then moved on to the burnt ends sanger amazing rump cap sounds like a lot for two but the dishes are small and perfect to share we finished with the sugar cake and smoked ice cream the cocktails and wines are phenomenal but it is the experience and theatre going on in the kitchen as you sit at the bar that seals the deal go here yeah it is not cheap but it should not be\",\"wow wow   amazing phenomenal delicious mouth watering an experience you cannot miss if you do not go you messed up\",\"there are times when you do pay lots for a meal and leaving the place feeling worth every single cents i would say this is the place every thing from the food the service and the ambiance was just wonderful we were lucky enough to get the seats closes to where the action is seeing how the order comes in the sou chef calling out the orders the busy cooks scrambling to get every piece perfect and back to the chef finally taste to serve think there are more than enough reviews already will just add extremely detail pictures to tempt whose unconvinced to part with their hard earn so i wo not say more except the g beef though a s  hit was the best also a surprise was that the dessert was good too you would think bbq guys cannot do desserts think again great job guys just go ahead and include  no need to put a big note and hint of no service charge you deserve every cent of it do not be shy as you are not on your qs my son loved their food and decide to do a video of them youtu be jawatyz ce\",\"as its name implies this park features a gigantic sculpture of a merlion singapore is mascot it is a fictional creature that is half fish hence the word mer from sea and half lion here it spouts a vigorous stream of water all day long which makes for a must do selfie or instagram shot as it is also flanked by singapore is soaring skyline yes it is touristy but it is free best of all there are multiple vantage points whether directly underneath it along the water at an observation deck that juts into the bay or along the jubilee bridge which forms part of a pedestrian loop around the bay just keep the selfie sticks and duckface hidden away please\",\"entering my th year in singapore the merlion and its associated water views never cease to captivate me singapore is mascot provides one of the best ground level viewpoints of the mbs and artscience museum the lotus flower that looks more like a garlic bulb the merlion name is derived from mer meaning the sea and lion the oft regaled king of the jungle the mer body represents singapore is origins as a fishing village whilst the lion head represents singapore is original name singapura lion city there are several merlion to see in the park but the large one closest to the water is the original that attracts all the attention and supplies all of the photo opportunities tourist suggestion once you have completed this part walk towards the fullerton bay hotel and check out clifford pier this is one of the locations of mahatma ghandi is ashes there is a plaque with some information which tells more of the story go find it\",\"it is one of the must visit attractions in singapore everyone come here to take a photo in front of statue again it was a must see attractions if you are in si\",\"lovely fountain with a fantastic view of the city behind it and the marina in the front this place is packed with tourists but well worth a visit\",\"the merlion is the symbol of singapore part myth part fantasy all roar this is another symbol that is synonymous to this country merlion park is on the bayfront it is small and it is crowded that said it is a must to visit you will be jockeying for a position to take a picture with the merlion pose capture post your friends will be jealous\",\"mermaid and lion half fish half lion statue is a welcome gate to singapore river it is a sign of good luck and protection the word singa is lion which symbolizes the singapore when they first discovered the land in the early day now the merlion park is major tourist attraction it is great area to visit at day and night at nighttime they have the laser light show can be seen towards the marina bay sand hotel the statue was move from the original location to current location many tourist put their hand up like catching the water or a head wash anyway you like the park can be access through the fullerton hotel tunnel if you try to cross fullerton road there no crossing above just go to ground floor tunnel to cross from the hotel\",\"merlion park is a beautiful waterfront area of singapore with the main attraction being the merlion which is the iconic symbol of singapore although it is essentially a photo stop place hounded by tourists and selfie snappers the backdrop of the city behind the merlion and the view across the river to marina bay sands are worth a stop here\",\"the location of the merlion is in an excellent spot you can have the merlion statue the sands the lotus all in one photo it does get crowded through the day so it is best to go there either early morning or in the evening around   hours you also have a great view at night when the sands does its nightly light show the only drawback to watching the light show on the merlion side is that you wo not be able to hear the music well happy travels everyone\",\"this is obviously a must do when visiting singapore for the first time whether or not you think it is touristy there is history here i recommend visiting at night and watching the light show from across the water at the sands it can be a little crowded here but it is a cute place\",\"as a tourist yeah make it one of your sites do not go with a tour you it can easily take the metro their and or taxi better to walk on your own plenty to do and sightseeing it is close to one of the other malls if you want to take a stroll it was a pretty long walk but we walked if you want souvenirs get it from there not too pricey do not go overboard thought it gets crowded so i suggest you either go early or later mid day gets hot have to try the bread worth the eggs and coconut cream\",\"really nice to walk past especially while it is dark outside if you are lucky you can also catch the show with the marina bay sands light changes really nice and worth the stroll past\",\"the national symbol of singaporefun fact from wiki merlion is a statue that symbolizes the country of singapore it has the head of a lion and the body of a fish singapore is name originated from singapura which means lion city the fish on the other hand symbolizes singapore is humble beginnings as a fishing village there are several merlions in singapore but there are two located in the marina bay a major tourist attraction for this reason these two merlions are the most popular ones plus the bigger one located in sentosa expect a lot of tourists fighting for their chance to have a selfie or group pictures with the bigger merlion sprouting water from its mouth but as any other tourist or yelper for that matter you do what you got to do ready say cheese click\",\"the merlion is one of the famous landmarks in singapore there will be plenty of other tourist taking selfies and photos of the merlion i was here both during the late morning and evening btw it was super hot humid during the daytime here personally visiting the merlion during the evening is slightly better since you can catch the spectra water show from a far distance and marina bay sands light show at pm the mrt is not really close by the merlion i took the bus getting here and i think it is the best option overall definitely visit the merlion while in singapore you will probably spend   minutes here\",\"lots of people and great people watching we took a lot of fun photos with the fountain and then went on the  boat cruise afterwards well worth it it gave a history of singapore and unforgettable views of the bay and canals i would definitely recommend this to every visitor this place is a must\",\"the merlion is the unofficial mascot of singapore singapore or singapura is named after a mythological lion the merlion is half lion half fish visit the original statue fountain at merlion park the lion head spews out water into the kallang river visitors can take pictures with the iconic merlion by day or night i love the park best at night because it is lit beautifully sometimes it can get really crowded but it is lovely to be by the riverfront and see the lights from boats and the gorgeous singapore skyline\",\"the merlion park is a definite must do in singapore you cannot not go to singapore without seeing the merlion and the small park caters to tourists well there are large stairs leading down to the water that make for excellent image composition strategy there is also a little pier where you can get the best photos of he merlion obviously it is really busy here but people come and go quite quickly so you are bound to get a good shot if you are a little patient there are so many poses i have seen using the streaming water from the merlion is mouth get creative lol there are restaurants nearby that are expensive but i think bringing your own food and eating in the small park or on the stairs would be doable\",\"a place where you can enjoy the view of some famous spot in singapore lots of cafe surrounding it too many tourist\",\"the merlion was under construction when i went in late january i only found out when i got there can you imagine the disappointment but even so the view more than made up for it the merlion is right next to the bay and across the bay you could see the singapore flyer and marina bay sands there is an area where you can go down the steps and touch the water there is no fence or anything so be careful if you have kids behind the merlion there was a smaller one dog size so a bunch of people was just crowded around that taking pics the esplanade bridge and jubilee bridge is right there so you can easily take one of those bridges then take the helix bridge to go to marina bay sands the bridges are very short so the whole walk probably took under  minutes with pictures along the way\",\"there is no shortage of things to do and see in beautiful singapore visiting merlion park is yet another place that displays its beauty our first visit was on a beautiful wednesday evening in february like most places in singapore merlion park offers no shortage of places to eat this is one of those pass through attractions unless you plan on dining there i recommend staying just long enough to take in the scenery and photo ops then walk up the road to la pau sat for some satay from pm\",\"some people say this is a tourist trap and disappointing but i found it worth going you can see the lion and beautiful marina baysands in the back if it is not too busy you can take pictures without people obstructing the view there is a boat goes around and you can see the lion really well without the crowds however they do not take credit cards so remember to bring cash if you wanna do the boat ride the night show was rather disappointing so i would not really recommend wasting your time waiting for the show\",\"ah tai split off from tian tian  stalls down the star here is also the chicken rice plate similar to tian tian it is   for a small theirs comes with chicken broth on the side it is traditional chicken fat rice with breast meat with bone and skin and cucumbers their chicken was more tender and more flavorful and the rice was richer i think the portion was bigger too i definitely preferred ah tai over tian tian also extra points for having plastic utensils during the coronavirus outbreak the other place still had regular utensils yes more environmentally friendly but i would like to limit disease transmission pro tip grab a cold beer from the stall next door to go with your food\",\"if you are at maxwell food centre and having a hard time deciding between all the hainanese chicken rice stalls let me do the honors of narrowing it down for you you should be standing between ah tai is and tian tian is both stalls are literally two spaces apart from each other ah tai used to work for tian tian as a cook for  years until he was let go by management and started his own stall both are pretty good but ah tai gives you more rice and a cup of soup plus there are no lines at all i would say give tian tian a try but when you are craving chicken rice and cannot be bothered to stand in a line go to ah tai is you will not be disappointed\",\"i liked ah tai is more than the famous tian tian chicken rice my friend waited  minutes to get his food i waited  seconds we both tasted it side by side to see which one we liked more and we both agreed it was ah tai is this place is slightly cheaper and a lot tastier we felt like tian tian was good but lacked the flavor that ah tai is had ah tai even has an extra soup which was also a fantastic compliment to the meal i would come back here\",\"based on some youtube videos and the yelp rating we decided to give it a try this place is kinda hard to find with google navigation ah tai can be found right in the center of hawker center this place was opened by someone who used to work at the famous tian tian hainan chickenflavor   the chicken is very standard what is special is the rice which was very flavorful wait and line  the wait is pretty decent we waited  minutes at pm on saturday the wait at tian tian was  minutes price    for a set chicken rice soup and veggie is unbeatable and you get the best value of the price for sure comparison to tian tian tian tian is rice tastes even better and is more flavorful as they have adjusted the recipe multiple times since opening however the price is slightly more expensive with  if you want the veggies and chicken the portions are slightly less there and you wait faaar longer overall tian tian is not worth the wait and is recommend ah tai if you crave or want to experience hainan chicken\",\"best hainan chicken rice i have tried so far tian tian is more popular but the rice is not as good as ah tai both are good but ah tai wins easily the sauce is also better rice is flavorful and had a great texture\",\"with the unfortunate close proximity to the famous tian tian chicken rice this place never gets the respect i believe the chicken itself at both places are comparable to each other amazing however i would give the edge to ah tai for the following reason no ridiculous line waited only  minutes during the busy lunch rush side dishes received a free chicken soup and the optional veggie price to food ratio about  more overall if you have one meal at the maxwell food court tian tian is the popular notable one to go to however ah tai is the good locals spot to hit up\",\"best hainan chicken i have ever had in my life if you are from los angeles you are probably familiar with savoy is hainan chicken which locals always rave about i honestly have never liked that place but if you like savoy you are definitely going to love ah tai the funny thing is ah tai is on the  michelin bib gourmand but the guide has it listed as ah gong which means the same thing as ah tai weird that michelin would make that error but i spent hours trying to find ah gong in singapore to no avail only to accidentally realize that it is three stalls away from tian tian hainan chicken for some reason tian tian is more popular and has a way longer line but i can tell you it is all hype i tried both and i would rather eat savoy than the atrocity tian tian is serving ah tai was so good we got a second plate and devoured it in minutes the chicken the rice everything was perfectly cooked and flavored you are missing out if you come to singapore and do not give this place a shot\",\"back for our yearly trip and since we were close to maxwell food court i decided to head in to grab some hainan chicken and rice once we entered i quickly saw a long ass line that had formed for tian tian since it was a hot and muggy day typical sing weather i quickly remembered a good friend mentioning that ah tai was as good if not better than tian tian glanced over and saw that there were only  people in line i made a b line over pricing wise both are similarly priced iirc but ah tai did not have a long ass queue within  minutes i was inside an air conditioned taxi and headed back to the hotel room to eat at first glance both places offer a cheap and tasty lunch dinner the main difference between the two was how fragrant the rice is at ah tai i do not remember tian tian being as fragrant and actually thought the rice texture at tian tian was slightly off the last time i ate there the chicken at both places were good tender and moist but ah tai does throw in some veggies which is a nice addition to the regular dish will have to do a head to head comparison next year but for now ah tai reigns king in my book for chicken and rice\",\"it is awesome seems like many of these other reviews tell the story and accurately too shorter lines better food not by much though hainanese chicken rice is delicious pretty much anywhere we actually bought a do it yourself package from a grocery store in singapore and made it ourselves once we got home even that was yummy nevertheless ah tai is arguably the best of the best you wo not go wrong\",\"tl dr perfect for an expat ready to dive into the famed chicken rice dish super affordable and hits the spot definitely at least on par with its more famous neighbor tian tian this was all  sgd   usd i came to ah tai on my first night in singapore a friday night eager to dive into the hawker culture in all honesty i was planning on going to tian tian but they had closed  minutes before i arrived which was around  pm oh well i was not disappointed in the slightest and absolutely loved my food the chicken was packed with flavor and it was clear that the chef s at ah tai were professionals from the first bite as others have mentioned the rice had a great fragrance aroma to it which made the entire dish even more flavorful the broth was flavorful yet not too salty which is a pet peeve of mine in these sorts of dishes while i also personally enjoyed the chili sauce it can definitely be too spicy for some patrons so be aware of that overall a wonderful place to be and i will definitely return in the future\",\"that is some good chicken tian tian was closed when i visited but i read that ah tai hainanese chicken rice was up there it did not disappoint the chicken was flavorful and moist the best part was the aroma of the rice that they serve with the chicken they have probably served millions of hainanese chicken rice they have reached perfection\",\"unfortunately tian tian chicken rice stall was still closed when i visited maxwell food centre the second time that i was there i read online that ah tai was still a good option for chicken and rice i got here by pm before the dinner rush and the line was not super long yet the line was long by the time i finished eating but the lines seemed to move quickly from my observation the chicken and rice was good and cheap i e   sgd for medium size the chicken was moist and delicious not bad overall\",\"a friend of mine visited singapore before me and told me that if i did anything on my trip it had to be visiting at least one hawker centre we were recommended the maxwell centre and headed this way to see what we could grub on before our buffet dinner we are little fatties we know like many before us we were hoping to check out tian tian do not judge us for being basic anthony bourdain was a gd international treasure unfortunately for us it was closed on the monday we visited luckily we spotted ah tai just a few stalls down our hainanese chicken cravings needed to be met so we handed over a cook  sgd and were presented with a lovely plate of rice with a good serving of chicken and bok choy a side of broth and a few dipping sauces the broth was nice and light flavorful but not salty it was just a bit too toasty in the centre for me to really enjoy hot broth the bok choy was great and paired really nicely with the flavors of the tender chicken and aromatic and soft rice and of course the dipping sauces were an excellent addition to the meal but i am just a sucker for dipping sauces my sister and i shared this plate and it was just enough for a nice snack for the both of us it was so tasty we considered getting another but figured we should try some other things while we were there for  though ah tai is probably the tastiest most slammin deal you will find in all of singapore\",\"i do not know chicken rice but i feel like i got a full education of it here rice cooked in chicken stock with some chicken and veggies on the side there was also a bowl of soup which i wish i could get more of the chicken and rice were delicious and the sambal was excellent another sub  meal that i wish i ordered more of\",\"been meaning to write this review for a while revisited ah tai in my recent singapore trip i can confirm that ah tai still has it going on do not be enthralled by the long line at tian tian mostly because of the bourdain effect also rip  the chicken rice at ah tai is better and minus a wait chicken is so tender and the rice is just right they also have a combo set you can order for   sgd with some veggies and soup either way you cannot go wrong\",\"only idiots aka tourist or someone who just came back from a very long time travel will go to tian tian the chef behind tian tian success ah tai not only had emulated the juicy yet dry aromatic yet not overwhelming bloodless yet not over poached firm yet tender uniformed fresh yet not chicken smelly ah tai has bring this hainanese chicken rice a few notch higher do not trust any locals who tell you their fav chicken rice stall near here or there is better cos they know nothing ah tai is poached chicken is well massage before steaming only special bred chicken from a secret farm is used no other chicken rice stall in singapore use this expensive stock\",\"chicken rice singapore is national dish you have not been if you have not tried it dare i reject the opinions of the travel channel gurus and side with the locals look this place is better outstanding chicken tender and juicy boiled in an incredible broth of chicken stock its collagen lemongrass and other herbs served with a side of rice cooked in the same stock and a bowl of the magical elixir itself add a sweet molasses sauce and homemade zesty herbaceous fresh siracha and all is right in singapore incredible complexity and just plain delish a bargain at   sgd per set half and whole chicken on offer lines get long  min plus do not worry it wo not be long before what is arguably the best chicken rice per locals is entering your drooling mouth maxwells hawker center two stalls to the left of the tourist spot note be willing to share your table with strangers outstanding\",\"the owner of this stall used to work st the famous tian tian a few counters away today the queue at tian tian lasts anywhere between  minutes at opening at am or mid afternoon and  minutes meal times its prices are the highest among all the hainanese chicken rice stalls at maxwell although that is still most reasonable they only give out the chilli and dark soy sauces upon request although that is very much part of the dish there is never a queue at ah tai so is it worth it if you are not a foodie the answer is hell no on the other hand if you can tell subtle differences in the texture of the chicken the fragrance of the rice or the degree of kick in the chilli sauce or if you just line up servings from the various chicken rice stalls at maxwell tian tian ah tai heng heng you would have to say tian tian is the best lah unfortunately ah tai would come third although on its own it is not bad\",\"came by for their hainan chicken the other day and it was a tasty experience located  stalls down from tian tian this stall had no line word on the street is that the chef used to work at tian tian the drumstick chicken rice was quite tasty chicken was very smooth and had a nice gravy like sauce over it the rice was fragrant soft and flavorful my entree also came with a small soup which was a great way to finish off a light lunch maxwell center is not air conditioned but they do have fans humidity and temperature might be a issue for foreigners maybe get a cold drink before ordering the meal   sgd for a drumstick rice with soup\",\"food    service    value    decor    overall    i have done t t before and anyone who knows me knows i do not do lines unless it is a le ah tai did the trick basically just as good you know i am right but basically no line do not be a lemming save yourself the fifteen minutes and get this\",\"although this place is overhyped i was not expecting much so my experience was neither overwhelming nor underwhelming fortunately there was not a long line when i came so i got my meal almost immediately after ordering up front i ordered the cha siew chicken with rice and it kind of tasted like what i have already had before the cha siew and chicken were cooked well the chicken was tender and the soy sauce was sweeeet so it is a bit different than what i have had i think honey might be in the marinade recipe i prefer the cha siew over the chicken because the flavoring was bomb but the entire meal was very satisfying for me the reviews here are mixed but i actually enjoy and appreciate simple affordable foods and that is exactly what chef chan is belief is i am pretty glad a non expensive nor fancy fine dining restaurant like simple hawker chan received a michelin star it is worth checking out and i do not know why you would not want to spend less than usd  for a meal because honestly what can that get you especially in america nothing i personally recommend\",\"on my trip to singapore i was determined to have the famous cheapest michelin star meal i was not able to locate the original stall in the hawker market until after they sold out but came to their chain storefront instead to have the faux experience the chicken itself was fantastic and extremely flavorful i could eat that stuff for days but the experience overall felt a little bit like they turned the original hawker chan into a mcdonalds it is commercial and the food though tasty came out a bit cold i am still extremely happy i was able to eat here because it was extremely tasty but the commercialization is a little bit disappointing to me\",\"probably one of the cheapest michelin star meal you can find for  went around lunch time and the place was packed we waited in line for at least half an hr trying to find a table do not we ordered the soya chicken with rice roasted pork with rice and soy sauce vegetables as a cantonese i pretty much grew up eating roasted meats and chicken and i have to say the food quality was underwhelming the chicken was not really tender and actually somewhat dry same thing goes with the roasted pork there could have been more layering with the lean and fatty parts so the meat is not too dry you cannot beat the price of  but honestly there are so many hawkers in singapore that offer much cheaper and flavorful options the seating lining up situation was also very hectic given that there were a lot of people trying to find seats with trays of food in their hands in a very cramped space it was an interesting experience given the chain is fame but honestly i would not be back\",\"get your fix from a michelin star cook the chicken is superb order a whole dark sauced chicken and slowly dip in the sauce to savor the taste the meat is tender and cooked just right compliment it with a plate of noodles cooked to perfection go early or the chicken runs out  starts for me\",\"hawker chan was my second stop on my quest to find the best chicken rice in singapore and i was massively disappointed we ordered a soya chicken rice their specialty and while the chicken was nicely cooked the rice was bland and the sauce did nothing to help the dish just okay is the best description i can provide for how the dish tasted overall for the cheapest michelin star meal in the world i was disappointed there are so many other things i would rather eat for the same amount of money around  singapore dollars not worth the trek\",\"it is everything i was promised probably one of the best meals i have ever had especially when it comes down to about  u s a meal soya sauce chicken w rice this must be the tastiest chicken i have ever had especially their skin whatever they marinated would definitely has a touch of magic only complaint is that they do it the inexpensive way which is just directly butcher the chicken so you have a lot of bones to go through   char siew hor fun incredibly flavorful hard to be disappointed with such an explosion of flavor and the meat was cooked to perfection aiyu aloe vera super super refreshing the jelly tastes like chrysanthemum with chunks of aloe i highly recommend getting this with any of their dishes i think it is the perfect palate cleanser at the end of extremely hearty flavorsalthough i only have a few days out here definitely going to make a second stop before i leave a must absolutely worth it\",\"the famous hawker chani was in singapore and had to stop by i heard they had a michelin star i got super lucky when i came in the line was small i waited about  minutes to order and got my food  minutes after that i ordered the soya chicken and rice the michelin star dish i got it to go because although the line was short the place was packed the food so to start it had alot of bones the chicken was cooked well not dry at all the flavor was very generic i tasted the soya sauce and it was not anything impressive i was left a little disappointed i may have set my expectations too high overall it is ok just ok there is other hawkers some tasting better in my opinion\",\"simple food expect a line have you ever eaten at a michelin starred spot for  not only is singapore a dope vacation destination but it has cheap delicious food with numerous and cheap michelin starred restaurants it is cool that this restaurant is in chinatown so you can shop and continue your food journey while in singapore after waiting in the line that was literally out the door roughly  minutes i ordered the soya chicken and rice which is what gave this place its michelin star when i finally received my food about  minutes later i struggled for a few minutes finding a table this place is packed seriously good luck finding a seat as people tend to save them for their multiple person families kinda rude but smart i will say that the chicken was good but not very unique and definitely not worth the wait it was roasted chicken rice with soya sauce half a boiled egg fresh slices of cucumber and roasted peanuts super random items and plating but i suppose when they are churning out hundreds plus plates a day they could care less there are tons of other hawkers that serve the same food and you will get it in  minutes without a wait suggestions take your food to go and go sit on a bench or in the food court nearby to eat it it will save you time and energy from wrestling for seats with other foreigners or if you just want to try the dish go to any hawker stall\",\"located on a busy street in chinatown it is easy to pass right by the unassuming michelin star owning liao fan hawker chan due to the notoriety we were warned that the line may be long multiple hours luckily we went at an off time and therefore did not have it wait we walked right up to the counter and ordered the famous chicken and rice compared to other dishes we had in the area i found the simplicity of the dish surprising while the flavors were very subtly the chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious i do not think i would wait hours to get the dish again especially since it is a common local dish but if you have never been and want to experience the the cheapest michelin starred meal in the word i would suggest stopping by\",\"i had just gone to maxwell hawker center at  am to try the hainan chicken rice at tian tian then decided to walk through chinatown to try the soya sauce chicken at hawker chan it was a short walk but i stopped several times to buy souvenirs i got to hawker chan around   am and there were about  people waiting in line it was early and the restaurant was fairly empty and the line moved quickly i had to try their famous soya sauce chicken that won them their michelin star and boy was it good the skin reminded me of the skin from a roast chicken or duck it is better than most of the soya sauce chickens i have had in san francisco the sauce is a mix between savory and sweet i feel that most of the soya sauce chickens at home were mostly salty and one dimensional the hawker chan chicken was moist and juicy portion size is on the smaller side but i was not too hungry after already eating at tian tian about an hour earlier i also ordered the green papaya with pork ribs soup fried dumplings and a chinese flower tea my entire meal came out to   sgd the chicken was only  sgd about   usd in november  it is insane there is no way i could get a chicken rice plate for under  in san francisco much less at a michelin star restaurant definitely a must try if you are in singapore\",\"i do not know i did not get the hype chicken rice is extremely bland i did tons of research prior to our trip to singapore and this is the dish to try but it just did nothing for me the restaurant is extremely crowded surely due to the michelin star and you have to stalk a table to sit down food is prepared quickly but generally you will need to share a table with a stranger and have someone standing over you waiting for you to finish it is not worth the hassle in my opinion it is located on the bustling food street in chinatown and there are tons of other options\",\"the cheapest meal at a michelin starred street food stall anytime i get to try something that is both michelin and cheap than i do it i ordered the signature dish the soya sauce chicken which cost   usd for the entire set it does not get much cheaper than that the meal was delicious i ordered a second dish to eat because it was so tasty the hor fun noodles and char siew was a great choice as well i actually preferred the noodles compared to rice after tasting both be prepared to wait for a little while because this place is very popular it can crowded but i think they did a great job of serving as many

veggies it is simple yet one of the best i have ever had i am going to say that the biggest difference i taste in this chicken is the soy sauce they use i think that is their secret they pour it onto

with a nice balance of sweet and savory served with rice to soak up the wonderfully fragrant sauce it is a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors the char siew pork was nicely charred with a delightful caramelization on the outside a great side dish while they do not focus on presentations the tastes are exemplary expect a wait for this critically acclaimed dish but it is definitely worth it\",\"finally after a few years of being selected as michelin star restaurant i got to try their famous chicken rice i arrived here  minutes before their opening time but a long queue was already there when i arrived they got really busy within one hour of opening and people came with large group could not sit together my experience on the day i visited was underwhelming i kept thinking why am i paying  for this it used to be  when i tried five years ago food now is not as good as it used to be why did i stand in line so long for this food tourists from all over the world came here to experience it could be a personal preference i prefer another chicken rice from somewhere else\",\"street food vendors with one michelin star rating it was an honor for the vendor to near the one star french world wide recognition you will not able to believe one michelin star restaurant only cost  sg to eat do not try to come here at  to  pm it will be long line waiting for the food i would said come here after lunch hour rush i was here at  pm only  people ahead of me i got the sweet sauce chicken noodle the noodle is hong kong thin egg noodle when it mixed with the chicken sauce it really delicious the chicken is soft and tender plenty of dark sauce surrounding it you can ask them to put some sambal next to the noodle it is great to mixed in to the noodle the good is excellent the wait is short due to not in the rush lunch hour\",\"i mistakenly arrived at this location shortly after  a m and was surprised to see how beautiful new and not crowded this location was it turns out that this is not the original location it is built for tourists and serving coca cola in an air conditioning environment ready to accommodate dozens of tourists i inquired with the order taker whether or not this was the original location and i found out that the original location is located just across the street and up an escalator newest store and then to the left so in conclusion buyer beware as always in this case this beautiful looking restaurant is not the original one\",\"i heard about this coveted michelin star meal soya sauce chicken at liao fan hawker chan for a long time and had to give it a try in case you do not know singaporean is consider this dish to be a national dish you definitely need to try it while in singapore and why not go to the best there are several locations and while this is not the original i am almost certain that this is just as good we did not know that there was more than one location and we just put the name in grab the driver informed us that this place is really great you can only imagine how confused we were to pull up to a mall vs chinatown however it was  degrees outside and thought this was just fine we wanted to beat the rush and arrived about  am there were about  people in line in front of us and the line moved really quickly the menu is pretty basic you will pick chicken or pork and then your choice of either rice or noodles i went with their famous chicken and rice the soya sauce chicken is really great with a nice balance of sweet and savory served with rice to soak up the wonderfully sauce it is a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors the one thing that surprised me was that there are bones in this chicken however that probably is what made it even tastier an order of this dish sets you back about  usd which is absolutely crazy talk i do not know how they keep it so inexpensive this is a must visit but if you want to keep it authentic head for chinatown although i am sure they taste the same\",\"chicken is so soft and mushy sauce is so sweet and dimensionless best part of the meal was the rice noodles good texture and papaya soup\",\"the food has been phenomenal laksa was awesome it was cheap yet heavy\",\"when we got to this hawker center we immediately saw sungei road laksa as a line had formed after a small wait we got out bowl of delicious laksa the soup in the dish was delicious and had a nice coconut flavor to it the noodles were also smooth and the protein went well with dish overall it was a good bowl of laksa for the price you pay would eat here again if i am in singapore again\",\"laksa is a popular southeast asia spicy noodle soup with rice noodle in coconut milk curry soup i am not a big fan of curry but had to try it out it was good and definitely worth a try if you can handle some heat even though i do not like curry i still enjoyed it sungei road seems to be the best but we also tried the laksa in the colony buffet in ritz carlton and thought the quality is pretty similar but this laksa is a fraction of the price  for a small bowl\",\"laska is not my thing and after trying this still not my thing i love noodles and soup but i prefer simpler and clear broth although i am not a fan of this soup i can see why it is popular with the flavor profile of curry coconut and chili bowls are small but good size if you are from the americas think of it as a small chicken bowl size or a bowl of soboro don noodles are cut only utensils available are spoons which fits perfectly for every bite and easily able to get a spoonful of noodle and fish balls and cakes sgd how can you go wrong with something flavorful if it was my kind of food i would eat this again and again just like the locals do not be alarmed at the long line they serve it rather quickly it ai not no howlin rays kind of wait if you are from la\",\"laksa here is so good tasty and rich in flavor line is always long but goes by pretty fast bowl is a bit small but its not pricy either love the combination of the fish cake cockles creamy coconut curry milk broth spices and noodles everything blended so well just slurp up all the liquid yumminess delicious and worth a visit\",\"sungei road laksa was one of the more popular laksa selling places i found online when i arrived there was already a sizable line that had formed after i got in line another large wave of people appeared out of nowhere and the line pretty much doubled in size the amount of people waiting here speaks to its popularity the laksa was super cheap and looked delicious however the portion size was extremely small they do not give you chopsticks and only provide you with a small soup spoon to slurp up all of the noodles in the bowl but i did not find this to be a problem at all the coconut flavor was pretty strong but after i finished my bowl i found that the overall flavor was not as strong as i was expecting i liked the spices and seasoning in the broth as they were not overwhelmingly heavy i thought that i would still be starving after downing such a tiny bowl but i was surprisingly content that being said i easily could have had another bowl for me sungei road laksa was a delicious introduction to laksa first time trying it although the line here may deter some visitors i would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you are in the area\",\"the bowls of laksa at sungei road laksa located in a small hawker center are small but packed with flavor you can tell this place is popular just from the lanes they have set up to organize guests waiting in line and for a cheap uniform price of  you get a flavor packed bowl of rice noodles in coconut milk curry broth topped with fish cake cockles herbs and chili paste on the side interestingly they also have a big sign on their stall that says no chopsticks and you are only given a spoon to eat the dish ensuring that you slurp up all the liquidy goodness\",\"best laksa of life extremely affordable  for a small bowl broth made traditionally with charcoal creamy coconut milk paired with spices herbs and spicy sambal together create a sublime bowl of laksa i love the hint of freshness from raw clams sungei road laksa do not give out chopsticks but rather pre cut noodles so you can inhale it with a spoon the flavour profile really changes with every bite sambal clam herbs ouff tofu one of the best thing i ate in singapore i licked the bowl when no one is looking definitely worth traveling for\",\"a little shop amongst   other little stands serving amazing authentic food no frills they are not there to entertain you walk up tell them how many bowls of the delicious yellow soup you would like pay and pick up your food no chopsticks provided at this shop which is kind of funny because you are eating noodles but the spoon will force you to slurp up all the soup along with the noodle not a bad idea actually this bowl is tiny especially compared to american standards i could probably eat  of these alone each bowl is only  so luckily i could comfortably afford all three bowls but i did not i wanted to save my stomach for all the other goodies around here fyi this was a tiny bit spicy just the way i like it and there are little clams in there so yummy in case you are allergic highly recommend\",\"as soon as we landed in singapore we were planning our food adventure the first stop was sungei road laksa which was conveniently located within a  minute walk of our airbnb we shared a bowl of this delicious soup and were tempted to get more but knew that we had many other things to try i loved the creaminess from the coconut milk paired with all the spices to give this dish a nice kick\",\"laksa so good there wo not be a line if you come early at  sgd this is a steal the broth was so creamy and delicious i wish i had doubled down on the order definitely worth the visit\",\"the laksa here is so good and at  it really is a steal it is located at a hawker stall after reading the reviews about it being small my wife and i ordered  between us seemed to be a good amount for breakfast as other reviews mentioned there is no chopsticks but since the noodles were cut up i did not find this to be a problem at all\",\"usd for a bowl of singaporean laksa the stuff most common in the states score the real deal chili turmeric lemongrass other fresh herbs and fermented shrimp all lovingly cooked off before adding shrimp stock clam stock and coconut milk simmered over a charcoal fire a handful of pre cooked noodles warm it by pouring the hot soup over it and dumping it out a few times add cockles and home made fish cake steamed over an open fire a little side of the chili base and that is it no chopsticks you eat this with a spoon the noodles are very soft overcooked by western standards but somehow it just works the flavor a punch to the palate is unmatched in depth and complexity very strong seafood flavor herbaceous notes rich from coconut with a long fermented finish it makes the laksa at the best place in my hometown taste like water in comparison washed down with a fresh squeezed calamansi juice to kill the spice satisfaction achieved ps because of the wood fire the flavor beats that of the more famous three number spot with gordon ramsay affiliation just saying\",\"overall great laksa love the small bowl portion size i didnt enjoy the clams in it however and i picked them all out the food centre had large fans that def helped in cooling the place down to enjoy the food\",\"this is a simple bowl of laksa no frills i like the renovated stall you only have one option now strictly  per bowl no upsize i saw people order two bowls for themselves after they requested for large and was told only one size it is not a big bowl but it can be filling especially when you also order a drink it is without chopsticks also stated clearly at the stall i think they got tired of people asking like the original katong laksa in katong it comes with just bean sprouts sliced fish cake slivers and cockles none of those fancy prawns taupok or even crayfish in other versions mix the chili into the gravy to get the red gravy we are used to seeing it is not that spicy now that i like cockles this is the place for my fix it is chockfull of it the first time i tried it was over  years ago before the renovation and i was not that into it maybe because it was hot and muggy plus i did not care for such a small bowl with simple ingredients then\",\"worth the hype and the trek this seemingly humble bowl of  sd laksa is packed with a heavenly blend of sweet sour spicy and lots of umami after one spoonful i already wanted another bowl i arrived around am and waited only about   minutes building up my appetite as my eyes feasted on watching the aunties stirring and ladling big spoonfuls of soup over a charcoal stove the soup is fills you with umami and fresh cockles and packed with strong flavors of chili and curry all balanced out by sweet coconut milk which lightens the broth to be perfect a noodle soup is good when you drink it to the last drop and that is exactly what it did\",\"good place to get decent laksarecommended but with caveats read on we were out shopping and in the mood for laksa and this place was highly recommended food we kept it simple and ordered only laksa and kueh pie tee from next door the laksa was flavorful even if the gravy was a bit thin it was available with cockles which was disappointing since some places will happily substitute prawns and they sell only one size which i would call small the kueh pie tee was tasty but with ground peanuts is not traditional nonya style cost at  for a bowl the laksa is an excellent value service good the queue was quite long but went quickly the uncles were quick to clear away the bowls after atmosphere this is a coffee shop no aircon overall if you are in the area and craving laksa it is definitely worth stopping here\",\"the laksa here is definitely tasty and rich the laksa gravy is the main character of the dish i would give the taste of this dish  stars however i believe the service can be better when i came here during one of the saturdays the staff was able a bit rude and impatient to us on normal days they are fine i would recommend this to anyone who are looking for tasty and delicious laksa\",\"sungei road laksa is frequently patronised by my family as the laksa gravy is milky rich and mildly spicy note that they wo not give you any chopsticks nor a fork as you will only eat with the given spoon the noodles are all cut into shorter lengths so you will have a easier time consuming it this goodness the price is relatively high for a extremely small bowl of laksa  but who cares if it is delicious\",\"sgd for a delicious bowl of laksa served the traditional way with no chopsticks i came here at   in the morning and there was already a line with  people in front of me with only one item being served and only one size ordering was a breeze when it is your turn just let them know how many bowls when you are standing in the queue watching them prepare a bowl of laksa was fascinating all on its own as they use the broth to blanch your bowl of noodles multiple times the bowl is then topped off with a scoop of cockles and some homemade fish cake and definitely ask to get it spicy since they put the chili paste on the side of the bowl taking my first sip of the broth made me realize that all the laksa i have had before was by no means on par with sungei road the soup has layers upon layers of flavors starting from the sweetness of the coconut to the saltiness of the shrimp paste the complex blends that builds the curry and finally the spiciness from the chili paste eating a bowl of noodles without chopsticks is quite hard especially since the noodles are pretty long do not wear a white shirt by the way the bowl of laksa is small by comparison but a perfect size if you plan on eating something else afterwards\",\"celebrated my nieces birthday dinner here first time to cut and it was awesome kobe beef steak was incredible as was the service thank you\",\"one star michelin steakhouse in mbs expensive high quality steak had the trio of beef to sample different cuts new york sirloin wagyu and usda prime both the ny sirloin and the usda prime were top notch but the wagyu was a let down definitely had better wagyu beef elsewhere portions are small especially when considering the price so overall the steak alone would be  star starters are amazing we ordered the sauted mushroom and patatas bravas definitely one of the best starters i have had in a whileif you do not eat beef the pork chop is excellent juicy and tender with a very good complementary sauce large wine selection but unfortunately sommelier was not the most helpful we asked for a red wine recommendation and he basically pointed to so many that it misses the point of being a recommendationservice was really slow and not attentive definitely not what we would expect from this type of restaurant mediocre service counters the  star starters to give a  rating\",\"i have been craving for steak this past week and finally decided to stop by this location the filet mignon was tender flavorful and delicious i was too hungry so i devoured it before taking any pictures the bone marrow was mouth watering all staff members were attentive without being too excessive glynn the manager at cut definitely made my short visit to singapore a   experience she volunteered to call the souvenir shop within marina bay hotel twice to verify its location and look up some information for me glynn also recommended a popular drink of the restaurant rough love unique and easy to drink you should try it i attached the picture below thank you everyone at the cut for an amazing meal and experience\",\"superb service you cannot expect anything less from wolfgang puck is restaurant and it is at the marina bay sands hotel so the standards are high when dining here plenty of steaks to choose from they also make some good cocktails again service was great they kept coming back ensuring that my needs were met reservations are recommended although i am sure they can squeeze you in\",\"just wanted to say thanks to mary and the people at cut who made for a very special evening had the porterhouse for  perfectly cooked to medium rare service was excellent was given a nice little surprise at the end of the meal to celebrate an engagement i am glad i chose this place it was worth it\",\"one of the best steaks i have ever tasted we went with the porterhouse steak and it was good for two people portion wise it comes with two sauces and  different mustards the steak was very well prepared in terms of flavor and we really enjoyed it ordered kale and the patata as sides the patata was really good as well finally went with the chocolate and the caramel dishes for dessert they were ok but nothing special would not mind skipping them next time\",\"i recommend making reservations because as a walk in they are most likely going to seat you in the lounge where shoppers gawk at you through the window as they walk by not a great ambiance all things considered the steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it i would not order it again truthfully the menu is pretty straightforward i wanted the porterhouse so jerry and i ordered the portion for  little did we know it is  piece cooked and divided in half i wanted rare and he wanted medium rare it was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it they then walked over to jerry to confirm his medium rare wishes so they can continue to cook it i got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items i forgot what it was but i remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste presentation and quality of the food the bone marrow was tender it melted in my mouth it was so rich i felt guilty as i was eating it but it was too good to stop i wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though the porterhouse was tender their house made steak sauce was delicious the steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so i kept adding finally time for desserts i was the only one that wanted desserts i ordered the chocolate souffl knew that it would take at least  minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out the portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but i do not share when it comes to food so i enjoyed it orgasmiscally until it was all gone their crime fraiche was thick and creamy the chocolate sauce was rich the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w the huge decadent and delicious chocolate souffl service was impeccable  off for mastercard users thanks for allowing us to expense this love my company\",\"mr puck is next to arnie one of the more famous and successful austrian exports he now ranks amongst the best chefs restaurateurs in the world and spago in la is an institution that has found worldwide fame now present in many locations singapore included another venture of his is cut focusing on steak we booked there for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed it tremendously as there are many other reviews raving about this place i am trying to keep it short hoping to contribute to a coherent picture service is very friendly efficient and which i always find refreshing at celebrity restaurants authentic no snobbishness just smiles all around staff greeting repeat customers with true joy of seeing each other again a rare trait at this kind of place interior is modern elegant darkish with great lighting and the wonderful celebrity portrait photography by martin schoeller featured in the entire location and on menus food is delicious i wo not go into detail we had crab shrimp cocktail starters steak and dessert and it arrives pretty fast which we did not expect with the restaurant being very busy the wine list features a great many choices and we really enjoyed our pinot noir from california prices for wine are on the steep side but i guess this is not news to anyone in singapore i really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics e g david bowie and contemporary e g coldplay a daring choice but a good change from the usual toilets are very sleek and very clean and so big i cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting gucci post dinner did not work for me but one can always try\",\"came here on a pretty amazing random whim with a great gentleman his crew while visiting singapore my goodness the presentation flavor of the drinks food were amazing and orgasmic how they made carrots mac cheese mini kobe burgers fish tacos potatoes all separate dishes taste like culinary heaven is beyond me the bartender and servers were courteous lively which definitely amped up the atmosphere i thoroughly enjoyed myself\",\"this has got to be the best steak house i have ever experienced i am formerly of new york city and had my fair share of solid steaks i have even frequented cut restaurants in other locations including los angeles and dubai but for some reason the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best cut but also one of the best restaurants in singapore what also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection their cocktails definitely among the best in singapore fresh ingredients and creative mixology similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff the only ones i have found in sg so far that can even compare to the creations here are bar stories on arab st and nutmeg and clove on club st you can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy my favorite is duke of earl a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin also love their spiked thai iced tea anyways for the food their kobe beef is unreal frankly you cannot go wrong with any of their steaks lastly their dessert they also have the best dessert i have ever had in my life highly recommend their baked alaska which has kaya ice cream inside unreal make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons drinks steaks dessert every person i have brought here ends up loving it as much as i do and for good cause you wo not be disappointed\",\"event planners beware i am an event planner and had a very disappointing experience i gave  stars because the food and service was good the management team organizing was not i felt they were dishonest with the amount of wine my group consumed which we have no choice but to pay because i was not onsite to confirm i was also charged a higher amount on wine as they did not have the type i chose of which i am still awaiting a refund from early march the communication has been slow and not genuine my concerns were expressed multiple times and still have not heard from a manager\",\"i took my husband here for his birthday while in singapore and this is hands down one of the best restaurants we have been to the server was a so was dinner my favorite was my mocktail apple cucumber basil what a great experience needless to say he enjoyed his birthday\",\"best steaks in town the kobe steak is just amazing i had the filet mignon the pork belly starter was also really good\",\"this is probably the best steak house in singapore we ordered the wagu grade  steak it literally melt in our mouths we started with the tuna tartar excellentthen we had the steak that was shared heaven wine was ok on the expensive side they wo not allowed us to bring our own a bit of a downer we finished with sweet port n chocolate souffl a highly recommended place if u are willing to spend at least  per person\",\"i took myself on valentine is day after working a long day for starters the bread was delish i preferred the pretzel bun with the soft butter i ordered a nice glass of red wine with help from their sommelier i also got the ribeye and the potatoes the ribeye was cooked perfectly medium rare and it was a nice cut those potatoes were fabulous roasted smashed then crisped and garnished with lots of savory onions for dessert i splurged and got the chocolate souffl oh my goodness this is literally in my top  desserts ever it was just pure delight and not too chocolatey when the souffl arrived the waiter topped it with melted chocolate a dollop of whip cream and then topped it with more chocolate gah i also got a glass of sweet red wine which was a nice accompaniment to the souffl i am drooling now as i think of that delicious meal enjoy oh and i almost forgot they gave me a long stem red rose and a box of homemade chocolates they were fabulous i did not see them give them to the guys at the table next to me so thanks for making my day\",\"dined here a few weeks ago crab cakes butter lettuce filet with the apple crumble dessert enjoyed it very much filet was excellently prepared would definitely return here next time\",\"i really do not have much negatives to say about this place despite it being twice as more expensive than the la version which usually annoys me from what i recall they had some kind of discounts if you make it before the happy hour ends we came here for our anniversary dinner few months back and the service atmosphere and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration i am a bone marrow fan and it did not disappoint unlike the one in osteria mozza across the street though i am also a long time fan of that restaurant it was juicy flavorful and exactly messy and authentic as the ones i would eat in new york d usually gets the rib eye and i get the filet mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish and both were on point on the side caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair overall a place to go in singapore when you are missing some good quality meat in your life\",\"the exterior of the restaurant was intimidating but thankfully i had the courage to walk in and order a drink at the bar because it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life sorry for the exaggeration the bar menu was reasonable in price not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu and they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn and when they say gourmet they mean gourmet their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with parmesan cheese i am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich sounding cocktail concoctions the super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and i ended up with a drink called dying love i may be mistaken but sounds like it the drink was visually gorgeous a raspberry resting on a slab of ice floating on a pink sea similar to the movies titanic and life of pi from the bar menu i ordered the mini steak burgers  small ones on a cute white plate while they are small trust me they are enough to fill you up as an added bonus they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu so it is a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending  dollars all in all cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants i have been to i have yet to try their fine dining area but from my initial experience at the bar i am sure i wo not be disappointed when that time comes\",\"cut is on the playing field with the top tier of steakhouses in the world offering top cuts of beef imported from the leading beef nations including waygu beef from japan the menu and the atmosphere were certainly more of what i would expect in a west coast or las vegas steakhouse no surprise contemporary minimalist furnishing and decor small plates with a modern cuisine flair like shrimp cocktail with a wasabi panna cotta and delicate yuzu sauce the us angus filet i had was absolutely spot on and delicious the wine list had a pretty good range in the by the glass selection and the bar had a good variety of cocktails classic and innovative both stylistically i prefer the old school new york chicago style steakhouses this i would not categorize as traditional american restaurants where the emphasis is on the excellence of the ingredients and mastery of basic dishes that compliment the centerpiece of the meal so while i enjoyed my experience the match goes to other team particularly when one considers that this player has a bigger paycheck than who it is up against\",\"do not get me wrong this is a great restaurant but i would never recommend it to anyone as it is massively over priced the food is excellent and the service quite good i had the pork belly as a starter and it was melt in the mouth perfection my husband and i shared the porterhouse which was delicious and perfectly cooked the onion rings are excellent as well exactly the way you always hope they will be but rarely are i had the s mores for dessert and loved them the wine menu is seriously extensive as is the cocktail menu i loved the music but not sure that the ramones would be to every diner is liking but  for dinner for two at a steak house is far too much in my opinion the mark up on wine is huge i just cannot justify the cost\",\"amazing food court but beware if you are not used to asian food and are being experimental touring singapore this may not be the place for you try something like lau pasat instead\",\"five star food centre the hardest decision starving myself so i can pack all the delicious offerings and still lament over what else i want to eat disclaimer no air conditioning noisy crowded and expect long lines or queues if you can put aside these dining conditions old airport road is amazing it is a must eat stop for me in sg top of my list seafood soup with minced pork balls yan ji seafood soup this cloudy soup is slowed cooked with layers of flavor there is hint of wokhei fried flat fish ground and added to the minced pork elevates the flavor it is salty and i do not like cooked seafood usually but i cannot got enough of this broth i dream about this soup in the usa i usually get the soup with just the meatballs but everyone else gets fish i hear the prawns are cooked perfectly firm succulent and sweet hint the cheap standard fish they offer is good enough do not be put off the price it is worth it

still peckish try the epok epok or curry puff with egg char kuay teow or rice noodles with black soy and cockles plump oysters in a half shell s  per oyster\",\"i was excited to visit old airport road hawker center specifically for lor mee from the uber popular stall xin mei xiang zheng zong after watching a segment on youtube i braved the long queue and waited over an hour to partake in what i expected to be a bowl of yumminess unfortunately it was a huge disappointment lor mee served with noodles and a generous topping of fish and other ingredients the gravy was significantly rich and thick with a slightly gelatinous texture and predominantly tasted of fish it is definitely an acquired taste not something i would get again despite the rave reviews of lor mee the unsung hero is the minced mixed noodle imo pork dumplings and minced pork swimming in a bowl of wide rice noodles the broth was light and full of flavors with the fresh herbs adding brightness to this delicious dish a must try char kway teow noodles and proteins were impeccably cooked with a beautifully smoky charred flavor however it was well under seasoned and one noted perhaps a dash of soy sauce will help lift the flavors a bit or it was an off day for the stall overall it was not a bad dish fried prawn and pork rolls were a mixed of sweet and savory flavors while it was not my favorite it was a nice side dish curry chicken and black pepper pork puffs had a flaky crispy crusts and loaded with herbs and spices a great snack especially on the go a great tourist destination for food sweets and beverages on the cheap\",\"ok maybe i was waiting to be blown away after it was talked up so much but it was just ok good we had some noodles and a clay chicken pot with rice clay pot dish seemed a little dry and over cooked to me maybe we went too late but and it was the bottom of the barrel it did take  min to prepare so it was not just thrown together anyway pretty good and no complaints but i do not think i would make the trek to a hawker market again i would eat passing by experience box checked\",\"lots of goodies but goodieslor mie nyonya chendol salt sous vide style hawker stall\",\"the hawker food options are limitless here there are so many hawker stalls to choose from and they all look so good i cannot pinpoint any single one but i bet you wo not be disappointed with any of these mom and pop shops it is a little ways out of the main downtown area but can easily be accessed via public transportation\",\"old airport road known as the most popular hawker in singapore offers a wide selection of food across different price points depending on what you eat i love eating here but it also makes my indecisiveness a problem haha some of the stalls will sell out and close early to make sure you get to try everything go in a group and go for lunch instead of dinner i have had a few times where i wanted to get roast meats there but they sell out before dinner\",\"loved this hawker center tried so many different types of food for so cheap hua kee hougang famous wonton noodles   was definitely a favorite here they nailed the wonton noodle dish the perfect amount of chili sauce dried shrimp and meat to sauce to noodle ratio we also tried hock guan is rojak   which was delicious i only had this once while in singapore so i cannot compare it to other places we ordered some pork satay from chuan kee satay   the flavor was amazing and the pork was tender but it was definitely on the oily side whampoa soya bean is   bean curd with red bean was sensational i wish i buy an entire tub of this and eat it everyday\",\"selera rasa if you have not heard of the now   briyani you are missing out used to get this back in my ns days when it was like  and was super stoked to find out the hawker was still around  years later the macik is the best she is super nice and used to remember our faces when we came over for lunch that being said i only remember her being opened till the mid afternoon never saw the place open for dinner but i digress this is hands down one of the best briyanis on the island the rice is fragrant and goes super well with the curry they used the fried chicken and it is little fried scraps are tasty and fresh be sure to ask for veg and the papadum as well she was out of veg when i got there at pm nevertheless always worth the visit selera rasa is located in the corner of old airport road food center the corner being the side closer to the hdb blocks as opposed to the cross street\",\"if you come to this food court get the prawn mee at albert street prawn noodle the line can get outrageously long so maybe try getting here before the rush seriously though the prawn mee is amazingly delicious a really unique and complex mix of flavors in one broth also get the or chein oyster omelette at xing li cooked food and if you have a sweet tooth and want something to cool down with away from the heat and humidity nyona chendol is good i like the original but adding red beans looks just as good everything here is cheap relatively speaking old airport road is popular and a bit more touristy but also a little further away from town so if you are a visitor you should just call a taxi mrt is always good but not everyone has the time or patience to check routes and stops if you are a tourist with little to no exposure to singaporean and malaysian food most of the food here will probably seem to be delicious to you more often than not if there is a long line for one particular hawker the food is good but seriously no trip singapore would be complete without visiting a good ole food court\",\"as i was doing my research on which hawkers are the best and that i must visit old airport road was one of the highest rated one as you get off the metro station do not get the first food court area confused with the hawker which is right after however the food center opens earlier than the hawker the hawker location had great food selection although this hawker was not my favorite just based on overall atmosphere\",\"roast paradise  charsiew with chicken rice  starsnot much meat and the meat has a layer of fat in each slice and is a bit too burnt on the edges which i do not quite like but overall the meat is cooked really well moist juicy meat not too sweet or salty bnr coffeekopi c kosong bing  starsrich good flavor even without sugar would get less ice the next time park at the multistorey carpark the lanes are nice and wide compared to most other hdb carparks\",\"praise the lord for hawker centers with so many hawker centers in singapore it is hard to decide which one in my favourite old airport road food centre is definitely a stand out it is highly accessible via multiple bus line with endless options such as prawn noodle wonton noodles fish balls fresh juice curry puffs rojak kopi and kaya toast available this center is where food dreams are form be sure to visit old airport road food centre to eat till your heart is content\",\"this is one of the many hawker centers in singapore and compared to some of the other big ones this one is much less touristy our friend who lives in singapore suggested that we meet here for lunch and it was a fantastic adventure we employed the long queue method for determining which stalls to purchase from for a feast of  dishes and  drinks we spent about  total the best item we got by far was the bbq meat i am not sure which stall it was but this one is absolutely worth seeking out happy eating\",\"wow i had such an amazing experience here while i was visiting singapore i loved the fresh juices and smoothies along with the chicken rice if you are in singapore you need to check this place out because you wo not be disappointed there are so many different options for food and you will find something tasty for everyone\",\"must get the sugar cane juice  very refreshing and affordable drink one of the stall the uncle and aunties will come to your table and ask if you want something to drink they will take your order and then bring it to you that is when you pay them the money we tried to try a lot of the stalls and almost everything that we got is very good we got some recommendation on youtube channels my favorite was the laska p s bring your own napkins\",\"my dad and i came here for lunch during our last day in singapore we went to eat at maxwell hawker food centre twice already and decided to come here instead to get here you will need to take the mrt to dakota stop and it is along the circle yellow line this place is pretty huge the first floor are the hawker stalls and the nd floor are mainly shops selling goods stalls that we tried roast paradise stall   they offer roasted pig and char siew dishes our meals costed  sgd each hong hua dessert stall   they offer a variety of shaved iced desserts we shared the ice kachang and it costed   sgd we also got the sugar cane drink but i do not recall what stall it was not bad overall i wanted to try chau kee satay stall   but they only open in the evenings i also wanted to try lao ban soya beancurd stall   again but i was already too full to eat anymore note i tried their tofu dessert at maxwell tho i will come visit again whenever i am in singapore\",\"lots of stalls here and plenty of seats i like the dry noodles stall that is on the outside corner of the center and also the fried bananas were yummy here definitely would visit again when in singapore\",\"classic hawker center known by locals to be one of sg is best they serve a huge variety of food here with many good selections quite packed and a bit difficult to find seat for a large group but nonetheless a good place to visit to immerse in the true local experiencereviews of some popular stalls i have been to per the below dong ji fried kuay teow the stir fried noodle here has a nice wok smell but the line is long and moves slowly so gotta be patient lao fu zi fried kuay teow another fried kuay teow stall this one has a stronger walk smell than dong ji but i personally prefer dong ji is seasoning of the noodle a very good option nonetheless but super long slow line since they cook one dish at a time wen wen prawn mee average nothing particularly special roast paradise really good bbq pork recommend nam sing hokkien mee usually i am not a big fan of hokkien mee but this one is good the noodle is not too soggy from the gravy and there is a hint of wok smell in the sauce long line chuan kee satay ok despite its popularity i have had better satay elsewhere toa payoh rojak personally not a rojak fan but this is one of the better ones i have had the ingredients were fresh and well balanced if you order with chili it can indeed get spicy hua kee wanton meat good comforting wonton noodles not mindblowing but a safe good bet  soya bean a good place for traditional sg chinese dessert try the tao huey cold tofu pudding sugar cane juice a classic sg refreshment for a hot day\",\"i loved the hawker center here my cousin and her fiancee took us here as this was their favorite you can find a seat first and then go to all of the different stands let them know how many ppl are eating they price the portions so you do not have to pay for more than you can eat they bring the food straight to your table number when it is ready even when you pay for beer they bring the bottles to your table too absolutely great food and experience\",\"another cheap michelin star restaurant selling the famous bak kut teh which means pork ribs tea it is just white pepper broth with a hint of vinegar even though they claim it has none they have  locations throughout sg and all are make the same broth after a few spoonfuls it gets very addicting the pork melts in your mouth and the servers come around refilling the broth for free also ordered ngoh hiang like a soft bean curd minced pork roll and was delicious too cheap food i believe it was usd for  items for sure will be back\",\"i was not convinced that this place warranted the reviews when i saw a couple patsy white ribs in some clear ish broth how could anything be delicious when it looked boiled with no seasonings nope nope nope i stand corrected i can admit i was very wrong the meat was unlike any other ribs i have ever had and the broth is just an extra bonus how something so unassuming and simple can be so good i can not pretend to even know but my socks were completely knocked off can soup make a grown woman cry yes yes it can the ambiance and service is simple the price is low and the product is amazing will i fly back to singapore for ribs in soup i just might\",\"i walked across the streets nearly swam over the oceans to arrive here just kidding it was pouring so hard outside even though i brought my umbrella with me my shoes and socks were soaking wet we ordered the pork ribs soup  homemade ngoh hiang and oolong tea pork ribs soup was amazing the flavour was still dancing in my tastebuds even after i had swallowed my spoonful of soup waitress walking around with a pot of soup to refill for the customers i had three refills already the pork ribs were soooo tender homemade ngoh hiang tasted crispy on the outside and the inside was stuffed with pork meat one had to dip the pork ribs in sweet and sour sauce to enrich the taste last but not the least i was given a pot and a bag of tea leaves to make my own oolong tea it was such a good experience there are still a lot of dishes i wanted to try but i am already full hope that they will open a restaurant in canada\",\"tender pork that falls off the bone a rich pepper essence soup broth that warms the soul couple these two goats together and you have a recipe for the ages i do not even think it is necessary to add more detail here because the goat needs no introduction no explanation no approval the pork rib pepper soup here at song fa bak kut teh really is the goat tiger woods michael jordan of soups all hail and long live the goat in song fa bak kut teh we trust\",\"bak kut teh is a garlicky peppery flavorful pork soup that is a must try when in singapore it is delicious mixed with rice there are so many bak kut teh restaurants in singapore but song fa was so good that we came back a second time during our short  days trip we even got bak kut teh spice packets so we can make it at home we tried making it and it is pretty similar to the real thing when you follow their directions correctly and the soup has essentially unlimited refills they come around asking you if you want more soup and we refilled our bowl  times their tea is very strong and aromatic and also available to buy in packets to brew at home\",\"i was in singapore on a food hunting trip and i could not pass on some bak kut teh it is one of my favourite things to eat i arrived at a fairly late hour after pm i have heard there is typically a lineup but being a solo diner at less than peak hours i got seated right away the place looks clean and bright and people around me seem to be having a great time the service as i recall was really good i ordered the staple prime spare ribs soup which comes with a bowl of rice a plate of gai lan and the server suggested lemon barley water which is made in house the total bill came out to be around  sgd the main event was amazing i loved the white pepper flavour of the broth and it warmed me up to my tippy toes good thing they have ac i did expect a bit more pork flavour but it was really good nonetheless by the way did i mention the broth is bottomless the server came by at least   times to ask if i wanted a refill it was so good it was hard to refuse but at the end i was just too stuffed to have anymore the lemon barley tea was fantastic also and hit the spot to alternate between the hot broth and the cold drink the gai lan was on point and very generous for the  sgd price tag overall i had a very satisfying time and i would definitely go back again given the chance to try more things hopefully next time i can go with more people to try more things on the menu\",\"one of my favorite meals in singapore out in la even though we have all types of food available it is always hard to find a place that serves bkt  and of its on the menu it is not as good as this place such a simple dish of broth and pork ribs with rice also had the pork kidney and stomach soup as well both just as good broth is more peppery for the stomach soup in case those who are allergic or do not like pepper the kidney does have a little blood when it comes out not over cooking if you are skirmish on the red might want to pass side veggies were decent more to add green in the table not a must they will refill your soup so get a big bowl of rice going they have a good drinks menu but opted for the kung fu tea the royal garden is the one they sell you do have to make and prepare it yourself at the table that is real tea service after the meal you can also grab a couple boxes to make at home which i did but will update my results on how it turns out they have multiple locations but this one is located inside a shopping center near chinatown i visited one other location closer to marina bay and downtown but does not have ac this type of humidity and heat not the best place to be consuming broth\",\"not sure why i ended up in chinatown but there i was and i was absolutely starving song fa to the rescue had to wait a bit for the table but was able to put the order in before seating to quicken the turn works for me the pork rib soup here never disappoints the flavor and heat on the broth was so good that i refilled probably  times or so yes there is unlimited refill the fish soup was loaded to the top with plenty of fish and also had the same soup base as the pork i was initially a bit thrown off because i was honestly expecting a fish based broth it still worked since i like the pork broth anyway but i will probably just stick with the pork rib soup next time bean curd was surprising good i will probably get that again have been very tempted to pick up some of the soup base that they sell not sure how much it will resemble the in store version if i am the one cooking it\",\"came by when we were in chinatown there was a line but our wait was only about  minutes staff will take your order while in line to speed up food delivery once you do get a table ordered their signature pork ribs soup braised pork belly braised fried beancurd ngoh hiang and assorted vegetables broth for the soup appeared very simple but had such a nice taste and they refill the broth for free pork belly and ngoh hiang kind of sausage were very tasty some in our group thought the pork belly had too much fat service was good and they give you a moist towelette\",\"solid   for song fa bkt bak kut teh is an aromatic pork rib pepper soup that is so good i would not mind eating in the hot muggy hawker centers of singapore if i recall correctly this location of song fa has air con but do not hold me to that when you order the soup they will come around and refill your broth as many times as you need the meat is tender and delicious you can also purchase soup packets to make your own bkt at home there will likely be a wait but the line moves pretty quickly and you can always pop by the mc donalds if you need a snack\",\"highly recommend the loin rib soup even though the weather was hot and humid we came here after a long walk from marina bay and gardens by the bay at night the place was packed but did not have to wait for a table quick tip get the small as there is unlimited refill of soup unless you want an extra rib we did not even start eating yet and they already started coming by to refill your soup they rec to move the rib to the empty bowl so you can fill up with more soup\",\"despite not being hungry since we had eaten at  other places already that morning we found ourselves wanting to try song fa bkt before heading to the airport and leaving singapore this location was the closest to us and we arrived around pm not realizing that there would be a wait luckily the wait was only around  minutes and the food came out quickly everyone was having some version of the famous fall of the bone rib soup it was hearty and delicious the clear soup was flavorful from the hours of cooking that said i think the rib soup i make at home is almost at good and i am no genius in the kitchen\",\"this little restaurant is usually filled to the brim with people but today we had a little space to enjoy our lunch come early and be ready to sit wherever you can find a spot the soup and pork ribs are amazing here they come out with little tea kettles with the soup so that you can have more with your meal if you like the soup you can even buy packets to make it at home with the seasonings they provide the pork itself is soft and extremely flavorful from the seasoning it is not your traditional ribs you would see in other restaurants that are filled with sauce or other flavorings it is a light flavor that enhances the flavor of the pork itself you can almost say it melts in your mouth and definitely falls off the bone they also serve a variety of food like pork belly feet liver and veggies all items were delicious i would go back without any question\",\"we were in singapore for  days and passed by this restaurant a dozen time boy do we regret it we came here after we had dinner elsewhere so our bellies were quite content we came in for the famous pork soup and paired it with a bowl of rice and vegetables the flavor notes of the soup is incredibly rich and intense we were both shell shocked we also arrived right before closing which the restaurant happily accommodated they even gave us additional servings of soup for free not sure if this is a free gesture anyway whether you are looking for a place to eat a full meal or a snack this is a must try\",\"can get the server to understand had to point he still did not get it right ordered large pork soup supposed to get  bones i got  skinny bones and a stub hidden under server said that was  bones i blew my top and walked out\",\"we had a  hour layover in singapore and we were hunting for the best places to eat this happened to definitely take top  we stopped by looking for some soup the line was long but it moved pretty fast our party of  got seated within  minutes around lunch time on a week day we stayed simple and ordered the large rib soup with rice and a side of veggies as simple as the rib soup was it was delicious it was so flavorful yet so simple my husband and i both found so much joy in slurping our soup the soup comes with unlimited refills but the meat does not we got about  refills of soup haha this place also feels very homey and i felt that they used quality ingredients because you could taste the flavor of the ribs really well and they were incredibly tender\",\"i absolutely love this place for bak kuh teh pork ribs soup the soup is flavorful and delicious the meat is quite good and you also can ask for unlimited refills of soup i also would definitely recommend ordering the  to dip in the soup they taste amazing together i also personally prefer the prime spare rib soup over the standard pork ribs soup i find the texture to be better and the meat is much easier to eat as well note that there can be a wait at times i have been here a couple times for weekday dinners and usually have to wait about   minutes there are actually  queues as well one outside and one inside the outside one tends to be shorter but has no a c so take your pick the prices here are also quite reasonable the standard pork rips soup is s   for regular or s   for the large you only get more meat with the large and i think the soup is the best part so i would go for the regular the prime spare rib soup is s\",\"having traveled   km and the memories from song fa bak kut teh are still with me the aroma and the flavor from the pork rib soup are very distinct as the garlic smacks your taste buds at first i was quite taken aback then i tried it again the flavor was just as intense and rich that you can only sip a little bit at a time as i try the other dish pork belly and pork loin which just melts in your mouth it was pure deliciousness however you always find yourself coming back to the pork rib soup the best part is when you are almost done with the pork soup they come and pour some more that is just magical this restaurant is a must for anybody visiting\",\"bak kut teh translates from hokkien to mean pork rib tea it is actually pork ribs soup served with a variety of side dishes the accompanying tea you can brew on your own song fa is one of the famous local places i have grown up eating tender meat comes with free flowing soup that has just the right amount of kick from the peppercorns the kidney and liver were also done just right\",\"this is the place to go for bak kut teh according to my singaporean friend i can see why the soup base is a symphony of garlic and pepper a loud symphony like tchaikovsky is  overture but a masterpiece nevertheless i tried bak kut te elsewhere since but it just is not the same we arrived at the restaurant before opening and there was already a line\",\"closest you will find in singapore to good authentic japanese ramen broth is amazing and seriously worth the price\",\"third time a charmi have dined at ippudo first in new york and second in hong kong singapore is my favorite like any good restaurant in sg there is wait line for a table early before opening or later after   p m there is a lesser wait time the hakata ramen and well seasoned pork broth is savory perfection the interior is smartly decorated with a dominate crystal chandelier as its center piece service is quick and disciplined to a perfection waitstaff are incredibly efficient in turning tables located mandarin gallery closest mrt station somerset ns\",\"came here on a recommendation ramen was outstanding but the real players were the pork buns and the steak very freaking delicious the french fries tastes american which i was hoping for murica\",\"famous for its ramen have not been here for a long time no queue at   p m on a saturday but it was full by about  p m shiromaru specialippudo is original creamy tonkotsu broth served with thin and straight noodles pork belly pork loin bean sprout black fungus and spring onion a classic hakata style ramen selection of noodles soft medium hard or very hard love the ramen but am not so sure about the char siew or the  layered pork which i did not find to be tender goma kyuri crunchy japanese cucumber with home made sesame dressing refreshing renkon chips crispy tasty lotus root chips nice crispy beef tataki well marbled prime beef slices pan seared and served with tangy soy sauce good lemon soda a non alcoholic cocktail made with fresh lemons and mint leaves refreshing\",\"loveddd the ramen here came on a wednesday afternoon and there was no wait you cannot go wrong with the original broth and medium for noodle hardness the pork was tender and flavorful and the umami egg was cooked perfectly this is comfort food for sure really enjoyed our meal\",\"while it is not the most impressive but it carried the title of being an authentic japan noodle this is my nd visit despite it is a busy day of its rd anniversary celebration it offered real cheap pricing of   for per bowl of ramen it did not cut cost or scrimp and save its ingredient it is still the world renowned ippudo standard hence i round it up to a  star even though it is a\",\"quick stop over in s pore and always love this place great service and food is excellent i prefer to get the standard ramen with extra noodles always hits the spot before i crash and try to get some sleep there are several other ramen shops in the plaza so make sure you go to right spot on the th floor\",\"quite disappointing to be honest while the noodles are ok the broth seems to lack the flavour of some other ramen places a lot more expensive than standard ramen joints i am not sure what the price premium is for\",\"checked this place out on a business trip to singapore it was located in the mall right across the street from my hotel i tend to want to check out ramen places and pho places no matter what city i am in just to benchmark i am glad i did here good savory broth noodles cooked perfectly zero complaints on that front i did not know what to expect reading it was hakata style but was pleasantly surprised especially knowing i was trying ramen out in a mall which in the us is usually a recipe for a blech kind of ramen experience paired our ramen with gyoza which was perfectly seared and fried as i so often do i benchmark against santa ramen and ramen dojo here in the bay area this place is not as good as those but it is a place i would most definitely come back to the next time i come back to singapore do not let the fact that it is in a mall predispose you against giving it a try it wo not knock your socks off with a two by four but it is good decent ramen\",\"omg the food here is delicious you get to customize how thick you want your noodles and how spicy you want it to be all in all the akamura special and karaage was good\",\"i lived in japan for quite some time and i have traveled around the world a bit so for me it is quite hard to eat something not entirely local in a different country from where the food was invented i love ramen so going at ippudo was a bit of a challenge under certain points of view but being in singapore i take less risks than eating ramen in europe for example anyhow ippudo ramen is very close to the real deal tonkotsu soup is rich and tasty ramen are perfectly made no complaints there only note of demerit is the fake japanese atmosphere where everyone shouts in japanese welcome phrases but know no real japanese language apart from those lines then again it is all part of the atmosphere so it does not really matter in the end\",\"truth be told the ramen is nice hardness of ramen good not too hard nor mushy char siew is soft and tender soup broth is thick and tasty so would i go back again not quite sure i mean i had nothing going wrong with the meal there was no queue going in service was good food arrived swiftly food is tasty bill was settled quickly so what is wrong with me i supposed it is the up market feel that maketh my lunch to be more expensive that i was willing to pay for\",\"i love that they serve luke warm water instead of cold water because no one wants to eat hot noodles and drink cold water at the same time your teeth will get destroyed anyway great food and great staff must try the pork buns get them at pcs at a cheaper price\",\"so came to singapore wanted to see if they could make good ramen ippudo in japan is pretty big and well known so i thought what the heck well the broth is substandard here and way too salty with no real fat to coat the tongue the noodles were basic also the special egg they used was pretty unimpressive also and the chasu is hard and not well flavored i have eaten better ramen pretty much everywhere it does not compare to the ramen in japan at all or even the us has way better ramen just sad go elsewhere plus the price is ridiculous for suck subpar food total disappointment\",\"one of the best ramen the ambiance is very good i will definitely come back for more\",\"service staff was quite short with us emphasizing their need to get everyone out over the customer is experience despite the place listing an pm closing time they stop taking side dish orders at pm and ramen at pm the ramen was only average despite the  price tag this was my second time here and unimpressed with the food service and pricing i will not be returning\",\"i used to live in tokyo and visit ippudo at least once a week for their amazing lunch special for  yen you got ramen gyouza unlimited rice and tea there were also yummy spicy moyashi bean sprouts on the table i loved ippudo in tokyo no lines good food homey atmosphere then i went to ippudo ny a terrible experience that has destroyed my taste for any ramen so then here i was at ippudo singapore the line was not too bad and we got seated relatively quickly i got my usual akamaru ramen and gyouza the gyouza was not as good as in japan the akamaru ramen was perfect but alas ippudo manhattan has permanently scarred me for ramen i cannot eat it anymore without feeling really sick lessons do not go to ippudo ny ever do go to ippudo in japan and singapore enjoy the best ramen in the world since i cannot anymore best dish akamaru ramen\",\"i like that ippudo always has a seasonal menu serving up special seasonable ramen my standard order though is the spicy tonkotsu ramen with egg tonkotsu broth with spicy miso which adds a kick to the otherwise very thick soup noodle portions are pretty small but you can order an extra serving of noodles the line is very long so definitely go early to avoid the wait\",\"we stumbled here after striking out at a few other of these multi story mall type places and we should have just started here we started off with the piping hot melty cheese over rice and wow it was so good finished our meal splitting ramen that was tasty had good spice and they brought us a couple bowls to make splitting easier great service even though we showed up not too long before closing time and a great meal\",\"yum this is the best ramen i had during my stay in singapore i have eaten ramen in japan and this was pretty close the opportunity to customize your meal is great the broth was delicious and so were the cucumbers and the gyoza\",\"was craving dosa and only about a  minutes walk from the hotel not many places open early in the morning in little india ordered the pongal upma mysore dosa uttipam and mango shake they did not have any lassis in the morning very delicious and made to order was the only caucasian within miles and loved it for sure will be back when in the singaporean little india area\",\"finding a friendly and fast south indian tamil restaurant in singapore should not be that surprising i think so yes i was not surprised by anything at komala vilas and apparently it is a pretty old restaurant which used to be good i am glad to tell you they are holding up pretty well the food was overall pretty good we tried everything from the spicy podi dosa to the soft idlies and to the foot tall cone dosa which was unsurprisingly shaped like a cone they all tasted pretty darn good and consistent the chutneys could have had a little bit of variation they all tasted pretty much the same which kind of got old pretty fast the best part about the meal was the glorious filter coffee it was bitter just so darn bitter and sweet exactly how south indian coffee should be it was a perfect way to wrap this breakfast up will drop by again when i am craving some nostalgia\",\"komala vilas is a nice indian vegetarian restaurant in little india that satisfied our hunger around lunch time space can be a little cramped since it was busy and we ended up scaring our table with another patron the food was delicious i am normally a guy who needs meat in his meals but the wife was craving vegetarian i ordered garlic naan with mushroom mutton and she got the onion uttapam with three sides the garlic naan has visible bits of garlic covering it but surprisingly not overpowering with flavor i would not have minded a stronger punch of garlic but i do love garlic the mushroom mutton was also very tasty and not overpowering as far as flavors go i probably could have ordered another set of naan bread to finish the mutton with the uttapam was a pancake like food which we ordered the onion version of it is like much thicker dosai with a topping of your choice the sides were really good and my wife especially liked the curry one i personally liked the spicy one the white one reminded me of a cole slaw we finished the meal with a mango lassi which was refreshing not overpowering with the yogurt flavor which i appreciated you can tell a lot of locals cane here to eat which was a great sign thankfully they also had a sink with soap to wash your hands since the meals are eaten by hand overall really good experience and we would come back again\",\"i asked an indian friend of mine for a recommendation where to eat in little india she told me to go to komala and so i did i felt a little foreign but the staff helped me to the best available to understand the many menu items do not ask me the three items i ordered all i know is that one was mushroom but they were really good and i enjoyed the many different flavors\",\"komala vilas located in little india in singapore serves authentic flavourful indian food it is a vegetarian restaurant that serves amazing curries as well as classic indian breads a must try is the thosais which are massive long thin crunchy crepes that can be filled with a lot of things such as potatoes masala thosai or onions another must try is their vadai which are the donuts that are fried to perfection their poori is so light and fluffy and definitely worth trying all their breads thosais vadai etc pair excellently with the curries that they are served with they even have traditional indian desserts like gulab jamun their mango lassi is also very thick and has a lot of delicious mango flavour the restaurant is split into two floors with the upper floor being for rice dishes and the bottom floor being for breads and thosais this place is a definite must try\",\"awesome south indian vegetarian food great prices too highlights were butter masala paneeraloo gobimasala dosagarlic naan\",\"i looked up restaurants in little india on yelp and was not disappointed it is completely vegetarian so i was a bit surprised that there are no chicken or lamb dishes on the menu i ordered the vegetable meatballs in a masala sauce very tasty had it with garlic naan and a mango lassi my husband had the chappati meal which consists of different kinds of curries and sauces each one was nice but not noteworthy we enjoyed our meal but could have used something a bit more substantial i love plant based foods but it is nice to have meat curries as an option too for me personally i enjoyed my meal but just was not in love with it\",\"every indian person i know from singapore could not stop telling me how amazing this place was so on a jet lagged morning i strolled in to taste the masala dosa and idli the masala dosa was no good no taste and the sambhar lacked your expected south indian punch the idli was good but i mean it is idli two points for the chutney if you want to eat better south indian breakfast hold on to your gut and try anadha bhavan or sarvana bhavan if you are upset with this opinion i understand i am spoiled by years of tasteful masala dosa and idli this spot just did not do it for me\",\"this little indian cafe has garnered quite a name for itself within the little india area in singapore and when my friends and i were wandering around the area decided to give it a try since we were craving indian food i got the masala dosa   which is a crepe like bread filled with potatoes and onions and three dipping sauces on the side one appeared to be yogurt based another with chili peppers in it and then another that was similar to curry the food itself was barebones delicious and even at around pm the restaurant was packed there were side boxes for to go samosas that also looked delicious the menu is hard to understand if you are not familiar with authentic indian cuisine but everything is so good and the pictures provide a lot we were in and out quickly even though we ended up sitting down and is a good place to take a quick meal snack break while wandering around little india however bathroom is fairly hard to get to so keep that in mind when visiting and they often squeeze people very close to each other in the dining space otherwise a great authentic and local place to get indian food in the area additionally the restaurant is completely vegetarian so take note meat lovers\",\"visited this tiny hole in the wall outpost a few weeks ago during my singapore trip chose to sat downstairs where you get the choice of alacarte menu the feast served on a banana leaf was not only scrumptious but brimming with good taste the only problem i felt was the way to the restroom was through their kitchen and not at all clean as per singapore is standard perhaps use the restrooms in the mall close by and come here to enjoy good food\",\"dosai meal     starsvegetables left to right long beans potato bananasauces left to right green chili and coconut red chili and onion daal tamarind sauce cardamom dessertmasala dosai stuffed with a potato currythis was absolutely massive it would last me   meals at least thank goodness i did not order the paneer butter masala could definitely share this dish the first two sauces on the left always come with dosai according to the manager owner and the tamarind sauce usually goes with rice everything tasted good i suppose i did not give it  stars because i was a bit tired of the dish   of the way through masala tea     starsloved this spicy and not sweet there is sugar on the table for you to add ambience  starsdown to earth homey and clean you share a table if you are alone in a group of two which was nice i ended up chatting with a young sri lankan couple who knew more about indian food than me i will have to come back to try the paneer butter masala and the spinach dish\",\"went there for lunch after a long day of exploring singapore so we were really hungry tried the palak paneer aloo gobi masala and plane dosai overall we liked the food a lot the palak paneer was my favorite also got the naan butter and garlic i thought the butter naan was better i was not the biggest fan of the sauces with the dosai we also tried the samosas the crust was a bit too thick and not very flaky the service was good even though they had a lot of customers food  service and atmosphere  price  overall\",\"opens at am so good for breakfast if you do not have something at a hotel ok for inexpensive breakfast had the poori set which is  poori and  dal filter coffee was ok fine in this area where a lot of places are not open early\",\"ever since i found komala on yelp i was craving for indian food i could not wait to try their food i do not have much knowledge comes to indian food but i know it was a good meal under s  even tho it was all vegetarian it left me content the drinks are rather expensive compared to the prices for the food i was very very happy until i saw the sign says c hidden under the cashier counter lol fortunately i did not get a stomache but i really do not wanna think about what goes on in their kitchen\",\"a entire restaurant full of vegetarian options is usually an easy win for me and this place definitely delivered the food was really good and the staff here were really friendly the prices are very affordable and the portions are large the food does look deceptively small on the menu photos so i ended up ordered way more food than i needed but was very happy i got to try a little bit of everything\",\"the first time i ever went to singapore over twenty years ago i got there very late at night and after spending the night at my hotel near orchard road got up early the next morning and took a taxi to komala vilas on serangoon road this was the first of many many visits with the most recent one being in late  i sat downstairs and ordered idlis a medhu vada and upma and then totally relished my wonderful breakfast for those who do not know what an idling is the answer is that it is a white colored soft discus shaped slightly sour cake generally  to  inches in diameter and made with fermented batter like masa for tamales using a mix of soaked rice and daal lentils medu vadas are savory fried donuts made from the same flour upuma is a savory version of cream of wheat cooked in ghee and with bits of fried curry leaves onions mustard and fenugreek seeds with bits of dried and green chilies plus chopped green coriander leaves by lunch time i was craving the food at komala vilas again and upon getting there and learning about the special unlimited meals in the upstairs section climbed the stairs and sat down at a marble topped table in a few minutes a server placed a banana leaf in front of me with many small steel bowls another server came by and filled the utensils with different south indian vegetarian preparations i was served rice papadums sambar and rasam and after asking for a fork started attacking what was in front of me never having expected to finish all my rice i was surprised when the server came around for more to find myself welcoming another helping it is unlimited and they will keep serving you until you say enough the stomach will get filled even if the palate will keep wanting more i have enjoyed this experience so many times without tiring of it often to the frustration of my wife who would like to try other terrific restaurants indian or otherwise on this magnificent gastronomic gem called singapore my big frustration is that if komala vilas in singapore can serve such delicious and perfectly prepared south indian food why cannot other similar restaurants outside india particularly those in the us do so even if some copy komala vilas name they fail to replicate its food if only the original komala vilas decides to expand to the san francisco bay area life could be so wonderful\",\"people are ridiculous for giving less than  stars because they want meat it is a vegetarian restaurant if you are not ok with that go elsewhere pretty simple but i guess it is too confusing for some we loved our meals here we  adult  kids were on a budget so we skipped drinks and used the pitcher of water at the table for  usd we managed to get really good meals for all of us if we had more to spend we would haved ordered more but it is good to know what you can eat for less in singapore we were upstairs and did have about a  minute wait for a table i did not mind since a busy restaurant typically is a good sign not sure if the experience differs on the first floor we will be back next time we are in town\",\"incredibly delicious vegetarian indian food nice family run place since  reasonably priced nothing fancy and filled with locals had the potato curry and chana masala with fresh baked burrita think that is the name bread that was the size of a child is head food was not killer hot spicy hot just pleasantly hot accompanied by a thick sweet mango lassi flavors were incredible loved it so much came back twice during a  day stay btw i am not normally into vegetarian anything but after eating here i could take that path samosas were hot spicy as they were loaded with peppers a piping hot chai masala was a nice way to end my meal do not miss if in singapore ps be sure to bring your own napkins\",\"really delicious authentic vegetarian south indian food i tried the masala dosa uttapam and samosas and all were delicious and cost less than  even for so much food only downside is that it is cash only\",\"the food here is similar to what i tasted when i was in india the masala tea smells good and reminds me the journey in india lots of people here especially india people maybe they can heal their homesick by eating their traditional food the servants are a little passive because they are too busy i guess try if you want to feel like being in india no worry about using hand or not they provide simple tablewares\",\"i have been on a martabak craze since i landed in sin about a  days ago and i had to go to this place their indian martabak is really good it is close to what i remembered all those years ago in indonesia however i think the indo indian martabak had other things in it besides just meat and the martabak itself regardless love this place the cik that was helping me was a little terse but nice enough to hook this brother up w a martabak at close to  pm terima kasih cik\",\"zam zam is one of the most famous place for din briyani in singapore with that it is extreme let crowded with tour groups dropping by to try it out the store is the same as it was  years ago and we sat at a table next to the kitchen i question their hygiene standards from what i saw nevertheless their dum briyani that cost  was yummy but i wo not say the best\",\"they have indoor and outdoor seating i elected to sit outside as it is located right across from some historic buildings in little india arab street it is a great spot for people watching over lunch the staff are very friendly i am an indecisive eater when it comes to new menus and they were able to make really helpful and delicious recommendations if you are the appetite bigger than your actual stomach type like me you can dine in and order take out at the same time the staff are super helpful with that this is also located in the optimal spot for anyone who has some time to take a stroll through the rest of little india arab street overall i would definitely recommend this place to other tourists who are in the area\",\"was lucky to get a seat as i stopped by with a group just as a fasting period was coming to an end the place was full and due to the holiday we were supposed to have put in an order earlier that day this left the only item on the menu to be the murtabak at first the group was a bit disappointed but then the murtabaks arrived i was stunned at how delicious they were and with the slight spice of the dipping sauce they disappeared from everyone is plate in a matter of minutes and they are fairly large definitely worth a trip\",\"this restaurant came highly recommended for indian food since our family was visiting the sultan mosque zam zam was a perfect choice since it was right across the street from the mosque we were seated on the second floor of the restaurant which had air conditioning yay there were many tables to be seated at but the tables were too close to each other so it felt quite cramped our waiter arrived to take our order we got the mutton murtabak mutton biryani and pulled hot milk tea everything that we ordered was delicious the murtabak tasted like an eggy floury pancake with tons of flavorful mutton inside also the rice in the biryani had a great fluffy texture they did not skimp on the mutton in this dish either what i was quite impressed with was the pulled milk tea it was such an aromatic tea and had the right amount of sweet condensed milk it was even better than the best pulled milk tea i have had in hong kong the only thing was that the customer service was quite brutish here it is probably best to be very direct with what you want to order you can point to the menu items you want to get also be sure to confirm your orders too since our waiter initially got our order wrong he had to flag down another waiter to help him make sure our order was correct otherwise when i visit singapore again i will definitely be back here for their delicious food and milk tea\",\"tried something new on arab street yelp led me to zam zam where i enjoyed the chicken murtabak flour eggs onion and chicken with a little bit of spice views of the masjid sultan friendly staff explained the menu and food was out in less than  minutes\",\"starssingapore zam zam is a busy busy indian muslim food restaurant near bugis there is open air seating on the first floor and a much larger air conditioned dining room on the second floor to eat we started with the mutton biryani which was a pile of basmati rice with a tender piece of mutton in the center and a creamy curry on the side though tasty i found the rice to be rather bland compared to some other biryanis i have had since it was not actually cooked with the meat or with many spices we also had the special deer murtabak a stuffed flatbread filled with ground deer and egg overall the murtabak was rather bland and flavorless it came with a curry on the side for dipping but otherwise had almost no flavor on the plus side the portion sizes here were definitely generous for the price but i cannot say i get the hype about zam zam\",\"authentic murtabak and briyani according my friend from saudi arabia my first time trying the cuisine and it was delicious we finished all of our food and ordered a second mutton murtabak cuz it was that good teh ice iced milk tea is a must try as well\",\"zam zam thank you ma am this place is right on arab street directly in front of the sultan mosque the specialization here is biryani and murtabak i found the biryani to be on the bare side it is got a good mix of spices for complexity and although the mutton was tender and easy to peel i have had better murtabak is very good the deer option is their popular one and it is good it is an ideal shareable item it is pretty bulky and it is filling they are generous with the meat portion inside also you can try the fish head curry my opinion it is just okay it makes for a good picture but i found the actual fish to be rather tough not as flaky peel able this place has been featured on some travel programs and it is also a popular youtube travel vlog destination that said despite being a legitimate landmark mamak shop i will say that the food is good but not amazingly outstanding as i initially expected if you are from malaysia you probably will not be impressed and there is a  chance you will say brag to some extent about how the mamak food in malaysia is better than singapore otherwise this food will probably blow your tourist mind away it is good though\",\"loved the food i was visiting sultan mosque and read reviews of zam zam it is right across from the mosque never had murtabak before so tried mutton biryani and murtabak and it was great very reasonable prices and great food\",\"yes definitely yes good eats and reasonably priced we had the mutton briyani and deer murtabak they provide complimentary curry on the side it was delicious it is located in little india i highly suggest going to this restaurant instead of one of the restaurants in little india is main streets haji lane and arab st because they are so overpriced the food here is tasty tasty tasty you will see a lot of locals here which is a good sign it was a good find for us enjoyed it go upstairs there is air conditioning\",\"as good as the hype said but service was a little spotty be prepared to be accosted on the street as you walk up and pressured into ordering before you look at the menu the small is huge so be prepared for a food coma\",\"amazing service everyone is extremely friendly and the food comes relatively quickly tried the beef murtabek chicken biryani and mutton curry all were excellent the chicken was succulent and the sauce from the mutton curry was really flavorful\",\"we found singapore zam zam on the lonely planet guidebook we wanted to try the murtabak a halal malaysian stuffed pancake we had a choice of beef mutton chicken or sardines we chose the chicken murtabak the chicken murtabak was excellent with the gravy sauce that came on a separate bowl the murtabak was otherwise bland tasting without the gravy the iced coffee was refreshing and complemented the murtabak they have a system to determine which coffee drink had milk versus none sugar versus sugar free i recommend stopping for at least a snack at zam zam when visiting kampong glam in singapore\",\"must go restaurant when you are visiting haji lane very authentic muslim food and price is cheap too i think most of the tourist and local people eat at this location there is st floor and nd floor if you are seated on st floor ask the server to be seated at second floor since there is air condition i noticed that restaurant employees seats local people on st floor and tourists on nd floor i tried biryani murtsbak and fish head curry love the sauce when you eat with biryani great combination\",\"best indian food that i had in singapore i would eat here every week if i could yum every dish we tried was great\",\"this is a good place to go for a quick fix of mutton biryani despite being very popular i find their food to be on the average side do not expect a quite place where you can enjoy sitting down to talk with your friends zam zam is more like an oversized street food establishment with a roof on our top\",\"the food here is soooo good my friend and i saw that this place got great reviews so we decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed service is not the best and the servers are not the nicest but the food definitely makes up for it do not overlook this place based on its appearance it is located right beside the famous arab street so for tourists like myself and my friend we could easily work over to explore the area right after we finished our meal a walk is also necessary after such a carb heavy meal tourists and non tourists alike have to try this place out\",\"chicken murtabak was the best dish of the meal it comes in small medium or large and a small size is good for one person the roti was nicely browned and the chicken was moist with lots of flavor we also tried the fish biriyani but the fish was rather dry and the rice was intermittently flavored perhaps it was supposed to be like that but i would have liked a more complex flavor the curry that came with it also tasted mildly of lamb which was a bit off putting the iced teh chio was quite yummy but my friend said the teh c was not sweet enough also the tea was still piping hot when they iced it making the bottom warm while the top cold which made for a rather inconsistent drink service was spotty at best we were sitting right by the staircase where there were constantly waiters running back and forth yet it was almost impossible to catch anyone is attention it is possible that zam zam may have been a top notch joint at some point but like many other restaurants complacence and laziness took over making the food passionless and mediocre\",\"stay away from the fruit drinks which for some reason though zam zam resides in a tropical country chock full of cheap tropical fruit like all the neighboring restaurants chooses to serve its blueberry juice with neon blue gatorade looking syrup and then have the gall to tell me it is blueberries no it is not stop the mutton murtabak is fairly tasty and is really helped out by the savory dal complete with sheep meat chunk to flavor it but they really skimp on the meat filling the pastry mostly with onions for  i expect some meat particularly in a city where  usually gets you full to bursting mutton is a strongly flavored meat and if i have to cock my head and concentrate to taste it you are not using enough\",\"first off ordering was confusing once you get close to the front of the line they call you to order your dishes on the right side of the stall you got to pick your dish and what size you want now a sgd meal is regular size after you order the dish you get back in line i went to the back but the guy waved me over to get back in my original spot this was confusing and new people like me will be like wtf i might have done it wrong too the line was not too long when we arrived at am on a weekday you get the benefit of the drink stall next door to order drinks it is fun watching the chef create the dish at the front of the line i got the dry and soup noodles as for the soup noodles i did not get much flavor in the noodles i was questioning what was the hype but then after trying the broth i knew that was the key very flavorful and very thoughtful how they created this dish the dry noodle dish is good as well it has strong vinegar taste to it also the soup provided is on the sour side all very good i can see it getting hot eating here you are eating hot food after all prepare yourself with fans and cold drinks\",\"simple delicious made with heart have you ever eaten at a michelin starred spot for  not only is singapore a dope vacation destination but it has cheap delicious food i do not read chinese and did not quite know if the menu was going to have any english so i chose what i wanted ahead of time bak chor mee with dry noodles omg this noodle dish is gooooood must be the black vinegar that makes it there are so many different flavors that go into this one dish it manages to incorporate all of the five basic tastes as well as other textures downside  long queue to order  im told the price went up with popularity upside  deliciousness  only takes only a few minutes to prepare is it worth it i think so recommend double the noodles and add the soup\",\"they have a few outlets and we went to the one in upper cross street inside hong lim food center this is a well known establishment whereby the founders started the first stall in  their pork dumplings are simply delicious and my family always makes it a point to order an extra bowl to share on top of our s  bowl of minced pork noodle we have tried many stalls of such noodles and i dare say that tai hwa rates as one of the best in fact the original stall in hill street made it into the michelin  guide for singapore\",\"hawker center food is on everyone is list when they go to singapore and we started our experience at tai hwa for lunch after waiting in the queue for almost an hour getting berated by the other stall owners for taking over what used to be a local establishment and feeling rather mediocre on the food from tai hwa i am not sure this is worth going out of your way for do i think it is a great value for the price paid yes absolutely would i go out of my way to come here probably not singapore has many fantastic places that allow you to stretch your dollars as far as you can but unless you are nearby to tai hwa i would opt for another place\",\"we showed up on a monday and saw literally no one in line cause they were closed so we tried again the next day right at am before our flight out at noon thinking that we had plenty of time in between man we were wrong first off we did not know that we should have got there even earlier to claim one of the  tokens that will keep your first  spots before the line even started to form so although there were only about  people in front of us when we got in line it took them   hour total to go through those  tokens and the people in front of the line and at least  other to go orders which i think should have been taken care of only after those people who are actually waiting in person food we ordered  bak chor mee and they were tasty it is a shame that we had to inhale our food right away to leave for the airport and not so much enjoying it after the long wait overall i think i can go somewhere else for similar noodles without the wait and cheaper price tag not that  was expensive but singapore just offers so many options for cheap eat the verdict i am glad that i tried their noodles and it was honestly really good i can see why they got the michelin star however i would only go back if the wait is a lot shorter and definitely not before catching a flight in less than  hours\",\"it is a great spot in singapore but i feel like it is jumped the shark a bit you will find the long lines but not of locals but of tourists i have had better pork noodles in singapore at a cheaper price and shorter wait yes the noodles stand out but i feel like the soup and ingredients were standard the fish cracklins were great though crunchy and flavorful it is a try if in the area but i would not go out of ones way to get a bowl\",\"long lines for this place i was here mid day and there was still a steady lineup of  people or so people i ordered the bak chor mee after about  minutes standing in line they make  bowl at a time and some guy ordered  the noodles are tossed in a vinegar chilli oil and soy sauce mix which is then topped with what tasted like pork liver minced pork a couple of wontons a couple of meatballs and some additional meat slices there was also a dehydrated fried fish slice on top they tasted very different from noodles i have had in the past but definitely enjoyed it take some additional chilis to add to your bowl\",\"since this was listed on the michellin guide i have to give it a try i planned an early dinner visit to avoid the long queues that people reported arrived at pm and there was a queue but tolerable waited  minutes for my food a good estimate of wait time is count the number of people in front of you multiply by  as each is likely ordering for  people then multiply by  again as it takes  mins to prepare a bowl of noodles so of people in front of you  average wait time is it worth waiting more than  mins i do not think so the bak chor mee minced pork noodles is ok nothing to scream about i had the  dry version with mee pok flat yellow egg noodles good presentation with a big bowl and generous with the meat sliced pork minced pork sliced liver gyoza and deep fried fish ti po a dash of lettuce and no braised mushrooms the black vinegar used for the sauce is flavorful which makes bak chor mee good there is a ji chai soup for  which in my mind is way over priced dried seaweed is put into the broth used for the soup version of bak chor mee can skip without missing anything a good dry version of bak chor mee needs to have mushroom sauce and nice vinegar this place missed out on the mushroom presentation wise tai hwa has it better than others the over sized bowl makes the noodles very appealing to the eye remember it still has a lot of carbs my suggestion is to go at off peak times order the  dry or soup version and if wait is longer than  mins come back another time\",\"one of the cheapest michelin star food you can get the meat balls are super delicious some times you will have to q for an hour to order\",\"noodle in general is good abit salty for me but still ok lar however queues up for   for a bowl of pork noodle maybe not as worth though u decide\",\"famous michelin star bak chor mee stall in sg the noodle here is very flavorful strong flavors across sweet salty sour spicy which makes the bak chor mee standout they also give you a lot of sides to accompany the noodle sliced pork minced pork wonton meatballs liver noodle crisps everything taste excellent and a good balance to the noodle portion is big which probably explains the above average price would go back again if in the area however while this is a very good bak chor mee it is probably not good enough to warrant  hour wait during peak hours\",\"this place gets  stars for the  hour wait it just might not be worth it i know i would not line up again the only incredible part of this is how slow the line moves the food is pretty good and would be on my  star list also has a michelin star if there was not a line the liver is extremely well done and tender the noodles are pretty good but does this make it significantly better than other bak chor mee places nah it is the best you will get but not worth the wait if you can go elsewhere i would try it once if there is almost no line and that is it people line up before they open so maybe consider getting there very early\",\"you can write   yelp reviews while on queue i personally did not mind the wait and thoroughly enjoyed the noodles after  hr of waiting maybe i was just hungry i wish i had ordered a larger bowl after waiting for that long i am not sure if i would be back but it is definitely a place to try out at least once because if its michelin status\",\"pretty solid place with some awesome flavours i had the dry noodles and it was really awesome to get so many different pork meat varities in different forms the sauce is a bit spicy and the soup delicious not something i would wait for but worth a one time visit\",\"now that it has received a michelin star there are more tourists joining the queue for some bak chor mee we went at pm on a friday and it still took about  minutes to wait in line for the food there were about  people ahead of me but we saw there were only  people in line at pm hard to find the sweet spot on when the wait will be shortest the queue system is neater now halfway through the wait maybe   people ahead of you you will be asked to place your order on the right side and then go back to your queue spot to wait the noodle tasted better when eaten at the coffee shop i ordered the  bowl as recommended by other yelpers and it definitely had more ingredients than what i previously remembered i would have skipped the meatball soup if i knew there were more  meatballs in the  portion i ended up with too many meatballs as the soup came with  meatballs for  it was soft but a bit on the salty side i still gave it a  stars because of the queue system not everyone can stand for that long i rather you order it and then get a number or buzzer and wait\",\"michelin stars the dish is delicious let is get that right out of the way so much so that i have spent some time now at home replicating the magic that is tai hwa pork noodle obviously my homemade version is not as good but with some tweaks i think it could be a passable substitute here is where the wheels fall off the wagon it is cheap and has a lot of fan fare because of the single star it is received on our first attempt we waited for about   hours and only moved  tiles we used the tiles on the floor to determine how far we had to go which was not much we gave up we returned the next morning  minutes before opening and received number  if you guys are missing a number  i might know why it was another hour wait before we got our food this time we were determined which was delicious as i have mentioned the whole ordeal of waiting in the heat of singaporean weather was just lost on me yes the food was delicious yes it was cheap but for a michelin star you have to do something above and beyond i feel like with the thousands of hawker stalls all over singapore you could more places similar to this with delicious food and less of the brouhaha it is the challenge that yelp and michelin diners face seek these places out find the undiscovered gems in areas that people may not frequent blaze the trail for others to follow do not just let your choice of place be governed by these yelp ratings which are always way too subjective you might find something you really like a diamond in the rough\",\"line may seem long but only because the chef takes so long to make each bowl i personally waited almost two hours and the dish was not exceptional or anything i had not tasted before many other better options nearby but significantly less wait\",\"as i was on a michelin food hunt that day after eating the soy sauce chicken in chinatown i immediately headed over to this noodle place for lunch unlike the other stall they do not really advertise their michelin star and the only way you will know about it is a small plaque at the very front of the line i got there at lunch time and it was a little over an hour wait be warned that it can get quite hot and humid while waiting as there was only one fan aimed at the queue whilst lining up i noticed there were signs for a    and  noodle asking around people said that they were simply denoting the size of noodles but after receiving my order that is not quite the case ordering was a bit daunting but somehow i managed to communicate for a  dry non spicy bak chor mee watching him prepare your bowl of noodle was quite confusing he was dipping meats and noodles and sauces into different bowls before dumping them all into one then after handling the raw meats with his bare hands he will handle your cash payment when i got my order i noticed my soup was lacking the seaweed that i had seen in the pictures and inquired why they simply stated it was because i ordered the  version the full version was at  so i found out the hard way the pricing did not dictate size alone the noodle came with some minced pork some liver a meatball a wonton and some crunchy meat that i could not identify texturally the dish was very interesting with bites alternating between crunchy and soft as you ate in terms of the flavor profile it really was not for me the vinegar was simply too overpowering and i do not really get the hype with this dish the side bowl of soup was also quite bland nothing really special if you are a fan of sour and spicy it might be worth it to give it a try despite the wait but for people that have a penchant for more savory flavors give this place a pass\",\"one word amazing we went on a tuesday morning thinking it would not be packed but when we got to the store at around   there was already roughly  people in line after roughly  hours in the brutal heat and watching countless happy customers bypass us with their freshly cooked noodles we finally got our orders in and let me say this the wait was totally worth it the noodles were hand pulled very flavourful after soaking up the vinegary soup base there was a wide selection of minced pork liver sliced pork wontons and crispy fish on the side of the bowl plus you could add freshly chopped chili peppers on top to enhance the flavours the combination of all the toppings was like heaven in a bite crunchy savoury sour and spicy definitely cant go wrong with a meal this good especially with the pricing being  for medium\",\"i got to tai hwa  minutes after opening and waited in line  hour  minutes i appreciated that each batch of meat was cooked to order for just the right amount of time ensuring tender pork and liver the noodles were springy and the sauce punchy and well balanced while i definitely enjoyed my noodles it was not amongst my favorites in singapore if i lived in the neighborhood i would visit again otherwise i am sure places with equally delicious noodles and a shorter wait exist just have to be in the know i guess\",\"well yelp never lets me down came to vatos for dinner after needing a break from hawker stalls so i browsed yelp and that is where we ended up my bf and i shared  orders of two tacos each the beef brisket pork belly and fish tacos they were all very delicious and although the taco tortilla appeared small they were stacked to the sky with protein it is not a very traditional mexican place because those places usually do two tortillas per taco but i enjoyed these tacos thoroughly and i would come back if i ever visited singapore again\",\"this place is stashed away in the dip but conveniently located in the beach road complex which is a beautiful creation and area to stay and play in we were greeted promptly and seated promptly the menu was easy to read and the space is great as well as the music and shall i say the entertainment which i deemed as entertaining by way of the chef cooking and dancing to despasito he had tons of rhythm once i dig into the menu i was so excited to see that they had vegan options my vegan tacos were super yummy my husband had shrimp and chicken tacos which he loved our son had cheese quesadilla and he ate it all my sister in law had shrimp tacos with pico on the side she enjoyed we all were very fond of the house chip and dip as it was fresh and the red sauce was super flavorful and my favorite of the two provided as we received a green sauce as well that our toddler liked since it was not as spicy this place is a must do when in singapore especially if you are a vip member of my travel club as we earn travel upon paying our tab win win win\",\"who knew i would be drinking a beer from northern california brewery eating asian mexican fusion food in singapore i thought it was awesome they had lost coast brewery is stout as a beer option here if i am going to pay singapore prices for alcohol might as well be a craft beer right the korean po boy was pretty filling loved the house chips here pretty huge but with the green was bomb\",\"ugh it is just about average food can be a little dry and staff pretty disengaged quite loud inside really hard to hold a conversation\",\"vatos urban tacos knows exactly what they are doing when it comes to authentic mexican tacos i gotta say that i was a little hesitant to go for tacos in singapore i mean if i sometimes cannot find good tacos in the usa which is just north of the border from mexico how was i going to find real tacos in singapore but i was wrong obviously not all of their menu is authentic mexican they do have a lot of tacos and dishes which are a fusion of mexican with korean and other styles to keep it traditional we order the tacos de carne asada and to try something new had the tacos de pollo con kimchi the carne asada tacos were legit the meat was so tender and flavorful the red salsa was spicy and delicious and the tortilla was made to perfection the carne asada tacos definitely made me think about my hometown of ciudad juarez in mexico the kimchi chicken tacos were also really good and fresh but i gotta say they were a little too oily for my taste and could barely taste the chicken it was definitely something i had never tried before and i actually kind of like it also we were here on a tuesday and they had a deal of  tacos for the price of  winning\",\"good for americans who need a taste of home while on vacation the service was good and the food was better the menu needs to state all ingredients we had a vegan with us who requested the vegetable burrito bowl and asked for the crema to be left off it does not say there is cheese on it but it came with cheese when we explained the person was vegan they immediately fixed it they were apologetic and fixed it with no issues their nachos are some of the best\",\"the food was average the staff were lacklustre and i left thinking the place was run like it did not matter that you have paid a fair bit for a good night out worse of all no one else seemed to care that they were paying high prices for really average food and service not a good investment in a night out compared to mexican restaurants in la or vegas this was pale in comparison\",\"as a california native i can assure you the food is on point while visiting singapore with my family we visited vatos on a whim mexican food in southeast asia it was incredible the guacamole and og margarita were excellent no bottled mix here just tons of fresh lime juice the korean fusion elevates traditional mexican dishes to a whole new level you have got to try the kimchi carnitas fries they are out of this world the fat bastard burrito bowl lives up to it is name it is ginormous but very tasty loved the addition of a crispy cheese layer to the quesadilla a note to another reviewer freshly made corn tortillas are supposed to be thin i am sorry we were too full for dessert the place was busy and as others have noted loud but the service was good overall i would highly recommend\",\"awesome place great fusion tacos loved the korean galbi tacos and the shrimp tacos were incredible will definitely be back i wish there were  stars\",\"first things first do not be alarmed when your party is food does not arrive at the same time the plates are delivered as they come out of the kitchen you will see this throughout singapore vatos tacos is a delightful mexican korean fusion that offers a break from the oodles of noodles sorry could not help myself and rice you will consume whilst in singapore chips more accurately tortillas and salsa are complimentary with your visit what i got and what i thought  chimichurri chicken urban taco delicious would absolutely have this again the chimichurri was perfectly tangy and a great complement to the spicy chicken while it did have a nice kick to it i finished the tacos without a tingling sensation on my lips as long as you can handle a couple of chilies you will be golden if you are interested in a dish that has the fire emblem next to it but you are worried about spice just ask the waitstaff what you need to prepare for  honey tequila chicken wings best part of the meal and a great option to share with the table as you could surmise from the name of the dish the wings are sweeeeeeeeeeet but they do come covered in slices of chilies the heat fearing members of my party were able to fully enjoy the wings by removing the chilies this is a simple task vegan and vegetarian options are available\",\"good food nice environment great selection almost to much to choose from only service was lacking a bit with plenty of staff they could have gotten us to order a few more margaritas had they only asked and never asked us we wanted desert by the time we got the bill we did not\",\"mexican food in singapore yes absolutely yes if it is what your craving this is the place chips and salsa drinks and the food is good loved the salsa\",\"first night in singapore and fou d this hidden gem it needs to be on your must try list chimichuri street tacos with enough heat to numb your lips but filled with so much flavor you wo not stop eating\",\"long story short  for a margarita is insane go somewhere else for a drink only go on taco tuesday to get  tacos for the price of  at  service could be improved greatly i waited at least  mins to place my order the barbacoa tacos were delicious but i wo not be back\",\"the place was having korean mexican filipino thanksgiving party with iskina cebu the place was packed but lucky i had made a reservation in advance we were showed to a high chair table by side the place was quite noisy with tables spread to the walkway as outside was raining chimichurri lechon tacos s   pieces handmade tortilla ssamjang aioli iskinu cebu lechon chimichurri salsa the serving was quite small it was quite messy to handle the tacos the flavours were yummy jalapeo pork belly lechon tacos s   pieces handmade tortilla ssamjang aioli iskinu cebu pork belly lechon pickled onions jalapeos relish the serving was quite small it was quite messy to handle the tacos the flavours were yummy i am rick james peach s  frozen peach margarita tecate beerthe margarita was served in a glass with the beer bottle upside down it was not too sweet oh man i was red like a peach after having the drink did not get to try the roasted chicken which was also that night special item as it was sold out by the time we placed order\",\"reservations highly suggested we came on a random tuesday night and this place was packed since we came all this way we did not want to improvise so we said we would order for take away luckily a table opened up during our wait because the expected wait time is between  minutes to  hours judging from the crowd anticipation filled our hungry souls the menu is not extensive but enough to make you ponder about what to order we looked at the menu for a good  minutes before we decided on what to order dinner all of us got the fat bastard burrito bowl this was our favorite thing here my colleagues and i could not stop raving about it the rice the sour cream the beans the carne asada was beautifully and deliciously executed the kimchi fries were pretty good the kimchi had a kick and i loved the jalapeos the fries seemed to come out of a bag though the galbi no rice burrito i had the following day for lunch was packed the galbi was tender and let is just say that it was too good to eat just half of it i loved how tender yet firm the black beans are the sauces that it came w only elevated the overall taste no sauce needed craving a burrito bowl now\",\"traveling alone on business with a free day in singapore after visiting the national museum i decided to stop here for lunch street tacos are pretty common back in the us and this looked intriguing i will admit the bar is pretty high given the quality of this type of food back home but i thought i would give it a shot while i really wanted this to be good there were several negatives the first of which is they only will serve a two taco minimum so if you are a party of one and you want to sample three different tacos you are out of luck it is only  of one type or  of two types etc no big deal if you are dining with friends but cut me some slack i am a party of one who really wanted to sample your food and you would not do it even with a polite request to make an exception so i ordered  pork barbecoa and they were delicious so delicious i was wishing i could have tried some others the cowboy queso on the other hand was so bland and tasteless it is as if someone just melted some plain cheese in a bowl so we are batting   on food quality then there is the service kind of disinterested and bothered would he how i would describe it ordered a beer and a water with my meal and the water never showed my server never showed again either and i had to all but stand up and wave my arms when it was time to go it is a pretty nice place and the one taco i tried was delicious but beyond that there is not much to recommend here and given the negatives i am not sure i would come back so much excellent food in singapore so lots of other options\",\"so where do i begin opened about a month ago vatos is definitely a cool spot to grab a bite and or drinks the margarita drinks look crazy with the inverted bottle of beer cider plunged into the frozen margarita glass as for the food for me it is not something new and exciting roy choi started the whole korean taco theme in los angeles circa  and it is been duplicated around the world i am still looking for the place in sg that serves up the tex mex cali mex versions that my palate is familiar with do not get me wrong vatos is a great choice for asian influenced mexican street food the tacos were how do i put it tasty but unsubstantial maybe i am jaded by being from california but  for a couple of tacos is kinda pricey the homemade tortillas were good but a little thin the flavors were a mash up of mexican and korean which i enjoyed the kimchi carnitas fries were a bit salty do not know if the fries were salted hopefully not because the kimchi cheese and carnitas were already sodium loaded would come back again because there are things on the menu i still want to try mucho gusto\",\"this place is just mediocre the food is not as flavorful as it should be it is overpriced and the service is poor\",\"finally made it for taco tuesday four of us ordered the happy hour kimchi carnitas fries and  types of tacos kimchi carnitas fries   starsgreat dish to share but we all did not remember there was kimchi till halfway through perhaps there was not much kimchi in it to begin with galbi beef taco  starsthis was my favorite we gathered that it was slightly sweet so those who were not fond of sweet mains picked the prawn one as their favorite chili and lime prawn taco  starsthis was my second favorite the prawns were fried well and still crisp warm and flavorful when i had them fish taco   starsi do not know if it is because i had this after the prawn taco that by then it had gotten way too soggy and the breading was too thick and just tasted like oil granted there was a decent amount of fish in it carne asada taco  starstoo spicy for all of us not much flavor i remember  for  of us so that is a very decent  each and i am still full the morning after does this make me  taco girl d not sure i am dying to go back though i guess i would have to try their burritos a bit noisy for dinner conversation and i am getting to the age where i do not like yelling over the dinner table anymore\",\"yesss the good news i can finally cross santouka off my man i wanna try that one day list the bad it is now on a cravings list and  is not exactly what you want to spend on lunch everyday the deal lunch sets are excellent spicy fans go for the kara miso broth its depth of flavor really sets this place apart from other places the sitch i suspect i reaaalllyyy enjoyed this lunch because the place was empty super late lunch and the servers were still so super friendly and attentive throughout i imagine the eating experience would be very different at peak hours when you are basically sitting on top of the person next to you tl dr eat lunch here at a non peak time for ramen you wo not regret\",\"a bit difficult to find nd floor far corner looking at the hotel and river mapquest has a different name not helpful ramen santouka is what you have to plug in and you have to know nd floor had better ramen in tokyo dah but good and inexpensive for table service in singapore  beers gyoza salad and soft boiled egg ramen was only  singapore dollars   us the salad was super fresh beers were great  tiger and  asahi ramen good pork was a bit too fatty for me good and friendly service\",\"great location and great food for someone who is not well versed in raman or even like soup there are other options to choose from here that can satisfy the ol appetite my co worker and i shared the yaki gyoza which were excellent i also had their fried chicken which i would go back just to have that again and i had a salad which was a good side but honestly cannot remember much about it anymore my co worker had one of the ramen bowls which he thought was pretty good but i do not think it is the best he is ever had location is great as it is right on the quay the restaurant is fairly small so it is more intimate and i did not feel like my food was mass produced service was kind of interesting as i was not sure if they choose not to attend tables unless required but they were polite and helpful when we did flag someone down you pay at the desk not at the table which no one explained to us so we sat for quite some time at the table i would totally come here again\",\"this place is amazing the staff is extremely courteous and helpful each person that came to our table was so nice the food was beyond delicious i had the original ramen with pork and gyoza each little gyoza was perfect and tasted like it was made with jesus tears i highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a happy belly a fantastic experience\",\"one of the best ramen really authentic japanese ramen love the spicy version with cheeks the cheeks are really tender and melt in your mouth the only reason on why i do not give  stars is due to the side dishes i thought they are only average try both chicken karagee and fried pork dumpling both are average keep with the ramen it is the good one\",\"everything we had was super good and we wished we could eat more even after being full the pork cheeks were unbelievable and everyone should have them at least once in their life we also had the miso soup delicious the salmon salad and sushi\",\"nice place second floor above the street facing clark quay ordered the special ramen which was great flavor rich with very nice tender pork and the bun less recommended and the fried pork gioza which were really tasty\",\"the broth was delicious it is one of the best i have had in singapore i got the spicy miso with the pan fried dumpling set and savored every bite i have to agree that the chasiu was not as tender as i would have liked but that broth the dumplings were some of the most flavorful i have had the staff were very friendly as well and helpful when narrowing down choices i cannot wait to go back\",\"the ramen was superb i upgraded from pork belly to pork cheeks amazingly fall apart tender and quite lean and i had the spicy miso base which was not that spicy just enough to make it interesting the noodles were thick but still al dente good mouth feel the chicken karage was delicious and the gyoza were almost perfect my only complaint in the course of an hour we heard an endless loop of kenny g despite how good the ramen is it does not make up for the audible torture i had to endure my tip definitely try this but bring your earphones\",\"honestly i have had much better ramen the the bay area but it is the first ramen i have had in singapore i was craving ramen so gave this a shot it took me awhile to find i left decently full but found the shoyu ramen to be too salty also the salty and fatty pork cheek added to the saltiness the atmosphere was nice because you can look out onto the river the only issue was the waiter consistently kept trying to upsell add ons to the ramen and dishes to multiple tables around it was annoying the upsell table by table and then the customers would just say no question after question they should know when to stop asking in my opinion or just not be so aggressive with the upsell which is why i decreased my review from a  to  stars not the best ramen and for the price i could try another place rather than returning i will have to update this review when i try other ramen in singapore tip seems like they are a part of certain promotions with credit cards etc it may be worth checking out of the deals and if it is available for santuoka\",\"great food good service reasonable prices a little tricky to find in the upstairs location but once you are there it is very good it is also not very touristy for being right in clarke quay i have been a few times for lunch and dinner and it is always very tasty i always get the standard ramen base and it is always so salty and flavorful will continue to go back\",\"hands down my fave ramen in town so good it was one of my bucket list of final places to eat during my last week living here seriously the pork cheeks are melt in your mouth amazing and the broth is equally as tasty even the service is well above average for singapore standards you wo not leave disappointed\",\"yum while visiting singapore i had been looking for a place with decent food along the quay is found this via yelp and while it is up inside the clarke mall there is still a view of the river and action below i think i arrived rather late for dinner on a weeknight but there was no wait i was alone and was seated immediately i ordered one of the set menu is with prawns ramen and salad etc and it was a lot of food probably enough for two it was so much that i could not finish and they asked me upon checkout if everything was ok i thought that was nice they were concerned but it was delicious i just could not eat it all atmosphere is pretty standard but service and food was above average i would recommend for lunch or dinner\",\"i am only home for   weeks and i have a long list of things i want to eat singapore is known for being a culinary haven if you are a foodie come to singapore i guarantee you will not be disappointed with so many options and only  stomach i had to make very smart and wise decisions every food choice is strategic it has to be the best if not why bother there are tons of ramen places in san francisco bay area however i always tell my friends nothing beats the options and quality available in singapore outside japan i think singapore is probably the only country with the most ramen shops per square mile there is fierce competition i researched and read reviews strategically planning which ramen shop to go to santouka was my final pick oh boy i was blown away the egg was perfectly cooked nicely set egg white and gooey soft egg yolk the shio broth was flavorful and not overly greasy you can pretty much drink up all the broth and not feel coagulated fat swimming in your stomach the noodle texture was great and it did soak up some of the flavor from the broth the pork jowl omg and omg one more time one bite and i felt my life is now compete well seasoned and cooked perfectly it tasted better than the pork jowl i had at lazy bear recently i have been to japan numerous times ate many bowls of ramen i must say i am in love with santouka ramen\",\"one of the best ramen in singapore tucked away and hard to find but worth the hunt had the kara miso vegetable ramen and it was delicious lightly spicy not too salty or oily just the way i like it give this place a try if you have not already\",\"good ramen and soup at good value nice views too i really like the kara miso ramen better then my expectation naturally i finished the bowl or noodles and the soup never one to waste my friend had the normal miso soup base apparently it taste just as good the gyoza is surprisingly moist inside and the skin is very thin i think they got the balance right the service is prompt and attentive too bad they only allow downsizing of the noodles but no upsizing i love good noodles so its a bit disappointing the afternoon sunny view of the river is a bonus i bet it looks better at night with all the clarke quay neon\",\"for a delicious fulfilling ramen quick fix come here i always get the pork cheek and shio ramen but my friend who had the miso was quite disappointed as the miso base does not taste much of miso in my opinion the only flavors that should be on the menu are spicy miso and shio one word shiok\",\"yelp brought me here i was staying in the area so it was a short walk for me to come here for lunch on a rainy day i am not a huge fan of ramen but wanted to see what the rave was about it was great broth and noodles where perfect and i ate everything i am giving it a  star because of the price point i think it was on the expensive side and ramen is not expensive also it took me awhile to find the location as it is hidden if you are in the central or clarke quay and looking for ramen come back here i am a fan\",\"my favourite ramen in the many ramen chains here love shoyu while other broth pales in comparison or stinks of pork bones that i seriously considered conversion of my religion santouka has a delicious soup base strangely enough i could do without the pork cheeks i am just contented with the soup it is nice and rainy now coming to this page is agony to my tummy\",\"located in the purple zone and also a corner of central is ramen santouka this was their first outlet in singapore their second outlet resides in cuppage plaza in orchard road santouka is founder hitoshi hatanaka opened his own ramen shop at hokkaido in  because he was unsatisfied with all other ramen establishments its thin noodle ramen with elegant broth topped perfectly with mouthwatering slices of char siu pork and pickled plums gained popularity in hokkaido immediately now in  there is outlets of ramen santouka all across the globe and my friends even mentioned the outlet in la tasted better than the outlet in singapore looking through the menu you realize that you get to pick your soup base be it shoyu soy sauce flavour miso soybean shio salt flavour or kara miso spicy soybean at  more the dining area of ramen santouka is a rather elongated one that stretches into the kitchen the chef is able to see every customer who walks in and walks out and for every customer that walks out the chef will say thank you for patronizing them it is very typical of japanese ramen shops in japan to be small and compact so that the chefs are also able to witness the customer is experience with their ramen miso ramen medium   i went with my lone favourite miso i admit the bowl looked small but it was deep after my first few dips with my chopstick i realized i was looking at the chance of skipping beard papa for desserts later the broth itself was thick and you could see a thin layer of oil swimming on the top it was not too gerlat as much i managed to drink quite a bit of the soup the noodles are the winner here they are extremely springy similar to that of maggie noodles and yet without the waxy exterior that instant noodles give you the texture of the noodles were consistent throughout the entire serving the bambo shoots here were also crunchy and since they absorbed all the flavour from the soup they sure were tasty the two glorious slices of char siew were not fatty at all instead they were tender pieces of juicy meat that again absorbed all the goodness from the soup i enjoyed my bowl of ramen as it did not have me craving for water like the ramen from other competitors which are ladden with msg leave me\",\"gorgeous temple inside and out it is lit up at night per their website but we visited in am i was told to cover my shoulders with a shawl from the pile at the temple entry some had to wear full robe if your shorts or mini skirt are too short the hundreds of buddhas are spectacular people go into pray and one of the monks conducted prayer chanting by microphone while we were there in the rear are buddhas who protect certain astrological signs we wanted to see the tooth relic of prince buddha you have to leave by the front door make a left turn and go downstairs where they serve vegetarian meals looks like a cafeteria at a senior center pass the dining area is an elevator you take upstairs there is a floor with all sorts of statutes including guan yin furniture from the past in display another floor houses the  teeth of buddha allegedly found by his student in buddha is funeral pyre after he died the teeth are in a gold container in a large gold room on the altar all behind glass it is an active prayer and meditation room you go in barefoot and shawls required if you are wearing sleeveless community pile shawls available above the shoe rack tops they do have a photo of the teeth so you can see no photos allowed in here another floor takes you to wax figures of past abbots the figures look so much better than at any wax museum i have seen even the hands have wrinkles from that floor it is a balcony and you can look down on the huge main prayer room on the st level there are drapes which are thin enough you can see through there is a garden floor on the roof not much of a garden but a big chime in a room with a temple worker walking in circle to cause a soft chiming noise the plaques of deceased line the walls up here very quiet and serene if you like to visit temples as much as we do you wo not be disappointed i would love to visit this temple again if we return to singapore\",\"i was in awe of this beautiful temple it was not crowded everyone was respectful and it was quiet as tourists we donated to each temple we visited and paid our respects i am sure the locals may get annoyed by tourists if you visit the tooth relic i believe on the third floor you must take off your shoes it is so peaceful in that room and you can even meditate this temple is exquisite and there is a ton to learn this is a nice and memorable visit for travelers\",\"one of the first things we went and saw in singapore due to it being close to our hotel and what a spectacular sight to see the temple was in amazing condition and like everything else in singapore it was clean friendly and inviting just as a note for the ladies if you are wearing shorts higher than your knees or a shirt that exposes your shoulders you will need to put a shaw over your clothing the temple has a bin full of them so you do not have to go out and buy one must see sight it is very calming and peaceful to walk inside and see the temple\",\"the temple is filled with beautiful and interesting artifacts and architecture gold is used throughout and makes the temple have a glow to it when you visit make sure to cover your shoulders and legs this applies to women for sure i was given a shawl to cover my shoulders as i had a tank dress on it was amazing to see the hundred buddha statues on the first floor my son and i just stared for a second as our senses were a little overwhelmed then there is an elevator to the fourth floor which is where the tooth is located it is enshrined in an enclosure and close circuit television allows you to look at the tooth was informed no one other than the most senior of monks are allowed into the area i do not know if i believe the tooth belonged to buddha but the temple itself is amazing to visit because we were with a tour we did not have time to properly wander in the temple but our brief visit still left an impression of wonder will have to come again to see the things we missed\",\"the temple opened in  and is built in the architectural style of the tang dynasty it houses the tooth relic of the historical buddha which you can view on the rth floor of the temple the temple is beautiful to view by day and by night it is free to enter if your shoulders are not covered you can grab a community shawl available at the entrance in a bin there are numerous floors to explore i recommend starting at the top roof garden and working your way down you can ask anyone at the front for guidance on how to find the elevator to the top floor the temple is ornate and beautiful the roof top garden is serene and peaceful the roof top is home to the ten thousand buddha pavilion inside is a very large vairocana prayer wheel every complete turn of the wheel will toll the wheel bell inside the prayer wheel are more than   copies of the vairocana dharani the temple also is home to a buddhist cultural museum with a vast collection of artifacts\",\"really interesting temple and museum the temple sections are beautiful with a prayer garden on the roof the museum sections give a really well done history of the life of the buddha and the birth of the religion very interesting and informative\",\"i came here for the tasty cheap food in the basement for a  donation you get rice and get to pick  entrees they are very generous with the portion tasty food and unbeatable price not a bad place for a quick casual meal\",\"i love this temple in chinatown smell of jasmine in the air i know it is not proper to take photos but cannot resist its beauty\",\"you have to see this place whether you are buddhist or not this is a must see the temple is absolutely beautiful inside you will find monks chanting many gorgeous statues and beautiful art if you are in chinatown you really should stop by it is free to get in and there is a nice gift shop if you are wearing shorts you will have to cover your legs with a brown apron that is provided\",\"really awesome temple there are  floors all of which we were able to go up but i guess sometimes certain rooms are closed depending on the schedule there are lots of really ornate beautiful areas of this temple including the buddha tooth part on the fourth floor i would definitely recommend a stop by here it is also near an excellent hawker center\",\"this temple is located in chinatown and is absolutely stunning i only walked through the first floor as it is almost chinese new year so it was quite busy as they were prepping for a special event that evening\",\"it is beautiful it is peaceful it is spiritual if you are a traveler like me wanna discover singapore and get epic photos come to this place it is also in chinatown you will find great chinese food as well you wo not be disappointed i promise\",\"i probably should have read the yelp reviews before i came in here because it appears that there is much more to this place that the two large temples that i visited down stairs however as i wandered around this building wandering where all of the teeth were because the main reason i came here was because i thought a tooth museum was sort of different and wanted to see all the teeth i do not remember seeing any way up to the upper levels maybe of should have asked with the exception of the doors that the monks where entering and leaving and i certainly was not going to go in there anyway i must admit that the artwork inside this place was nothing short of amazing and i walked around inside just marvelling at all of the statues i should advise that it is a functioning buddhist temple so you will see numerous ceremonies going on inside and for you ladies they do not particularly like you walking inside in shorts or skimpy dresses though the do offer wrap around aprons it is certainly an impressive place to visit if only to admire the artwork as was the case with me\",\"not another  star review look it is hard to argue with this one what am i going to say sorry buddha just not spiritual enough or perhaps hey it is just too expensive i do not think so as it is free of course there are collection boxes for a small donation but you know that you need all the help you can get in the afterlife so that is not going to kill you you cannot complain about it bring too strenuous as an elevator takes you most of the way to the top and when there are stairs they have provided an electronic grandmother chair for those that might not be able to climb oh by the way it is not a carnival ride so do not use unless you absolutely need to do so apparently such shenanigans are frowned upon in singapore yes this is a sight that is often overlooked in singapore but i say that it is a must see i suggest taking the elevator to the top and working your way to the roof garden it is worth it if for nothing more than spinning the giant prayer wheel after that make you way the room housing the tooth relic truly amazing another must see is the room one floor down which tells buddha s life story it was informative and entertaining this is a grata sight i came thinking that i would just spend  minutes but i spent an hour and no neither the electronic chair or the police had anything to do with my length of visit\",\"amazing open to the public buddhist temple with ornate decorations and beautiful sculptures make sure you are not wearing shorts and have your shoulders covered if not dear not as they have a bin of shawls that you can use to cover up also i was told that you are not supposed to step on the door frame so make sure you walk over it not on it we missed the buddha tooth relic supposedly there is an elevator that you take up to the th floor to the museum but we did not see it even without that portion of the temple though it was a great opportunity to see inside a temple and gaze at all of the tradition\",\"this is my mom is favorite temple where she comes almost everyday to help to do flower arrangements other chores for the temple volunteering from her heart soul today i try calling my mom she did not ask my call on the phone home so i get super worry for her so i try calling my mom is favorite temple these people whose there volunteered to help the temple should be full of kindness helpfulness in their heart soul but to my surprise they are not at all that helpful so disappointed not every helpful at all these people needs to have a more open heart soul amitabha\",\"beautiful rooftop garden and huge prayer wheel on the top level take the elevator all the way up then work your way down they have a buddhist history museum as well as buddhist art on display finally you get a nice view of the bottom level from the mezzanine be respectful no tank tops or above the knee shorts allowed cover up be quiet and no photos in certain areas\",\"absolutely beautiful temple it was the first time for me to enter a buddhist temple so to see their ceremony was also quite interesting for me\",\"the outside of this active buddha temple combined with museum appears of a chinese pagoda that sits in the heart of singapore chinatown free admission this temple incorporates elements of chinese tang dynasty of facade structures as the roof for chinese red is spilled in a modern structure in the shadow of the setting sun buddha tooth relic temple and museum depicts very chinese presence of buddhist mandala eminent sangha museum feature life stories of monks in singapore showcasing buddhist arts and culture morning chantings promptly begins at am daily and resident monks adhere a strict vegetarian food diet it immerses one deep into the buddhism life and culture for a better understanding i distinctly remember from my  visit non flash photography is permitted in the buddhist culture museum and eminent sangha museum note photography or filming of any device including mobile phones is strictly prohibited in the sacred relic chamber visitors are to abide in dressing modestly and avoid obscene appearance gentlemen pickup your pants to the waist line at the entrance and ladies no very low cut tops or mini skirts please tranquility is important with respect to the temple and its mission where visitors who are not buddhist nor religious in any shape or form are able to attain inner solace for a moment is peace from today is brutal ever changing world inscriptions are written in english and traditional chinese i like this temple for its beautiful open air garden atrium tourist trap indeed but worth a visit for the foreigner with an open mind\",\"buddha tooth relic temple and museum does worth a repeat visit it is located conveniently across from maxwell food centre so there is no excuse of me not dropping by every time when i am in town just going in and walking around admiring the architecture and enjoying a few moment of peace in my heart is worth the visit make sure visit the garden and the bell up on the roof a lot quieter and less crowded there is also the relic buddha tooth and the museum that you can visit aside from the main temple the best is everything is free and you can take as many photos as you want just dress properly but the temple does provide cover up if you are in your shorts and tanks so not to worry\",\"i hiked about  miles from my hotel through little india just to get here and it was so worth the walk there is outdoor seating for milder weather and indoor seating with a c which is a lifesaver if you are here at the height of summer the staff are very friendly and service is pretty fast though i will say that i purposely avoided the busiest hours because i wanted more time to sightsee and shop the food is amazing i know vindaloo is pretty much the most basic boring thing to get at an indian restaurant but the mutton vindaloo was probably the best i have had anywhere this far i like things very spicy and they matched what i asked for which as some of you spice lovers know does not always happen everywhere their naan was delicious and the spiced tea i got it iced was amazing definitely recommended if you are in the area\",\"probably the best indian food in singapore is their motto and i would have to agree the outdoor patio seating was packed at am so we were escorted to their upstairs lounge looking medieval and historic with brick i was glad we were able to enjoy a late night dinner in this room the food was perfect enjoyed their chicken kebab masala and garlic buttered naan very authentic flavors and was not afraid to use my hands to eat it would have been a perfect experience except for the below average service we were never greeted and had to flag down servers several times to get them to take a drink order i wanted to order another dish but never had the change or opportunity to i would suggest take out or maybe calling ahead to place an order i would definitely come back here when visiting little india and if you have an appetite past midnight they will surely accommodate\",\"came here for a late lunch on one of those crazy hot days and so thankful that they have a c setup upstairs it is hard for me to commit to just one dish when it comes to indian food so i caved to my cravings and ordered a variety rogan josh baingan bharta chicken tikka biryani and garlic naan yes i did eat it all by myself sauce on the rogan josh was great though would have preferred the mutton to be more tender paired with the fragrant biryani that sauce made a killer combo for carb coma afterwards garlic naan was incredible as well always get it with butter ghee the eggplant was solid but the sauce from the rogan josh stole the show chicken tikka was incredibly tender but thought the season was leaning on the salty side left completely satisfied will be back soon\",\"solid   stars came here for dinner during the week was pretty crowded even on a tuesday but we managed to get seated pretty quick it reminds you of restaurants in the s in india in a good way we got the hara bhara kebab and aloo tikki chaat to start off with was very tasty especially the kebab had garlic naan and paneer butter masala for mains again very tasty and very fresh i was super impressed and will be back to try their non veg options soon\",\"fantastic food the flavour superb i will definitely visit again\",\"the food was very delicious the best indian food i have tried while being in singapore the fish tikka masala had just enough spice the vegetable biryani was flavorful and the honey lemon tea satisfied my quench i will definitely go back\",\"fantastic food you talk about flavor this food was cooked just right we had the chicken masala and the mutton masala we would definitely have it again also so hot in singapore ask to go upstairs in the air con part of the restaurant\",\"i am a big fan of eating with my hands not that you have to they are have forks but when you order roti and stuff it with everything in your reach you really do not have a chance this food is delectable we passed by the first time in hope we would find something better maybe and no cigar we walked right back the place is not much to look at they are under construction the chairs are lawn chairs but who cares i am here to chow we had mutton kebab chicken tandoori mutton curry vegetable rice and roti with a side of white sauce just wow spicy delicious savory my mouth is watering i miss it so much the staff is a little stand off ish but once you get their attention they are incredibly nice food is fast we ordered and ate in a half hour bc we had a tour to catch i honestly will miss this place the most\",\"i am in sin a lot and a freind took me to this place in little india sat on the street corner in red plastic chairs and awaited with a pint of tiger in hand the smells emanating form the area are intense and the waft coming from khansama is hard to describe think pepe le pew floating in the air hooked on a dreaming scent the grilled tandoori chicken samples was just amazing the same  cuts of chicken cooked with  different spices one red one green one yellow green whatever the hell it was was nuts the mixed biryani following was also solid mouthwatering if you want a casual space easy attitude and scrumptious indian food take it for a spin\",\"delicious food the friendly waiter was patient with me while i stared at their enormous menu and decided on what to get i ordered the mutton kebab masala and chicken biryani both were incredibly flavorful and the meat in both were tender way better than most of the indian restaurants i have had in the u s my only regret is that i came along and i could not order as many dishes and i wanted\",\"was here for a wonderfully delicious early afternoon lunch upstairs in air conditioned comfortable dining room fantastic menu excellent service and great value highly recommend\",\"found this place via yelp i recommend to sit in the nd floor for air conditioning this restaurant has outstanding food and service the curry mutton was my favorite dish here the flavor was very rich creamy and extremely flavorful we also ordered other foods and they were also very very fantastic i definitely recommend this place if you are visiting singapore and want to find some delicious indian food but there is a  service charge on the bill\",\"you think it is a tourist trap or maybe it is but when the food is good i do not care this place is one of the many indian restaurants in little india it is not easy to stumble into the restaurants if you are not looking for it albeit the corner location however the food was lip smacking good we ordered the grilled fish the mushroom tandoori and the pakora starter and washed everything down with good old tiger shortly said i was happy with the food\",\"this place is in the heart of little india just a  minute walk off the mrt covered outdoor seating makes for a very comfortable experience the food is fantastic and reasonably priced although i would recommend a party of more than one lunch can be pricey if you want to try more than one dish not complaining at all however well worth the higher than usual lunch expense i cannot recommend this place more highly if you find yourself in singapore and you like fantastic indian cuisine do not skip this place\",\"deep breath tourist trap tourist trap true storyi ordered the koftas   pretty pricey but hey this place is meant to be good right dish arrived and i thought erm here is the sauce where are the koftas dig around with my fork found koftas two yes two looking at waiter erm there is only two koftas here waiter erm that is how we do it i will see if i can get some more returns with one kofta and cuts it it two i sh you not seriously people do yourself a favour walk around the back to around the house of tan tieng grab a masala milk for   a plate of chenna masala for   and enjoy the tranquility and food which is heaps better hey go crazy if you spend  you will get an absolute feast or feed the whole family\",\"the restaurant claims that it is possibly the best indian restaurant in singapore and this is very possibly true i ordered the curry mutton a low to medium spicy lamb dish full of flavor the meat was tender and the combination of spices very authentic i would avoid the fancier naans and opt for the plain naan instead the garlic naan was a bit drier than i had hoped for\",\"location this place is located in little india singapore when i came here around early mid april they were doing construction downstairs so it was not a place i would considered just by looking outside i came here through yelp and since i was around the area thought i will give it a try environment service i had to go upstairs since downstairs was constructing so i was told if you know singapore it gets pretty damn hot it was pretty hot upstairs and it was poorly ventilated it is a horrible experience when you are sweating so much yet trying to consume food it was pretty busy due to the area being a tourist friendly area but service was slow and waiters were not attentive their chairs are so heavy and huge which makes it so difficult to even get up to use the bathroom food i tried their chicken curry and their jumbo prawns the chicken curry was okay meat was too dry and was not really my type of curry i had indian food before and it was better their jumbo prawns did not look like prawns and rather more like regular shrimps it was also on the pricier side for mediocre food their menu is like a book a lot of choices but definitely overwhelming if i remembered correctly it was about  pages or more overall i give this place two stars two stars only because maybe other dishes on the menu could have tasted better but i would not know other than that service was not great it was too hot to even move and our food was not that great either\",\"not usually the biggest indian food lover but wow was this place awesome just happened to stubble upon the restaurant walking down little india everyone ordered something different and we all shared and loved it services super nice will come back best food in sin\",\"khansma delivers and it is oh so good chicken tikka samosas lassis tandoori chicken biryani rice all are so yummy love being able to call up and have this delivered to my place\",\"food was excellent service was great and the restaurant was clean recommend chicken tikka masala if you like real spicy and butter milk chocked if you like not so spicy and chicken curry no spicy and for beers kingfisher was awsome\",\"the world is first michelin hawker stall we always try to get to one michelin restaurant each year so why not stop here at the cheapest one i never thought i would pay under  usd for a michelin meal they have multiple locations but we wanted to go to the original one that was awarded inside of the chinatown food complex even though there is one right across the walkway in an air conditioned building we lined up right before they opened and we were still about th in line it took about  minutes to get to the front and order our food but they do have a good system in place to keep the line under control we chose the soy sauce chicken rice and roasted pork rice plates you can add extra sauce or spicy chili on the side once you get your meal the portion is pretty generous considering we only paid a whomping   sgd the chicken was so tender and the roasted pork had a perfectly crunchy outer skin and tender inner meat\",\"the cheapest michelin star meal in the world only   sg for their signature soya sauce chicken rice meal it is good filing and cheap what more can i say oh yes go early long lineups there we showed up before they opened at am and there was already a long loop around lineup you must try this\",\"delicious especially the chicken with noodles the noodles have absorbed the soy sauce which made the noodles more savoury chickens were smooth and tender i did not expect street food could have good quality of food there was a long line up so if interested please go early to avoid long line ups\",\"liao fan hawker chan is arguably the most hyped food stall on the planet and i found that especially after waiting a solid forty minutes in line that the execution did not quite add up to the hype especially given there is such strong competition in the area star  how were the service and atmosphere i am told the lines at hawker chan can easily exceed an hour so i will consider myself lucky that on a saturday at lunch i only waited forty minutes once you are front and center the woman working the counter is especially sweet and you will have you dishes in only a few minutes star star  how were the portions relative to the cost unable to decide between the flagship soy chicken rice and the char siew noodle i opted for both which combined were only about  sgd that is insanely cheap and some of the best value you l find anywhere in the world star stars  and  how was the food honestly both these dishes were just okay and i was surprised to find that i like the char siew much better than i did the chicken rice even if you do not get a full or have chicken the chicken rice is more or less bone in which necessitates quite a bit of work while eating from there the white rice was just okay the char siew was much better but even those noodles fell a bit short single star star  would you be excited to go back there are simply too many amazing food stalls for me to recommend the wait for hawker chan no star\",\"liao fan hawker chan i salute you for serving the most affordable michelin star meal on the planet i came here during brunch hours and the line was not too crazy there were probably twenty people ahead and the wait was less than half an hour what i ordered soya chicken so delicious this is the real deal that sweet soy sauce flavor smothered on the chicken as well as on the rice makes you want to have wings and fly the egg and the cucumber served on the side also complements the taste from being boring best of all the price is unmatched with any other cuisines in the city for only  singaporean dollars this place is worth the trip\",\"biggest disappointment we arrived at the original location to find a line of only about  people score we ordered both the chicken and rice and chicken and noddles  total you could not go wrong but it did my first couple of bites were loaded with tiny bones the flavors were lacking after adding hot sauce the meal because slightly bearable but this was one of the worst meals we have had on our trip to date one we were the most excited about looking back a majority of the reviews and articles of this hawker dated back to   maybe they are past their prime or the new ownership name changed things up on the flip side my husband is chicken was tender and mostly bone free however significantly lacking flavor note we arrived around   an hour before they were closing not as if that should of impacted anything\",\"i am sure this hawker stall use to be an amazing local gem in its prime days signs of a red flag when the signage says formerly liao fan and the original owner is not there working the stalls is when you know something has probably changed i thought the food was just okay your typical hong kong bbq food no different than something you would get at sam woo back in the states i decided to wait in line because there was a short line of about   people but the pace of the line moved like snails took roughly about  mins to get my plate of soya sauce rice with added roasted pork all in all nothing to rave home about i would not recommend anyone to wait in line even for the curious foody just pick another hawker stall with a small line in front of it and i am sure you will get the same type of hk bbq\",\"well i would say my family agrees it is well deserved and true to it is reputation it is a rare one star michelin rated   dining icon we had a whole soy sauce chicken noodles with cha sil  sides of rice wow but wow za super tenter and tasty chicken cha sil was good but a tiny portion rice was fine prices here were higher than at the original hawker stall however yesterday was sunday and the stall was closed we have dined at the stall before and with it is lower prices and open air hot humid atmosphere it is discounted accordingly why  stars are you joking nope it is fabulous\",\"what in tarnation these were the only three words that rang through my head as i sank my teeth into the food at liao fan hawker chan i was in disbelief an incredibly excellent michelin starred meal that cost what seemed like mere pennies and peanuts the hype here is real unbelievably succulent meats and flavor packed carbohydrates at ungodly prices i ordered the soya sauce chicken rice and the roasted pork noodle and my taste buds still have not returned from their vacation to deliciousville what in tarnation what in tarnation\",\"when i came to singapore i knew i had to stop by the world is cheapest  michelin star restaurant we got to the chinatown complex around  am but the stall did not open until  am then i found out that they opened an actual storefront across the street while yelp lists that that one opens at am it actually also opens at   wanting to eat at the og location we went back into the chinatown complex and waited on the line for the stall to open we were about  on the line and we showed up about  min before opening by the time she opened the shop there were about  people waiting on the line once opened the line moved fairly quickly and surprisingly orderly they menu was pretty limited you could order soy sauce chicken their speciality and claim to their michelin star roasted pork and bbq pork there may have been other items but i only saw those three on this day you can get them by themselves or with rice or egg noodles a plate of chicken or pork over rice or noodles is   singaporean dollar dirt cheap half a soy sauce chicken is  and whole is  we ordered half a chicken and char siew pork over rice the chicken was really really good the seasoning was delicious not too salty or too sweet just the right amount of spices it was also super tender next we tried the char siew pork we thought the pork looked burnt but wanted to try it anyway and oh my god are we glad that we did the char siew pork was the best char siew pork either one of us have ever eaten the outer crust had a slightly charred caramelized layer that is crunchy when you bite down the middle consists of a perfect balance of lean to fats to add tenderness and flavor we were blown away by how good it was i think the real star is the char siew pork and if i had to choose one i would pick the char siew pork over the soy sauce chicken the following day we went back to try the store front location the storefront prices are double what the hawker stall prices are one plate of chicken pork with rice or noodles is about  still a huge bargain for a michelin starred restaurant but the prices are different and i thought i should mention it i presume the higher prices go toward the higher cost of rent for this larger location and also ac and more staff i ordered the char siew pork over noodles this time and skipped the chicken the portions appear slightly larger than the one we received from the hawker stall but still not a huge portion the char siew was also not as good as the one we had across the street the day before it was not as charred or caramelized it was good but not mind blowing if you have a chance to visit here i would highly recommend eating at their original hawker stall over the newer restaurant\",\"the cheapest michelin star worldwide note that one restaurant in the food center is closed on mondays so you can expect a slightly longer line on mondays the total wait until you get your food is around  minutes rice with roasted chickenthe chicken is really tasty and for s  you literally pay nothing for it but do not be fooled the portion of the chicken is so little that it is more snack than a meal therefore i recommend to go with the half chicken it is a better value and the chicken tastes better as they cut it differentlyhalf roasted chicken just get this one dcoconut water for s   you cant go wrong super tasty and sweet better than those in hawker centervegetables nothing special if you feel guilty of having too much meat this might be an option otherwise skip itpapaya soup this is a dream for fobi local chinese people but was nothing for me german american asian this is more something my parents would probably enjoy d\",\"perhaps the cheapest michelin starred meal you can get anywhere a plate of soy sauce chicken over noodles at hawker chan located in a chinatown hawker center costs just   the lines for this place can be massive and we had to wait about  minutes on a saturday morning the chicken here comes with a delicious savory sauce kind of like sa cha and you can add on a chili dipping sauce for a bit of spice we also tried the char siu or chinese barbecue pork which was lean sweet and savory the bed of white rice made for a perfect medium to soak up the sauce and the beans on the side added some nice texture was it worth the price definitely but i cannot say that i would necessarily wait again in line just to have this a second time\",\"stumbled upon hawker chan after doing some research on food spots in singapore overall its not the typical hawker stall experience as it is in a building and well kept in terms of food i got the standard soya sauce chicken and tofu appetizer the chicken was delicious i live in chinatown ny and definitely cannot get better chicken there than in singapore the skin on the chicken just has this texture that is unbelievable oily and slippery yet hearty and firm the chicken was delicious highly highly recommend this joint mmmm sogoooo\",\"now this might be the most famous hawker stall in singapore it was definitely on my list of must try eating well before we went there maybe the fame has as much to do with the fact that the soya chicken and rice is only slightly more than   a plate and there is a half hour line to get it it was yummy of course but i think i actually liked hainanese chicken rice better never the less this place is an icon and worth the trip we also had the char siew with rice and i think i liked it better you really cannot go wrong here that is for sure\",\"cheapest michelin star in the world this serves hk style roast chicken and rice the soy sauce chicken is juicy and tender but is it thattt good i do not think so definitely above average but not particularly standout the rice is just ok as well although not as famous as the soy sauce chicken they serve pretty good barbecue pork with noodle here would recommend getting a set with both chicken and bbq pork so you can try bothnear the original stall in chinatown they now open an air conditioned restaurant nearby\",\"i guess i understand why this place was awarded its michelin star the food is genuinely delicious for a hawker stand it is extraordinary but at the end of the day it is still hawker stand food it is simple no frills and served up with plastic utensils i think the general consensus is that the food would be more impressive if there was not any preconception associated with the michelin star but i doubt the owner is complaining\",\"as a starter we wanted to visit the original hawker stall which is literally across the street from the store front but the entire complex is undergoing renovation until june st i can only speak on the storefront it is not lost on me or i assume anyone else that i waited in the line with that we were all here for the same experience critically acclaimed cheap food through a bunch of youtube news outlet click spirals i discovered this place am glad to have had the opportunity to try the food here the mechanics we got here around  to discover the  smith street complex was undergoing renovation until june st went to the storefront and the line extended to the door but luckily not outside you get your receipt with a number and there are a few tv screens that list your order number and when it is ready the restaurant takes credit card we ordered  dishes the awarded hong kong soya sauce chicken the pork char siu siew hk soya sauce chicken very very good the meat was mostly tender and the sauce was a right combo of savory and sweet a few pieces were a touch dry but all in all for sgd   it is worth going to for this alone and waiting there might be better there might be worse but at least i have a good base to compare other versions of this dish my one regret is not ordering the half chicken but perhaps on another visitpork char siew holllllllllyyyyyyyyyyy hellllllll yo this was bomb com gov edu the char siew was tender with the great ratio of meat fat and caramelization of the outside if the one at the og stall is even better i do not know if i can handle it noodles my goodness so good some of the better noodles i had they enhanced the proteins we ordered good by itself good in the sauce it was in good with any combo of items i put in there in short this entire bill was less than   usd for an experience that i hope to repeat in the future a michelin star increases the focus on this restaurant and i get the immediate sense that the expectations on this place are heightened it is cheap it is very tasty and if there are better versions of these items at another place or just better at this location i hope to try it sometime soon\",\"reposting my review here from the previous yelp page that now says closed despite it only having a name change this review is for the actual liao fan hong kong food stall now known as hawker chan instead of the hawker chan restaurant which opened after the michelin star was earned yelp is a bit confusing in that reviewers are posting reviews for both locations on multiple businesses which all have different addresses the food stall is located on the second floor of the chinatown complex which is across the street from the air conditioned sit down restaurant the reason i chose to eat at the stall is because the prices are cheaper and the food is supposedly better also if i am going to come all the way here it is better to eat at the original right especially since hawker chain restaurant chains are now popping up all over the world the soya sauce chicken noodle is the dish that earned this place a michelin star at the stall it is s   super cheap for a michelin star meal i also ordered a char siew rice which was also   there are some other menu items that also looked delicious like the soya sauce chicken rice roasted pork rice and the chicken hor fun most dishes are s  and under let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good the chicken was very tender and juicy the noodles were cooked well i love that they poured their delicious sauces all over my plate was it amazing i am not sure there are a lot of other stalls in the area serving the same exact dish and most of them are also really delicious i am not sure what makes the chicken stand out the char siew however was really good i liked it more than the chicken overall i think my expectations were too high because of this place is popularity and its star the only reason we came here was to try the cheapest michelin star meal in the world i am not sure if i would come here again and wait in the really long line comparing this place to other one michelin star restaurants i would give it a four star good food at a very cheap price comparing this place to other hawker stalls i would give it a five star\",\"soya chicken rice is very delicious and for the price of   usd sgd it makes it even better although this is comparable to some of the chicken rice spots you can obtain at hawker stalls the building that provides a number of amenities such as bathroom and napkins makes eating here much more enjoyable lines are not terrible and everyone is here to get the world is cheapest michelin star restaurant well worth the visit i would every time i am back in singapore\",\"for quite the long line i came as it was just opening on a weekday and the line was already quite long and the fact that this place has a michelin star i was expecting so much more i had the chicken and rice and honestly the only good part about it was the chicken and even that i felt was lacking the chicken itself was cooked really well and i thought it was roasted quite nicely unfortunately that is where the benefits end the seasoning was quite mediocre it tasted a little bland in some place the rice was terrible and low quality tasting the sauces and accompaniments taste like the typical items you can get from any other average hawker stand the good part though is that the price was super low at around  a plate it was a steal but unfortunately a low price does not justify the wait and i guess my expectations coming in were too high because of the michelin star\",\"absolutely insane cocktails kind of expensive th stunning views but great ambiance music is popping later best at sundowners menu is not super loaded  great for short lunch rendezvous\",\"we went here for drinks and they have super sweet cocktails we ordered  and could not finish half of any of them on the other hand the drinks are huge other then that we had a great view of the gardens from our table\",\"one of the best views of the city without a doubt was here for a company happy hour event they have a minimum spend for large groups but the host was gracious enough to accomodate us even otherwise drinks are nice and strong and they have some excellent canaps as well service is great as well its right next to the infamous infinity pool though that is for guests only it is expensive though given the location and the view the cost is worth it\",\"wonderful lunch spot with the incredible th floor views of singapore and the bay our reservation timed perfectly with a thunderstorm so we got to watch the clouds roll in we enjoyed the grilled organic chicken club brioche apple wood smoked bacon avocado sunny side up egg comt cheese herb aioli super soft bread and tons of veggies and the bincho grilled salmon salad hijiki seaweed rice korean banchan gochujang sesame chilithe salmon fell apart as soon as my fork touched it perfectly buttery and light the array of types of salads beneath the salmon was really neat to experiment with i paired with the wolfgang puck chardonnay and could not have been happier\",\"to be honest we came here to eat just because of the view and being californians it seemed very appropriate naturally this restaurant will be everything you expected to be incredible service incredible food and a view that rivals every other view\",\"view is amazing this bar is next to the infamous infinity pool so if you cannot afford a night in the hotel and still was to see the pool this is going to be your best option i absolutely loved the view menu prices are decent for being what it is and where it is for singapore the prices are pretty average i recommend coming to this spot highly if you are unable to stay a night at this hotel\",\"had an amazing lunch at spago beautiful views of the gardens by the bay from the top of marina bay sands excellent food and service a remarkable price  sgd per person for three courses the portions are also very generous it is amazing to go to such a high end restaurant and not leave hungry unequivocally recommend this place appetizers pt de campagne delicious and a large portionbig eye tuna tartare cones two small delicious one bite conesmains grilled chicken cobb salad perfect execution on this classicsteamed japanese sea bream large portion good flavor beautiful presentationdessert pistachio panna cotta one of the best desserts i have had all year\",\"the view is great from up here this is a better alternative to queuing up for the sky park\",\"being at the top of the boat at the top of the sands in the hottest spot in singapore is enough reason to go the bartender is amazing the scene would make anyone envious and watching people swim in the infinity pool at the top of the world is about as perfect a view as there is but then the food a very expensive burger as you would expect with the ideal brioche bun and seasonings reflective of the region and fries crispy on the outside soft in the middle the only thing keeping it from five stars was that i was emphatic about a medium rare burger they acted as though i was crazy for ordering it and then served it well done bot a glimmer of pink oh well totally worth it anyway\",\"second night in a row here the drinks are fantastic the view of the skyline is beautiful and the halo halo dessert is heavenly i had halo halo several times in the philippines but i actually preferred this version over what i have had in the home that originated the unique cultural dessert definitely suggest trying it\",\"fantastic meal high up on top of marina bay sands sat by the window which was nice for seeing the tree light show below fyi shows are at   and   pm had both an appetizer white asparagus and main dish lamb there is a good wine list to complement the food a selection of breads with both salted and unsalted butter was delicious we did not order desert but they provided a very nice anniversary plate to celebrate our special occasion\",\"a big thank you to the staff spagosingapore we wanted to end our last night in singapore with a special dinner so spago was a great choice spago is located on the top floor of marina bay sands and the view is breathtaking the staff made us feel so special the love and hospitality was amazing we will be back soon thank you to the managers who came out to talk to us and even brought our main course out starter   big eye tuna tartare cones complimentary from the chef   pumpkin brown butter dumplings main   honey miso broiled black cod   dutch milk fed veal chop desert   calamansi vanilla vacherin\",\"amazing food was superb every small plate was absolutely delicious and perfect the staff were very attentive without being in your way tables are spaced a reasonable distance apart cocktails were tasty but the views from the th floor open air with infinity pool in front of you degree views that are dazzling the garden by the bay the city skyline the cargo ships lined up like an old painting in a museum words do not do it justice it was expensive but oh so worth it\",\"best place to chill in evenings and try some food and cocktails together there are hidden cocktails which you can order only if you have been there i would not revel the secret as it is really amazing to order those exclusive cocktails not in the menu the staff is very friendly and best time to go is between  pm when there is easy availability of seats to relax and enjoy the evening price is on higher side for every dish compared to normalplaces due to its location and view of the entire city\",\"happy hour    beers  to choose  drinks  to choose   wines  to choose l appetizers grilled cheese yum fried chicken bites yum spring roll yum salmon no idea glynn the manager is welcoming and is interested in those spending time effort and money to be here it is truly refreshing to see a manager staff restaurant get that the simplest welcoming and earnest hello from staff brings out wallets and creates instant customer retention the whole staff and experience is welcoming this is a busy very high end restaurant it is not cheap those coming here expect to be delivered the best service and expect to pay for the service and ambiance too this place does not disappoint makes me really happy and it is my number one recommendation in singapore level  is my second\",\"you think spago is beyond over and it is this dusty relic from the past but i was so happy with my experience unbeatable location with views of the crazy mbs pool and the surrounding city lovely ambiance and very spacious inside too excellent service attentive and friendly drinks in singapore are so pricey especially at and around mbs and given those circumstances they have one of the best happy hours the drinks are delicious and so is the food i could come here everyday for a drink some spring rolls and chicken karaage and be happy seriously though i am a seasoned international drinker and the cocktails here and the other wolfgang puck restaurant cut are some of the best i have ever had\",\"perched atop the famous marina bay sands is spago a wolfgang puck restaurant that has locations around the world my personal favorite is the beverly hills location but the singapore location has the best views by far i went for lunch and made a pm reservation in hopes of dodging the suits that were sure to fill the dining area later in the afternoon getting to the top of mbs is always an adventure and i got lost as i took the wrong elevator in tower  which only took me to the nd floor but eventually made it to the top after three elevator transfers the proposed route involves two elevator transfers so keep an eye out for the lifts that take you up to the th floor in tower  and then take a second lift up to the th floor upon arriving you will see the spago bar and lounge to your right and the fine dining area to your left straight ahead you will see glimpses of the mouth dropping view through the welcome area the fine dining area has a dress code of business casual and i saw many people turned away for wearing flip flops or swim gear the restaurant shares a roof with an infinity pool so i put on a decent dress with slip on sneakers it seemed to work just fine and i was seated promptly by the window which overlooks the water where you can watch the ships hang out just past the gardens by the bay the staff were so nice and did not seem to mind me a lone blogger taking a table all to myself the interior of the dining room is gorgeous with white table cloths and a beautiful orchid center piece it honestly seemed a lot classier than the beverly hills spago and way classier than the las vegas spago which i think shut down good riddance i was presented with a very luxe a la carte menu for lunch but opted to go with the express prix fixe  courses for  the express lunch is quite the deal as i recently paid  just for one singapore sling i also got my favorite cocktail peace on earth for an extra  i originally ordered the tuna cones but they already had one made for me so i swapped out my first course for the chicken laksa spring roll per the recommendation of the staff this appetizer is unique to the singapore spago and i am really glad i made the swap i was not sure i wanted anything fried but the spring rolls were cooked to perfection and filled with a warm asian flavors with a thicker curry texture there is a delicious coconut flavor that lingered with each bite i did not see coconut listed as part of the dish so perhaps i imagined it whatever it was it was great i enjoyed the tuna cone but it paled in comparison to the spring rolls next i got the steamed red snapper it looked absolutely stunning the fish was cooked well and the garnish tasted of a light soy sauce and was enjoyable on its own it is served with a side of rice which was tasty i tested the sauce that was on the side but i was not a fan so i skipped it i will say that the flavors of the dish while delicious were clearly on or around the fish if you are looking for a fish with deep flavors infused into every bite you wont get it with this snapper however if you are like me and you appreciate the natural taste of fish it is pretty good finally it was time for dessert each express lunch comes with a pistachio panna cotta on a hot day this dessert is truly refreshing with orange flavors all over the panna cotta there is a lot going on on top of the actual dessert candied this and that but the orange gelato was fantastic and the panna cotta itself ignoring the pistachio brittle and other toppings was divine the quality of food decor and service at spago never disappoints except in vegas and i would highly recommend going to spago for a business lunch or a special occasion if you only plan to go to singapore once definitely go to spago for either dinner or just head to the lounge if you come to singapore often it is not a must unless you are in the mood for stunning views paired with delicious views i will probably be back at some point total cost  th floor of marina bay sands tower singaporethis is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews\",\"i have taken quite a few visiting friends to ce la vi however i never really liked it service is very average and f b offerings are generally disappointing but obviously you are there for the amazing view why no one ever told me before that there is a much better alternative is a puzzle to me spago bar lounge is simply awesome the view is in my opinion even better than clv you can see the whole of marina bay plus you get to see the well known mbs infinity pool the service is on point from the person picking up the phone over the hostess to the waiters all were really helpful and pro active the food is amazing who would have thought that a tourist trap such as the mbs rooftop serves on of the best burgers in singapore and the tuna tartare cones are to die for the drinks are really great i am known to be quite picky on my cocktails both the hot legs and grin n bare it were fantastic the only downside is that they do not serve ranch dressing to go with their otherwise delicious burger and fries i honestly cannot wait to try the other snacks of the bar menu and their full restaurant menu so i can tell you you wo not see me again at ce la vi anytime soon unless calvin harris preferably doused in ranch comes and invites me personally\",\"the top of this sands is an unbelievable setting and an amazing view there is no question about that the restaurant is lovely and has gone out of its way to make sure that most all tables have amazing views that is reason enough to come have a meal here i recommend coming during the day as the view of downtown singapore is great during the day and there is some amusing people watching at the rooftop pool right next to the restaurant that being said the restaurant is quite good and manages to avoid the typical pitfall of the scenic view restaurant nice house too bad no one is home the food was excellent and definitely approachable for the tourist crowd without being boring no small accomplishment dumplings kblt and soft omelet were all delicious kblt was really really good only two issues with the place the tuna tartare cones were off and we sent them back they did come right off the bill so all good there the second is the typical for singapore disinterested level of service we had several long awkward service gaps which required us to flag down our often absent waiter we had to ask for more water etc it was a non stop cavalcade of flagging down wait staff to handle things which should have been handled while annoying this is what i have come to expect in singapore so i only get mildly annoyed now that my expectations have been beaten into shape\",\"the view is beautiful as hell the food and drinks are extraordinary the price is not too expensive for the test beauty and enjoyment you get\",\"a sophisticated speakeasy style bar while unmarked from the outside if you are here during opening hours make your way right in and you will be greeted by a friendly hostess and also by friendly staff there is a ginormous menu of cocktails arranged broadly by flavor profiles fresh bold tropical among others all drinks are priced at s  us   but are worth it given the quality and detail that go into each one the diplomatic immunity diplomatico planas rum lime ginger aperol hopped grapefruit jamaican funk and button masher plantation original dark rum peanut butter px sherry raspberry single malt were both solid better yet there is quite a solid food menu here i went with something on the smaller side the yummy truffled mac n cheese balls but there are larger offerings like the burger cubano and chicken tenders to help you soak up all that booze service is courteous and professional here not least from a friendly manager originally from nyc whom i chatted with and the venue itself is worth the visit modern sexy and gorgeous a great find thanks to all you yelpers out there\",\"was desperately looking for signs of life around town during chinese new year so glad this place was open and was able to spend a nice relaxing evening here going through  rounds of joy lucas was a solid performer the whole night out the favorite of the night was definitely the green park coming from the american bar in london i honestly could actually just drink that one thing all night next time the hint of basil and celery made the the drink so refreshing and light also got some truffle mac croquettes to munch on that were pretty good ambiance at this place was pretty good nothing too loud or rowdy was able to have a nice conversation with some of the other people i met there special shout out to fellow yelper joelle for putting up with me most of the night and for the tips on some of the other bars in the area\",\"fabulous cocktails almost speak easy like gets packed real quick and limited seating more on the dark and intimate side\",\"recently when i was still in hk my texas mates were partying hard in sg and obviously soused when they finally hit yet another bar which they described as bespoke and somewhere along hong kong street the next thing they knew was me back in sg and us filled with seafood goodness from jb ah meng and sipping whisky at the single cask one of them lost his wallet the night before and was obviously pretty depressed as all his usd and cards were in there so we tried to rewind his memory to narrow down where he could have misplaced it after much detective work we decided that it could have been that very bespoke bar along hong kong street which they thought was number  i immediately corrected them and told them the bar they were at that fateful night before has to be none other than  hong kong street a hail mary phone call was made by him to  hong kong street and lo and behold they have his wallet we quickly bottoms up our whisky and rushed over when we got here they were all ready to return his wallet much to the elation of my buddy and he quickly gave them a big tip we then proceeded to grab more whisky at the bar before settling down when seats became available the nikka never tasted so good to my friend and he obviously got the tab for it thank you all his money and cards were intact and he just could not believe it only in sg he proclaimed the staff here also proceeded to serve us a free round of shots how awesome is that only in  hong kong street we proclaimed so if you ever feel like losing your wallet\",\"unexpected visit to this place as it was not on my agenda nor radar i wanted to visit other bars that have emerged since i last visited singapore i made an impromptu stop and ended up staying here for a few hours i even ended up running into a bartender from my absolute favorite bar here in singapore at this place drinks remained pretty amazing bartenders extremely accommodating all i can say is oh what a night\",\"chanced by this place after dinner at clarke quay we were there fairly early about h and it was already quite crowded drinks were good and tasty but the thing i loved most was that they were willing to customize drinks based on what we liked my husband wanted an umami drink and they delivered service staff were nice and attentive cool place to unwind after a long day at work will definitely be back for their mac and cheese balls\",\"how do you get the kids to eat brussel sprouts just add bacon this is one of hk  is tasty morsels and along with the mac n cheese balls which are a superb twist on an arancini ball they have got some of the best bar snacks going hk  is the quintessential hidden bar unassuming doorway in the middle of unassuming street and like many cocktail bars from the street is namesake city there are heavy japanese influences in the meticulous mixing attention to detail staff and delicious drinks there is a huge number of spirits on display and the staff are energetic and ready to deliver an experience that you will remember no matter how many drinks you have beware they make them boozy here so if you are a lightweight you could be stumbling after   drinks prices are also at the high end however you are in one of the top  bars in asia so that is understandable if you are a seasoned campaigner then i recommend going off menu as where hk really shines is when you challenge the staff to create something new\",\"after witnessing some of the craziness of clarke quay the night before my friend decided to take me here as a change of scenery and also so i could experience a place that was awarded the best bar in asia i am glad she did because i love speakeasy is and i also appreciate well made cocktails the entrance to the bar was both kind of cool and a bit obvious that it was a speakeasy luckily the day we went it was not too full so we could actually talk to each other as well as chat up the interesting bartenders here seriously the man making my drinks dropped some life knowledge on me that night most importantly the cocktails are extremely well made and also quite creative i ordered some type of play on an old fashioned and it was probably one of the best i have ever had in my life i am not the biggest fan of french  is but i nearly drank all of my friend is because it was that good too we also had their version of a manhattan and some gin berry drink but those drinks could not compare to our first two everything was going great until the bar started to turn up the music way too loud i am fine with creating a fun atmosphere with music but this was pretty excessive we were going to order one more round of drinks but decided to head somewhere else because we could not hear anything other than the music hks you were so close to perfection\",\"came here in oct  while visiting singapore their truffle mac cheese balls were delicious each of the cocktails we tried were great as well only complaint was that the lighting was very dark might not have minded as much if it were just a bar or if we were just drinking but would have preferred a bit more light as we were eating i would definitely go back\",\"greeted at the door by a circus freak looking woman with rods sticking out of her face and tattooed head to toe the bar was wall to wall guys very slow service i left after  minutesdo not waste your time here\",\"for asia is  best bars  for a reasonservice was unreal had such a great time i will be back\",\"excellent speakeasy bar it is really not that hard to find the place gets pretty packed on the weekend but it is worth checking out the drinks are new york city priced but they are pretty great the bartenders are friendly and it is worth sitting at the counter just to chat them up the food is nothing to write home about\",\"i am not huge into writing reviews in general but i had to say something about hks i came with my girlfriend and some of her friends here one night we were excited to check out all the hype over  hong kong st seeing that it is  for asia is  best bars for  we come from nyc and are pretty use to checking out speakeasies we came away from this one disappointed it is highly overrated they need to approach more seriously their service quality control service here is lackluster we came in around  pm on a weekday expecting it to be likely popping eventually but in a speakeasy sense it started off alright the vibe in here was what exactly we were looking for cool interior understated entrance etc but soon during our visit servers became inattentive and kept forgetting simple requests from us like providing cutlery for the food we had ordered or refilling our water at several points we wanted to order and try out some more drinks we eventually gave up it took way too long to get a server is attention and then wait on the drinks food to be served it seemed as if half the time they almost were avoiding our attempts to get their attention drinks were creatively named and were interesting concoctions but it would have been nice if the servers were helpful in recommending suggesting instead of straight up impatiently waiting on us to choose and order our drinks an hour or so in during our visit they also upped the music volume and turned up the bass i am not a stickler for music volume i am a fan of lounge music but the bass was uncomfortably strong for a speakeasy there were also large standing crowds around the bar it got clubby in this so called speakeasy bar it devalued the whole experience the music and bass standing people situation made it difficult to enjoy the drinks we ordered and speak among ourselves had a below average experience i do not mind spending more on good service atmosphere and drinks but  hong kong street did not deliver great service or the appropriate atmosphere and because of this this made the drinks we had taste below average for the price we paid and given  hks reputation\",\"craft cocktails done well with local flairhighlights big cocktail menu local julep with some tropical flavors long bar and tables along the side classy dark atmospherelowlights close kitchen early no late night snacks and eats unmarked door so have to know where you are goingcool spot that was a bit sf but a nice break from the touristy rowdy circle quay\",\"nothing adds more allure to a place than making it exclusive like most speakeasies this bar is discrete and only has a small plaque by the door for identification want in on a weekend you best have a reservation luckily we did we enjoyed a few creatively named cocktails and some appetizers while taking in the atmosphere of a s bar including a few bartenders dressed according to the time period the crimson and clover gin cocktail was excellent and the others ordered looked great as well nothing makes a girl living the paleo lifestyle happier than veggie chips and brussels sprouts with bacon accompanied by good conversation i could have spent hours here heads up on the bathroom sinks they are run by pedals on the floor i looked like a fool waving my hands around under two different faucets before having an employee giggle at me and advise definitely worth the visit\",\"hong kong street was awesome there is a cool hidden entry so you just need to know where it is since it looks like nothing is really there when we got there is was standing room only since we were only staying for a drink we did not mind and we got lucky right after we order our drinks a few seat at the bar opened up it is very small and dark inside but loved the dcor the bartenders were awesome we chatted with yoma for a little and he did a great job on our drinks drinks in singapore are defiantly pricey but at least here at  hong kong street you are getting a good drink and not something overpriced and watery if you are looking for a good cocktail this is the place to hit up\",\"fun bar good drinks and music a bit trendy and kind of packed a bit annoyed that they have not had the wheels of steel for two weeks and an about to stop going back to find out if they have it or not\",\"i love hks for a lot of reasons and have little to add that has not been covered in the other reviews this place is no longer a secret you just tell the taxi driver hong kong street and he already knows exactly where to stop they have recently remodeled the interior cozier curved banquet seats in place of the long straight one more communal round tables in place of the rectangular ones and upholstered poofs in place of the chairs the lighting is now even more dim each of the round tables has a downlight that lights just the table the bar and bar back with an impressive display of spirits is now larger a big thumbs up for all of these very thoughtful and effective improvements the signature drinks are each very delicious in their own distinct and unique way even with the help of the staff sometimes it is a bit of trial and error finding the perfect one that suits your taste part of the fun is sampling these thoughtfully crafted drinks but do not hesitate to toss the menu aside and order your favorite classic cocktail half way through the evening i switched from drinking the hulk smash a refreshing sweet lemony gin concoction served with an excessive amount of ice to a simple well prepared gin tonic served in a tall glass with cucumber i could not have been happier with it the gourmet bar comfort food is good there are many delicious offerings besides the truffle mac cheese balls but honestly if you do not order those you should just stay at home the good what is not to love maybe the bill at the end is a bit of a downer the food and drinks are not cheap but chances are you will be too happy to care the bad all of the thoughtful improvements have really enhanced the overall guest experience it is a more intimate and communal evening gathered around the small round tables chances are you wo not take much notice of anyone outside of those gathered at your table unfortunately last night we sat in the front corner table and all agreed that the music blaring from the overhead speaker above us made it difficult to hear each other we were having to shout a little they should consider either lowering the volume or repositioning the speakers to eliminate this problem the verdict  hong kong street is a great place to meet friends for drinks make reservations in advance to get a good table arrive hungry and thirsty both the food and drinks are addictive   stars\",\"i always love popping into this place after having dinner the drinks are always a surprise and the staff have always been very nice to me whenever i come the bartenders are immensely creative and know their craft no pun intended this place is a keeper in my book\",\"thankfully i had done enough research to know how to find this place because there are no windows and no signage aside from the  outside as you walk in you enter a curtained off area with a hostess at the end she then leads you through the curtain into the beautiful bar that is  hong kong street a wonderfully dark lit speakeasy type bar where the music is at a perfect level and the staff is happy to greet you i went by myself on a monday night and it was not too busy so i was able to sit at the bar and chat with the bartender the ambience is fantastic and the drinks were fantastic the only reason for not giving it  stars was that i did not try the food but rest assured i will be back oh yes i will certainly be back edit went back and had the burger absolutely fantastic best burger i have had in singapore i also tried the jimi and joni cocktail if you like no nonsense strong yet easy to drink cocktails i highly recommend the j j it was perfect now i feel comfortable giving a solid  stars\",\"foc describes itself as a fun and relaxed spanish restaurant with its roots in the catalonian region precisely barcelona it features exquisite tapas and dishes that will leave you craving for more if you want to be close to the action and witness how every dishes are carefully executed i suggest to take a seat at the bar we ordered sauted cauliflower with pine nuts the octopus galician style and the scallop soy caviar my personal favourite was the cauliflower but all the dishes were definitely satisfying to the palate and quite flavourful we also ordered two specials the suckling pig and the tuna salad again delightful one item we observed being prepared several times and had our attention was the squid ink paella maybe next time enjoy\",\"went here for dinner last friday excellent tapas place almost all the dishes we had were great especially the patatas bravas and the shrimp in ajillo sauce as well as the iberico ham with scrambled eggs the flaming rum baba was innovative too the only thing that missed the mark were the peppers with salt they were just way too bitter probably should not have ordered them solid   stars overall\",\"very good spanish tapas place we particularly like the more classic tapas items like garlic shrimp and croquette other dishes e g roasted chicken cauliflower tapas etc are standard good extensive wine selection and good desserts modern lively ambience and decent service a good place to check out for spanish tapas in singapore\",\"say what catalan cuisine in singapore my life is now complete beautiful plates of tapas and expertly crafted cocktails croquettes croquettes croquettes order dozens the patatas bravas are a favorite of mine these were average cod balls are yet another favorite and these did not disappoint the spanish octopus was perfectly prepared tender three words squid ink paella do it briny sea worthy delight the ambiance is plush rhythmic and romantic\",\"very good night out great food great service my favorite tonight simply the pane con tomato and ibetico ham the beautifully cooked scallops and the lemon tarte we will be back for sure very solid place\",\"was not too bad or too good because it is popular you have a time limit to eat your meal we tried  dishes and the one that really hit the mark was the scallop you f you are a penny pincher then do not go if you eat slow then do not go if you enjoy good food and cocktails then it is a must the photo shows squid ink paella nice taste would order again\",\"excellent food and service we are all small tapas and took their recommendations the atmosphere is great too little pricey and you probably need reservations but worth it\",\"wanted to add to the reviews as this is now one of the two best restaurants i have been to in singapore hidden away on a not so great street this place is a gem the food was amazing cocktails looked great although i had delicious wine and it was a great ambiance i would highly recommend this place\",\"who would have thunk it catalan cuisine in singapore my life is now repleat with fullness they serve expertly crafted cocktails and beautiful plates of tapas croquettes croquettes croquettes order scores the patatas bravas are a favorite of mine these were just ok cod balls are yet another favorite and these do not disappoint the spanish octopus was tender and perfectly prepared three words squid ink paella do it briny sea worthy delight the ambiance is rhythmic romantic and plush\",\"reliably excellent and always crowded have been here multiple times and i would recommend the staples gambas al ajillos croquettas jamon iberico octopus and any of the paellas cocktails are reasonably priced and the wine list has a good variety of spanish wines excellent service as well overall this is probably the best place for tapas in singapore\",\"not sure i was too happy to pay  for four pieces of bread but other than that the squid ink paella had robust flavors and would come back just for more of that\",\"this place has a real nyc vibe for restaurants great tapas spot with food from spain the chef is a michelin star chef and his food was legit staff was really nice like everyone in singapore usually is we ordered the lamb chops beef sliders cod fish balls some mushroom dish and i forgot the last item but everything was legit and tasted good would def come here again i would suggest to def make a reservation they book up quick as it is a trendy spot peace from doctor p\",\"this spanish tapas bar is on point the food is fantastic i wish i could have ordered the entire menu the jamon iberico ham was out of this world the cocktails were fun and delicious\",\"i get the hype this place is buzzy even on mondays with quirky decor great music and top notch food the cocktail menu does not seem to end and i love how they break it down by easily identifiable flavour profiles like refreshing floral and spirit driven i tried the lord sidecar loved the sage and it was a great starter for a hot and humid day i was surprised at the patatas bravas their rendition had a saucy kick to it the grilled foie gras sliders were very rich definitely a treat meant to be filed under sometimes food only my husband and i were also impressed with the black mediterranean squid ink paella a mouthful to say but when that mouthful is in your mouth it is damn shiok my only constructive feedback was that it was slightly warm where we were sitting we were at the end table opposite the bar kitchen i noticed we were not that far from the ceiling ac unit not sure if it was on at all\",\"we went here saturday night at about pm the restaurant was busy and the tunes were bumpin seriously i was chair dancing the whole night we went with tapas let is be honest when given the choice why would you not and loved everything we did the ham croquettes beef cheek sliders and sauted cauliflower the ham croquettes may have been the best thing i have ever tasted pricing for food is fair although the wine list gets pretty extravagant although for singapore it seems fairly normal come here you will not be disappointed\",\"the food throughout the night did not disappoint we had the croquette as a starter minus half a star for not having the foie gras slider when we visited last friday it was a dish i really wanted to try but it was not available we ordered beef slider which was tasty but i guess it was just that the fried squid was definitely tasty however it came in small portion the special of the day cauliflower was really good and crunchy the fish and cheese mac and cheese ball lookalike thing was spot on you gotta try this when you visit another highlight is the black squid ink paella i could come back again just to have a paella to myself if they are not so particular about the whole reservation sms and dining duration the pork ribs were good but not wow overall everything we have ordered that night is above average i would definitely be back to try more dishes minus another half a star for the pain of having to reserve on the phone with the missus who have hearing problem and make a fuss about replying confirmed by pm the next day and endless reminders that we have to leave by certain timing\",\"i asked my friend ning when she would be free to celebrate her mid november bday and she said let is do dinner this thursday she is busy with med school so she has to seize the day evening she said try foc i had heard of it but had thought another tapas bar ok whatever made bookings early ok left a voice message to callback to add an additional person and they did not call focing service i thought to myself but i called back and they were helpful as can be thereafter it was all uphill we arrived just before pm on a thurs night and the place was getting full we had not asked but they had given us  girls counter seats on the leftmost side of the counter right in front of chef jordi getting to ask him about the food even the ones not destined for us watching him and the other staff hard at work chatting about his recommendations and preferences really added to the experience we had croquetas de setas mushroom croquettes  cuatro unidades  units sorry the nod goes to binomio on this one the batter was slightly overfried but the th piece which i did not eat was noticeably a shade lighter in colour than the other  and the inside was full of bites of maybe porcini mushrooms tasty and mushroomy but binomio wins for the smooth cream filling evenly exuding mushroom flavour both places seem to serve the croquestas on the same dab of garlic mayo incidentally the same garlic mayo dabbed on foc is black rice paella and binomio is squid ink pasta fideua we had a daily special recommended by chef he called it the huevos dish and it was basically potato pieces fried with crispy edges served with an egg on top and in a skillet simple but again very yummy and perfectly seasoned ie not too salty one of ning is and my favourites nadia does not like tomatoes was the watermelon gazpacho with charcoal olive oil ice cream we ordered one portion to share and chef jordi thoughtfully split the ice cream into  separate bowls the gazpacho was incredibly smooth and tasty and tomatoey with just a touch of sweetness from the watermelon nadia does not like tomatoes other than fresh ones in salad or in the background like pizza sauce but she loved the icecream mixed with the gazpacho and ate up every last drop of her portion that is how good it was food was very tasty without being cloyinging rich and greasy which can be the risk of spanish restaurants in spain as well as here the black rice arroz negro with seafood paella  was luscious without visible separated oil unlike binomio and la bomba and sabio the plumpness and bite of the rice was perfect really good quality rice handled well another strong recommendation by chef jordi the grilled ribeye at  was meltingly tender and served medium rare originally i thought he was talking about the kg beef on the bone and i asked erm too much for us  he said no just nice for sharing i was thinking ok maybe we look very hungry and later when i realised it was a ribeye steak portion phew i told him about the intiial misunderstanding and we had a good laugh about it this was g and we were all commenting how tender and juicy and really good the meat was and my other  friends also raved on about the grilled peppers served on the side of it note on the cocktails nadia had the smells like gin spirit  tasty and refreshing gin version of a mojito i had the chef is favourite bloody jordi also  and is a bloody mary type with an asian sour twist looking at the description again that must be the kimuchi no moto korean kimchi base dario the mixologist said it had   shots of tequila in it i could not taste the alcohol but he said it was not meant to be a strong alcohol forward drink it is true the spices and tomato was the prevalent sensation and not everyone will like that flavour combination but it was interesting to try something new my friends all commented it was so savoury like a soup and it did go down very easily i suppose it is a silent killer but i was happy to get on to the excellent house wine i had the angelitos negros  at   a glass after all that chef asked if we wanted a small bite each he then prepared  pieces of scallops topped with their soy caviar tapioca sago so we could have  each when the standard serving is  fresh juicy and plump w slight char  we went through the courses very smoothly all tapas but felt like a proper dinner all the way and happily ended with the chocolate burger at  and the torrija  overall food was fresh not overstated not over seasoned refreshing very yummy but not bludgeoning on the palate a small portion of torrija with a candle and with happy birthday written in dulce de leche on the plate was served complimentary and unexpectedly even the valet from purple valet waited to close all our doors for us as we got into the car i do not know if that is part of the restaurant training but kudos\",\"outstanding each dish we had was phenomenal and the drink was icing on the cake fabulous and will be back\",\"lucky to snatch a seat at the bar on a thursday night always wanted to visit foc and the food did not disappoint food is on the pricier side although i think the clientele probably wo not blink an eye at the price service is great although for some reason the couple dishes i ordered came out a bit saltier than im used to maybe i will ask for less salt next time\",\"great cocktails and great food do try their crackling pork and their paella superb rsvp is a must eventhough it is for weekdays\",\"when trying to discover the best laksa in singapore locals always pointed me to katong laksa so i had to give it a try this spot started as a hawker stand and blew up to having  locations now the food is so good that its attracted many celebrities and hype with the news the service is quick and snappy and this location fortunately has ac the laksa itself has a slighter milder taste but it is perfectly balanced with the seafood while sporting a nice spicy kick the noodles are also cut so you eat it with a soup spoon chopsticks are not even offered in addition to the laksa you can even pair it with otah or nasi lemak for not much more overall this was my favorite laksa spot i have tried and i highly recommend giving here a try\",\"did not know this place was so popular after walking in and seeing all of these famous people is photos plastered on the wall thought for sure it will be great in their laksa they do not use chicken or shrimp they use blood clams or also called cockles it was really spicy so i could only eat a few spoonfuls before giving up not sure i would be back as i cannot take the heat\",\"sweared by locals that this is the best laksa place in singapore so i had to give it a try this place looks like a fast food joint where you go up to the counter and order what you would like to eat and your name will be called when your food is ready there were  specials that you could order but mostly people just order the laksa in either small or large the large was split between my cousin and myself for about  sgd which is reasonable for a big bowl of laksa the broth was very creamy and noodles were cooked al dente this place only gives you spoons to eat your bowl but is easy to do so overall recommend this place if you are wanting to try some good laksa while in singapore\",\"in my previous sgp trip i had a great experience eating here this time around it was still satisfying but they skimped on the ingredients the sign of an over hyped industrialized tourist spot also i noticed the pictures of anthony bourdain has been removed from the wall what a shame the posters of other celeb visitors such as gordon ramsay martin yen samantha brown are still there just as i remembered got the standard laksa again the broth was still excellent as i remembered rich creamy smooth spicy but it only contained basic ingredients such as some bean sprouts a few cockles no other seafood e g shrimps unless you pay extra standard katong style short rice noodles that can be eaten with a spoon no chopsticks needed the  nasi lemak wrapped in leaf very forgetable rice was dry not much flavor even with their samba sauce it also contained a sorry looking piece of small dry fish overall the broth of their laksa is still one of the best i have ever had i just do not like the fact that they took advantage of their fame skimped on other ingredients i ate at multiple good laksa places including its equally famed competitor across the street as well as the trishaw laksa in hon lim center they both had descend amount of seafood in their standard basic laksa\",\"perfect michelin fast food for sgd this dish is made to be used with spoon only so you have some of the soup and broken noodles in one spoonful a bit spicy with a coconut milk flavor to calm the heat no napkins around here popular during lunch rush hour this is how laksa should taste\",\"had to have laksa in singapore and was told this is a place to try they said if there is a lot of celebrity pictures on the wall then it is probably a good place to eat there is nothing super fancy about the laksa except that it taste awesome i also had otah for the first time which is surprisingly good\",\"i really enjoyed the large bowl of laksa not too spicy the chili paste adds an interesting zing to the flavor the lime juice was very good as well i also ordered the shrimp siu mai the siu mai goes well with the chili paste\",\"the best laksa period living in toronto where you can virtually order any cuisine you wish i thought i knew what good laksa was after visiting  katong laksa it is officially ruined all other laksa for me located in a small restaurant this self serve joint is a no fuss type of establishment what is interesting is they do not provide chopsticks you are expected to slurp down your laksa with no other utensil other than your spoon not sure if this made everything taste better but this bowl was the best tasting laksa i have had even after trying several laksa joints in previous days the spicy kick and the creaminess of the broth provided a beautiful base to the noodles and seafood that soaked up all the flavor the serving was just enough to get you full although i wish i had room to try the other items tip bring tissue to wipe off sweat from the spice\",\"great bowl of laksa there is good seafood flavors with the bowl my only complaint is there is not enough seafood there is really only a few small pieces of mussels in there overall really good bowl of noods it is cash only fyi\",\"the laksa is the absolute bomb gordon ramsey even went to this location his picture is on the wall of shame the siu mai and the chili crab pau aka steam buns is a must order you can eat the noodles with a soup spoon ask for chop sticks and they say no\",\"their original laksa was so good you probably wo not find another laksa place better than this one and it is not just a hype the noodles are cut for you so can use a spoon to scoop out the spoonfuls of goodness this katong style laksa is filled with big prawns fish cake cockles mushrooms and topped with some coriander with a light coconut milk that is not too overpowering for visitors like me who grew up in north america we tend to lose a bit of appetite when traveling to hot cities like singapore  degrees that day i was there so i only ordered a small bowl since i was not sure if i could finish it on my own immediately after the first sip of the soup i regret not ordering something bigger i fell in love with the soup immediately and the temperature inside or outside did not bother me at all and was actually quite comforting a little sweaty after but not too crazy i wish i knew how to make this at home so i can enjoy this everyday i will definitely come back when i visit singapore again\",\"my first experience with laksa curry noodle soup and this place lives up to its hype as a  michelin star restaurant the broth was delicious and i could not stop eating despite wiping the sweat off my brow after every couple of bites i have a low tolerance for spicy food the place it unassuming cozy and prefers to have its food speak for itself what a nice piece of memory in katong\",\"shiok is truly the only word to describe this place although i suppose you could debate that personal preference plays a part in the singapore v penang style laksa battle i think katong laksa is miles ahead of all else the broth is deliciously bold with seafood coconut and curry flavors the noodles come cut so you can enjoy each spoonful with the perfect combination of soup and noodles cheap delicious authentic yum\",\"i came from hawaii to taste the original laksa that made my mouth water when i ate it in honolulu i was disappointed again fame baby remember my name made this place famous and is again part of its notoriety downfall soup tasty seafood i had a hard time locating the shrimp that was in their photos minimal noodles ok but i am used to two kinds the nasi lemak rice was a pleasant surprise\",\"the  katong laksa here is overrated the staff are rude and proud maybe because they are one of the most famous laksa store in singapore i feel that the laksa here is normal there are certainly many other better laksa around in singapore\",\"came by for breakfast after a couple suggestions from locals ordered the small laksa and did not quite get the hype at   sgd there was a small bowl of coconut curry noodles that actually quite thick the bowl was  noodles with a few tiny shrimps and fish cake took a few bites and went on with my day not quite sure i get the hype with laksa\",\"this was my first time trying laksa and it was pretty good at this restaurant there are two options for laksa large or small the large is   and the small is   i found the small to be plenty my husband had large and he did not finish it all they also have some appetizer items which we did not try you might want to bring your own napkin as you have to buy them for  cents if you need them\",\"my nose did not stop running the whole time i ate this laksa not pepper burn hot but more chili nose run hot once you start you cannot stop very addictive and tasty for my fellow americans do not be afraid of the fish cake not what i expected was very good my first laksa experience was a winner\",\"supaya dapat sim surat ijin mancing next trip sogok dulu pemilik sim dengan  katong laksa yang hmmmm wangi dan enaknya food   service  price place   halalrest  katong laksalocation east coast roadcity singapore\",\"this spot was convenient since it was right across the street from our hotel the laksa was tasty and delicious\",\"this is not just a third wave coffee house but it is also a proper dining establishment not only did i enjoy a rich bold ethiopian slow brew but i also enjoyed the common man full breakfast it looked a tad pricey from the menu but the plate itself did not disappoint it came with two free range organic eggs a large serving of bacon plenty of sausage a good amount of tomatoes an entire portobello mushroom a serving of chorizo baked beans as well as a large slab of toast while the coffee and the food might take a while to prepare staff members are friendly and engaging and the contemporary light filled venue hosts a mostly expat crowd there is a variety of seating for groups large and small whether at tables or at communal benches perfect for conversation reading or even some laptop work a nice find\",\"common man coffee roasters serves outstanding coffee paired with fresh food be forewarned that the restaurant is often packed the wait can be long up to  minutes in addition the prices are on the higher end but the ingredients and food quality are superb the flavor concoction makes the long wait and high price worth it the coffee is just amazing they have several varieties of coffee options all freshly brewed you can also buy their roasted beans to bring home to brew yourself drink some coffee eat good food and relax\",\"to my surprise i chowed down on a lot of different breakfast breads while in singapore be they pancakes or french toast and while the pancakes at common man were not quite up to the bar set by clinton street they were very good star  how were the service and atmosphere common man really knocks it out of the park when it comes to both their service and atmosphere you have got a big open space that does not get too packed even during peak days and times and it is comfortable enough to either relax with a group or get some work done our dishes came out quickly upon being ordered star star  how were the portions relative to the cost   for pancakes is well it is expensive and was actually even more expensive than high brow foreigner clinton street baking company for a comparable portion even so this is roughly what you expect from a high end breakfast spot in singapore star stars  and  how was the food these were very good pancakes were they the fluffy symphony that you can find at clinton street no but they had good texture good taste and some great peripherals in the nuts berry sauce and bananas presentation was top notch as well two stars star  would you be excited to go back it is only the fact that clinton street exists that i cannot give a fifth star here no star\",\"i was looking for an early morning breakfast place to help me deal with the jet lag when i first saw common man coffee roasters and read all the good comments they had they also have a yoga place upstairs where you can take classes so if you are an early bird or suffering from jet lag you can start the day with some yoga and come downstairs for a great breakfast i went with the eggs benedict and fast brew coffee eggs come with ox meat and they are delicious coffee is pretty good too they do breakfast and lunch and have some good looking desserts all in all this is a great place that i would absolutely recommend one small caveat though it seems to be a favorite for expats so if you are looking for some place where locals eat i do not know if common man should be your go to but hey you wont regret coming here\",\"i was quite impressed by the variety on the menu eggs in all different kinds and flavours to start with i just stuck to that my kale and scrambled eggs was super yummy and heartier than i expected it to be the house filter coffee to top this off with was excellent creamy and full of zing i would definitely go back there for more but the prices are on the high side for sure makes the coming back a little harder it was superr crowded for a sunday lunch too the communal tables are not the best bet if you are meeting friends it is hard to talk over the ambient chatter to someone sitting  people away\",\"normally come here for the coffee and brunch food however ordered a takeaway latte today and after waiting for  minutes i enquired about my order they could not find my order but apologised for it i really like their blends but  minutes is way too long to wait for a to go latte\",\"first time here the baristas were obviously not experienced or were swamped one cappuccino was over extracted and one under just was not pleasant the bean selection was in an awkward location where seated patrons were getting frustrated with potential buyers looking at roast dates lol it is a tight busy spot food was not bad a bit on the pricey end but the quality of the ingredients was good\",\"needed a normal breakfast as i have been traveling through asia for quite some time found this place with good reviews gave it a try it was so good that i went two days in a row queue was not bad at all but i was rolling solo so if you have a group it might be different i love the space and the communal tables very inviting and casual which is always a plus to me service is fine considering how busy they were their uncommon coffee was unbelievably good and i highly recommend it i was blown away by the flavors of the coffee bean and tried to buy some to take back but unfortunately they were sold out next time first day i was here i ordered the pancakes with a berry compote and walnuts great texture and a mix of sweet and salty pretty filling for two thick pieces if you love sweet breakfasts that is definitely worth a try second day i got the common man breakfast with poached eggs everything was fresh and it all married well together huge portions but not heavy which i liked if i lived in the area this would be my go to reminds me of brunch here in san francisco getting together with friends over good food and chatting away loved it\",\"lovely long blacks complement the great homemade granola filled big bowl of fresh fruit granola and yoghurt even for a hungry breakfasteer a big job to finish eating the whole bowl loved it nice crew serving the food\",\"coffee in singapore does not get better than the one served here great service and consistently delicious food it is my go to place\",\"came here based on the positive reviews and based on how busy it was it is obviously a popular location the staff was very friendly and helpful but i was shocked at the prices for what was provided s  purchased me a tiny take away latte with an okay pulled shot of espresso i forgot to order a croissant so i went back and ordered one which also shocked me at s  like the espresso the croissant was nothing to write home about overall for a few dollars less this would have been a  star review\",\"not impressed a bit overhypped the coffee was weak the fluffy pancakes were dense inside the vegetable rosti is not really a rosti maybe i was just unlucky but for my first experience the food did not impress me the service was great though\",\"i had the eggs benedict was quite unique with the braised ox cheek loved it also had fresh squeezed orange juice and their cappuccino only knock on the place was the service they forgot about us a few times and double ordered some items could be improved but food was yummy\",\"if you are yelping from singapore you are probably american and pretty basic luckily so am i and this place is effing delicious do yourself a favor and order the turkish breakfast but then please get some laksa later you are in singapore\",\"brunch here on a sunday morning good was solid but incredibly disappointed with poor service after waiving down  servers to see if my wife is food was coming and being promised that it was our original server came back and said she never even placed the order when i spoke to the manager about this she said she was not even aware that we had been waiting for half an hour not sure we would come back\",\"stayed at a nearby hotel and went twice to this little gem for breakfast they have amazing coffee and the menu is delicious the turkish common man is a really great vegetarian option the house baked cornbread is like a avocado toast on steroids and brioche french toast is huge great service and great atmosphere\",\"i end up in this place with my husband after making so research on google for best breakfast in singapore the place is amazing for breakfast they have everything you need from diet food with white omelette to fatty breakfast with bacon for my part it was fatty breakfast they also have delicious and original fruits juice like carrots orange and mint or celery sounds weird but i can assure you that the  juices that i tried were amazing the service is fast efficient and friendly i definitely recommend this little place\",\"i have been obsessed with places like this for such a long time now is that kind of place that you really feel to work out before coming having your breakfast coffee juice or lunch and you will feel healthy after being there i went there together with my mom before walking around in singapore actually we went there  times first time was before walking around in the city we had two salad and one green kale juice second time i went for the egg benedict it came with some kind of meat which i have never tried before and my mom was having a granola of course we both went for a cappuccino great place to come before work out i will before walking long because you know you will get some good ingredients and healthy food and also is so\",\"this is a big hit with the yoga crowd coming down from yoga movement but it is not a big hit to the taste buds super average food delivered way under expectations menu plays the health card well but make sure you avoid the baked eggs and quinoa salad not tasty by any measure eggs were dry like the gobi it draws a nice crowd but that is about it the drink menu only has three juices clocking in at  a pop and is just about the same size as a double espresso if you are looking to check out the yoga bods creep on over here if you are more interested in a good brunch mosey down to supermkt at rob quay\",\"we left the uk last year and have not had an english breakfast since nor have we had real bacon or sausages so this was amazing probably one of the best full breakfasts we have ever had anywhere i will certainly be back well done\",\"nestled in a strange food complex think food court style stalls with a pub outside is tom is palette tons of flavors to pick from and the texture was really light yet creamy saw pipagao chinese cough syrup and had to try it was so strange but in a good way ended up with the matcha and plum both were delicious definitely worth a visit if you are close by\",\"i enjoyed tom is a lot i had half passion fruit and half botany which was a mother is day special gelato with floral notes and some white chocolate pieces their flavours are very unique even includes pepago the traditional chinese cure all medicine syrup the texture was very creamy too i would highly recommend\",\"the icecream flavors are really interesting and you get to choose  flavors in  small cup i had the passionfruit and milo dinosaur flavor and loved it\",\"love the creativity and abundance of gelato flavours here but unfortunately the waffles lose out to merely and creamier still good location bugis and the  pm promotion means i will still visit frequently french waffle   starsvery eggy and warm out of the iron but slightly overcooked nothing extraordinary nice thing is they serve the waffles with crumbled oreos berry coulis and syrup on a pretty plate brownie waffle  starscrispier and more flavourful than their french waffle if you like chocolate or brownies i am neutral on both you will love these ice cream white chocolate nori  starslots of that umami seaweedy taste very generous with the chocolate chunks so frickin tasty yuzu  starslychee   starshas lychee chunks in it ale and crack candy   starssugar overload candied pecans yumminess triple s  starsshoyu sesame seeds salted chocolate super flavourful and slightly too salty but i love the uniqueness chocolate stout   starsif you like the title you will probably like this flavour salted egg yolk   starsunfortunately my least favourite of all the flavours i tried tastes like  but the texture lumpy gritty and there are already so many salted egg yolk desserts so i do not particularly want to taste it again in my ice cream cornflake  starsdisappointing compared to humphrey slocombe is secret breakfast and momofuku is cereal milk they also had some pretty standard flavours like rum raisin goma and more snazzy ones like banana honey roasted nuts smokey road salted caramel cheesecake mala chocolate but i could not try them all\",\"interesting flavors and pleasant staff the stand in located in the back of shaw tower not too near to much we walked there from the fairmont hotel and were very pleased the flavor selections seem to rotate frequently you should try some of the flavors there seemed to be a large range from delicious to why would you make that into an ice cream flavor i found the alcoholic stout beer flavor to fall into the why did they make it category\",\"i do not know how someone would just come across this place by chance it is tucked away down a hallway that does not appear to get much foot traffic i do not think there is any signage on the street outside either i recently visited on a tuesday afternoon and the building was dead except for a handful of people having ice cream here but it is worth the trip an excellent variety of traditional and non traditional flavors with good texture perfect antidote to hot humid singapore days\",\"i have been doing myself a tremendous disservice by never checking this place out until now to think i spent three months interning across the road but never made tom is palette a priority the best part about tom is are the inventive delicious flavors it may be easy to dump thimbles of yuzu syrup into the ice cream machine but it is difficult to produce ice cream of the right sweetness and texture flavors include grannys favorite salted caramel cheesecake berries and split pi pa gao and of course usuals like chocolate strawberry i highly recommend the yuzu flavor it is sweet light and refreshing we also tried a mix of chocolate and grannys favorite a mix of chocolate malt marshmallows i think and spent awhile chilling in the spacious interior there are many tables and it reminds me of those student haunts at upper thomson also ah loy thai right opposite is superb another excuse to visit toms i wish there were more independent creameries ice cream shops like toms daily scoop creamier i have gotta play my part in supporting and frequenting them\",\"i know of this place thanks to a yelper who recommended it not the easiest place to find as i had to use the goggle map to find its exact location located at shaw tower along beach road its on the ground flour just walk all the way in and you find it interior of this ice cream place looks ordinary and you would think this is just a normal ice cream place but wait till you try the flavours i was amazed with some of the unique flavours such as the granny is favourite and the salted egg yolk flavours you cannot get this anywhere else at least to me there are so many other flavours to try but having only one stomach i got to take it easy so coming back here is definitely in my agenda\",\"never knew there were such ice cream flavors in existence until sample the hottest flavors typically   either the conniseurs recommends or the trays with less than half left to scoop from should hint preference the rum favourite\",\"now getting there was not super easy because it is not very close to bugis mrt but this shop is nestled in an old building sort of dingy if you ask me i sampled a few flavors but i only really wanted to try the salted egg yolk one because i am a liu sha bao afterall i thoroughly enjoyed my ice cream but i suspect it was made with salted egg yolk powder not salted egg yolk itself nonetheless delicious until i found a lump of cold hard butter on the second last spoonful i nearly fainted from the revelation that a good load of butter was used in the production of my ice cream but  stars it is and yes i would most defo come back\",\"i am not sure how i can do this place justice with just another review but i try cones waffles and cupswhich will i choose from herewhen

it is clearmy world crumbles when you are not neargoodbye and i chokei try to walk away and i stumblethough i try to hide it it is clearmy world crumbles when you are not near\",\"i love the range of choices at tom is palette and they do change it quite frequently but somehow i always end up with my absolute  favorites granny is favorite and chocolate despite tasting the other flavors granny is favorite is just soooo goood that i am loathe to eat other flavors if i remembered correctly it has some horlicks to it and is a bit malty i am not sure if they still allow it but i used to be able to get  flavors in a cup not  scoops i thought that was a very nice practice as sometimes you do not want to have an entire cup of the same flavor the chocolate is rich and dark a bit bittersweet just the way i like my chocolate with no fillers or cheap ingredients ruining the taste\",\"alas i have downgraded my review to four stars still exceptional ice cream the melt and sizzle is very tasty while a nasty mix is a little too sweet for my palate this time i got a medium of the latter and salted caramel cheesecake the cheesecake was scrumptious but the nasty mix caramel nuts and chocolate was far too sweet very busy on a friday evening so the service was rushed but that is to be expected\",\"what a place with unique flavors excellent customer service and reasonable prices i got the honey lavender ice cream with banana walnut you can choose  flavors even for the smallest size and paid   the employees there are not shy about offering samples for their unique flavors which i also appreciated a great place to hit up after having spicy food next door at ah loy thai\",\"great hidden place in bugis for fantastic ice cream it is in one corner of the shaw building across the road from the row of shophouses near bugis junction there is a variety of flavors and the speciality is the layers in textures with ingredients rather than just plain ice cream the flavors change from time to time and when i visited a few caught my eye salted egg yolk white chocolate nori seaweed grandma is favorite chocolate malt dough and yuzu etc customer service was very good and sample servings were big p\",\"impressed with the innovative flavours of the ice cream but slightly disappointed with the taste had the salted cheesecake and salted coconut flavours both were too sweet for my liking but overall i would say if you have a sweet tooth and love to try interesting flavours like salted egg yolk and other alcoholic flavours then this place is for you\",\"interesting flavours to cool you down in warm humid singapore throughly enjoyed the egg waffles topped with chilli chocolate and salted egg definitely favours that shouts local and hardly available elsewhere friendly and enthusiastic service tops it off\",\"tom is palette is easily my favourite ice cream joint in singapore it is got interesting flavours which change all the time friendly staff and prices as well as an overall fun casual vibe food i am in love with the melt sizzle a mixture of berries and chocolate chunks already sounds pretty amazing but wait till the pop rocks zing and sizzle on your tongue making it a regular party in your mouth i also love the mocha macnut which as its name says is a generous mixture of macadamia nuts in mocha ice cream the rose and lavender flavours are also really unique for those who appreciate something novel and light which i do but as my ice cream philistine of a friend remarks it could feel like eating potpurri the salted caramel is also really good but i tend to like texture in my ice cream so i get bored after a spoonful or two ambience fun and casualservice polite and friendlyshaw towers is a bit out of the way for me but i try to make a pilgrimage there once a month\",\"fresh update triple coconut even better than the previously reviewed coconut dublin coffee is awesome with a hint of guinness toms palette always surprises with wonderful flavours the ice cream texture however is less than perfect but that is okay the flavours make up for it test drive a couple of flavours before you commit\",\"their salted caramel cheesecake ice cream is just brilliant it is my most favorite ice cream ever the flavor is just so rich and indescribable sweet and savory at the same time each scoop is pure delight pair this with granny is favorite and you have got my idea of the perfect ice cream duo granny is favorite is chocolate ice cream with random burst of malt that seem to complement salted caramel cheesecake perfectly i have yet to try other flavors from tom is just because i was so blown away by these two flavors that i always end up going for them i need to be more adventurous eh\",\"this is a really nice museum i highly recommend it i bought a ticket on klook and went to the disney magic of animation exhibit that is open until the end of march i was also hoping to go to the future world exhibit but because it was during a peak vacation period i did not make it there in time luckily that exhibit is permanent so i will come back another time to see it hopefully the magic of animation exhibit is really nice if you are an animation fan i used to work at pixar so this was right up my alley they have original storyboards and art from the production of most of the majorly popular disney movies from steamboat willie to frozen ii finally i want to mention that the lines were incredibly long as this was around new year is day i recommend reserving at least a half day or more to see two exhibits since i was being rushed out of the magic of animation exhibit since they were closing the museum for the evening\",\"located in the iconic lotus shaped building at marina bay sands the future world exhibit is a must see the collection of interactive artworks are aesthetically pleasing from the moment you enter you will be immersed in the world of visual arts and interactive structures with over a dozen themed rooms here are some of my favorites sketch town allows visitors to color a preset drawing personalize it scan and watch your masterpiece come to life on the screen i did a quick coloring of a truck personalized it with my name on the side and watched in awe as it is displayed across the screen media block chair consists of vibrant glowing blocks that changes into countless variation of colors when attached together designed for visitors to create fun structures from stacking and arranging the blocks into whatever your imagination pleases crystal universe is not only extraordinary but breathtaking as well it features captivating animated lights that changes colors at an instant the occasional supernova gives you the illusion of being in a celestial environment surrounded by shimmering stars if you are press for time or are only interested in doing just one exhibit i highly recommend future world it is  sgd per adult and  sgd for children   whether you are seeking an educational or fun adventure or looking for a distraction this modern marvel will provide hours of fascination for visitors of all ages\",\"one of my favorite spots in singapore located near the marina bay this place definitely fits the futuristic and polished vibe in all aspects the artscience museum houses various displays that will surely amaze you ticketing allows you to choose a single exhibit or combinations of any of what you are interested in making it your money is worth and tickets are not too bad to begin with if you are a student be sure to get the discounted prices we decided to see future world and floating utopias and were wowed future world various rooms with interactive light and digital art displays it is perfect for photos due to rooms that contain very aesthetically pleasing sets there is also rooms that allow for your imagination to come to life by allowing your doodles to become digital renderings that move around in a virtual city the light displays are magical and let you use your smart device to control them floating utopias is more informative but still has some photo ops there is a room with giant inflatable rabbits a moon and much more this one was more lowkey and it balances out everything else overall highly recommend this place it is beautiful and gives you a sense of how futuristic singapore truly is plus you will get some cool photos from your visit here\",\"you can buy one exhibit two or all i would not mind getting all right next to helix bridge and always someone there to answer questions cute science art quotes on the walls and a spectacular place for both kids and adults future world meets science exhibit it is small visually pleasing and the room at the end where you enter space the lights are amaaazing the security guy can control the lights but can only tell you when super nova is coming stick around for that downstairs upon entering you walk into the fab cafe they have d printing available and cute little earrings too popcorn flavors like calamari sour cream and onion and also prosciutto snacks available remember that around holidays it can get really busy\",\"it is one of the best place to look at exhibitions in singapore i love the alice in wonderland love the imagination future world magical and light exhibition good for ig videos\",\"good place to take your kids out for an afternoon especially if they have those kid friendly exhibits running at the time my friend and i bought all three exhibits and it was nice seeing how educational they are some of the kids oriented ones are very interactive the one we saw had the interactive drawings where you could see your car or house come to life on the big screen on the wall if you sign up for a membership it was free if i remember correctly you can get a bogo deal essentially on tickets one for you and one for a friend which helps a lot in reducing the costs\",\"best museum i have ever been to the futureworld exhibit which seems to have a permanent home here is the most wonderful playground for imagination for both kids and adults from the moment you enter you will forget about outside world and be immersed in interacting with the environment there are several rooms that you will visit in order each with unique features from lounging on the beanie bag in a room surrounded by ocean waves to drawing and scanning images that will appear and float around on the walls last part is a play with led lights that mystical and sci fi at the same time on rd floor they have different exhibits and i am so happy to have made one on street art that outlines graffiti evolution and includes original art by some of the local artists overall i have been to this museum twice already and i cannot imagine visiting sg without going again i cannot give it enough stars\",\"great views of the flyer helix bridge and the lotus garden around the museum we got buy one get one free admission to the two exhibits there with the marina bay sands loyalty card  for two people and we had a lot of fun we could have spent easily   hours there and there was a lot to do read and explore very kid friendly they do a good job here with a good amount of variety and photo opportunities i would definitely come back and see different exhibits\",\"the exploratorium in san francisco is one of my favorite places on the entire world and has been since i was a tiny kid now the artscience museum gives it a run for its money an interactive museum we spent way more time here than a  year old and a  year old probably should have the futureworld exhibit is so much fun boasting about a dozen different installations admission is fairly standard with other museums at  sgd for adults my personal favorite was the crystal universe an expanse of fairy lights dangling from the ceiling that lit up to music think along the lines of yayoi kusama is works there were a handful of cute little installations of forests cityscapes and oceans they allowed for kids and shameless adults to color in animals and cars to scan into the scene such a cute idea it was pretty crowded when we were there with tons of people running about on a monday afternoon i think we would have enjoyed it more had there been about  of the people there we unfortunately were visiting during the few days in between other exhibits we missed the street art exhibit and were too early for the marvel there was not much information about the exhibition dates online so that was a real bummer we did participate in the into the wild interactive activity but got bored pretty quickly and gave up we also took a quick browse through the gift shop where there were some fun little things but did not have too much of a selection futureworld is definitely worth checking out if you have got an hour or so to kill in singapore would highly recommend especially if you are already around the marina bay sands and want a reprieve from the muggy heat\",\"alice in wonderland is on exhibit right now it is an interactive exhibit that has you reading and searching for clues if you love alice then be sure to go the exhibits change so check to see what is in before you head out i also enjoyed future world but this was definitely geared more for children\",\"this was such a waste of my time the art work literally made me laugh with the lack of talent it is s  a person for  min of my day that i cannot get back\",\"came here for the special exhibition and was blown awayyyyyyy we loved every part of it especially the infinity mirrors which is everyone is favourite hands down  recommend everyone to check this out if you are in singapore we used the student discount too\",\"this museum was truly one of the neatest museum i have ever been too singapore knows how to make the mark this museum has a cool exhibits the future exhibit was truly creative and neat it was truly artistic but had great factual accents to it the nature and human body exhibit was mind blowing we got to see the most futuristic robot which was so incredible and was able to carry a conversation with you the museum is located by the marina bay sands and a place where you and honestly spend hours at it is a great place to have a family adventure where you can bond learn and spend time at the exhibits are really great for all those who are photographers out there you will be able to really capture the beauty of this place if your ever in singapore check this place out it will be one of the highlights of your trip\",\"i think your experience here greatly depends on what exhibits are available we paid extra for two special exhibits marvel  year anniversary and wind walker along with the regular museum i really enjoyed the exhibits and felt the rest of the museum could have been a miss maybe it is more appealing to families with small kids when we went in august the future world was not open\",\"came here and had  options for exhibitions went to minimalism and it was right up my alley loved the future world exhibition as well you can play with the exhibitions and they are quite interactive definitely a must see in singapore if you have a few hours to walk around perfect for a rainy day\",\"review only for future world where art meets science exhibit i learned about the artscience museum from viewing an instagram story from travel instagrammer that i follow jack morris doyoutravel he posted a few ig stories of the future world exhibit i thought that it looked pretty cool and i wanted to check this out while in singapore admission for this exhibit was  sgd for adults and  sgd for seniors i e for my dad we came on our last day in singapore during the morning and spend    hours here there is  sections to view it is a fun and interactive exhibit that the kids will definitely enjoy as a grown adult woman i enjoyed it myself and my dad liked the exhibit too my favorite sections of this exhibit  black waves you will be in a dark room and there is animated ocean waves in the background there were some bean bags that you can sit on and relax while watching the animation  connecting block town the projection screen will show the animation when you move various block pieces on the table  sketch town you can draw and color cars trucks airplanes or buildings on a piece of paper you scan your completed image into a scanner then you will watch your drawing come to life on the huge animated projection screen  universe of water particles the animation of the waterfall was quite nice  sketch town aquarium similar to sketch town but you can draw and color a bunch of different sea creatures  light ball orchestra i saw that the kids had a lot of fun in this area it is a bunch of bouncy balls that changes color  crystal universe it was the last room and it was amazing i never experienced anything like it there is a pathway where you walk thru a bunch of animated lights note it maybe difficult to take a really cool photo here since the lights flicker changes very fast overall i had a fun time i cannot wait to comeback again one day to check out other cool exhibits\",\"we came here just for the futureworld exhibit which is reason enough to come here as it is pretty spectacular we really enjoyed every portion of it from the sea rising room to the crystal experience i also really liked the layout of the exhibit had a great flow from exhibit to exhibit and was easy to follow only downside is the ball room was just overrun with kids i know it is a museum and caters to all ages but made it a tad bit hard to enjoy when kids are throwing balls all over etc it reminded me a bit of the ball pit at chuck e cheese if i were them i would allocate a small section of the ball room for adults only or those adults without kids as it would be nice to enjoy it without having a ball hit you in the head my fav part was the crystal portion which is truly mesmerizing also the kids here were very well behaved prolly cuz they were mesmerized too\",\"really pricey for such short exhibitions the marvel universe experience was lame and for  was a total waste of money i am glad i came to it while in singapore but it is only a tourist trap the building itself is gorgeous and it is worth the trip just to say i have been there\",\"wow just wow this was the most interactive museum space i have ever seen i wish i would have taken my son you could literally spend hours in this place and still not experience it all it is on the marina bay sands campus so its really close favorite parts wave and waterfall roomscrystal light tunnelaquarium roomthe aquarium was probably the most interesting room to me you make a drawing of a sea creature and insert it into a machine which scans the image and animates it onto a screen that looks like an aquarium as you get close to the animated drawing it swims away from you it blew my mind and i am sure this description does not do it justice there was also a graffiti art show here with the original sheppard fairy obama screen print as well as his obey posters and a plethora of other artists there was even a wall you could tag on or put stickers on i was not expecting this type of experience walking in the door i would definitely recommend this not so humbly submitted michael c\",\"to be honest it was okay maybe because we have so many amazing science and art attractions in north america pricy for exhibits good to see but not a must see for me\",\"located within the singapore botanic gardens the national orchid garden is definitely worth a visit for some fresh air in tourist friendly surroundings outside the main entrance is a gift shop a snack beverage kiosk and plenty of benches once inside there are beautiful orchids of different colors all over the place the entire grounds are well maintained and pleasant on the eyes most importantly despite the singapore heat and humidity i did not see any insects bugs roaming around the grounds so definitely some magic at work by the groundskeepers fellow tourists were wondering why there were not any bugs either the entire place never felt crowded as other local attractions tend to be all in all this was definitely a great fresh air outing for me and certainly a place in singapore that i would recommend to visitors\",\"if you like orchids this place will be your favorite botanical garden in the world when you go into the garden you will pay a few extra dollars to enter the orchid area however it is worth it there is rows upon rows of all types and colors of orchids along with artful designs there is a little bit of climbing involved and a few different paths with arches and tall structures filled with orchids the placement of them is very artistic further up is a building with some special orchids named after political dignitaries except to spend at least an hour or more if you want to take more photos they have a fairly nice gift shop that sells some orchid designed items to take home it can get pretty hot and there is not many shady areas so remember to bring some sunscreen and or a hat it is fairly humid so you will want to bring some water too\",\"when you visit the singapore botanic garden you gotta make your way in to the national orchid garden how can you not for  admission it is the only garden with an admission fee but it was incredibly organized well maintained and in full bloom with vibrant flora orchids back home got nothing on these the variations were stunning and there were different sections like the greenhouse and cool house that allowed for these plants to flourish honestly the cool house was the best part of the path situated toward the middle it was the best resting place with sinapore is humidity as a tourist that heat was something i could not get used to haha i probably spent at least two hours in the garden the flora was admirable stunning and unique in their own way from petal shape to the patterns colors they exhibit i am sure i snapped like  photos of the garden alone ridiculous but i got to see things i have never seen before and things i may never see again haha trust me it is worth taking a look and before you leave pick up a ginger refreshment near the ginger garden if you love ginger you wo not want to miss that\",\"definitely worth the  entrance fee the orchids are breathtaking and there is an incredible variety the best part is the bird cage that is full of orchids this was one of my favorite parts of my visit to singapore tip if you have a student id make sure to bring it to get the discounted price of just\",\"i loved all of the orchids but my favorite were the ones named after famous people like princess diana some of the orchids are absolutely exotic and rare this garden will keep you enthused and lost with love over orchids you can tell that this place is very well maintained just make sure to pack some water because it is pretty pricey in the garden and with the insane humidity you will need water\",\"review  singapore review  in my humble opinion if you are in singapore and have any interest in flora or fauna one absolute must is a visit to the national orchid garden yelp com bizphotos nati it is located within the singapore botanic gardens by the way this is the only botanical gardens in the world open from  am to midnight and free every day of the year the national orchid garden is open from   am to  pm and entry is just  singapore about   us which is so worth it there are   orchid plants  different species about  species on display and more than   hybrids these orchids range from the very small yelp com bizphotos nati to the very large these are over  inches across yelp com bizphotos nati so many interesting varieties with stunning colors yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati some with spots stripes and unique coloring yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati there are a number of varieties named after famous people as well this one is the margaret thatcher perhaps because it looks old and shriveled up lol yelp com bizphotos nati so many bright colors yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati yelp com bizphotos nati you can easily spend a half day wandering around looking at everything so plan accordingly i took  photos and could have easily taken  more but my camera battery died dammit one thing that gave us a nice break from the heat humidity was the cool house a very large glass enclosure that was wonderfully cool and tropical inside overall i was truly amazed as i never knew so many different sizes shapes and colors of orchids ever existed highly recommend\",\"definitely my favorite spot in singapore the singapore botanic garden is huge and there is so much to see you could easily pack a nice picnic lunch and spend your entire day there the park itself is free but there is a nominal sg  fee to get into the national orchid garden and it is absolutely worth it orchids are my favorite flower so seeing all the different types in various shapes colors and patterns all in one place is just fabulous plus the garden has designated photo spots for you to take the best pictures with the most beautiful backgrounds it took us maybe   hours to walk through the orchid garden alone quite spacious and beautifully laid out word of advice make sure to bring an umbrella just in case we were there at the end of monsoon season in november and we were caught in a torrential downpour if it were not for our umbrellas we would have soaked through must visit if you are in singapore\",\"it was a gorgeous place and i kept thinking that i would stop feeling impressed as we went further but it never happened it was a great place and i took a ton of photos remember to bring sunblock or a hat and definitely bring bug spray if you are susceptible to bug bites it is in the middle of the gardens free entry to the main gardens but you have to pay to come into the orchid gardens the gift shop is air conditioned which meant i lingered and ended up buying a small souvenir singapore is known for gold coated orchids and this is a place where you certainly can find them although possibly cheaper at other places i found myself wishing i lived closer and could buy some of the tiny live orchid plants which we thought were a good price at around  us\",\"if you are visiting the singapore botanical garden free the extra admission fee s  to see the orchid garden is definitely worth it it is truly beautiful and wonderfully curated\",\"this garden is amazing there were so many unique orchids and it was larger than i expected very fun place to explore\",\"i am not sure why everyone raves about this place it is just like any other well manicured flower garden that i have visited as a plus singapore is humidity and constant rainfall facilitate the great growth of wonderful colorful orchids throughout this garden so i thought that i might as well take a look being a student i only had to pay sg  for entry so i was already excited there are signs throughout the garden that say photo spot and there is a funny area where orchids are named after famous international celebrities such as shah rukh khan because they have visited the garden after a while the same view got a little monotonous so my  friends and i decided to leave all in all it was worth the dollar that i paid note i am a nature person so i do appreciate a great flower in bloom\",\"we went here last year at it was fantastic kyla pangcoga\",\"well i was not expecting this after having lunch at nearby halia my companion could not stick around with me afterwards but did recommend that i check out the national orchid garden for a minimal fee of  i figured oh what the hell and decided to check it out i am not a flower person but oh sweet jesus this garden blew me away the landscaping and design is really something to admire viewing something like this in the us would probably cost you a  admission fee at least if you are pressed for time or if you are like my husband then i highly recommend visiting the mist house this is where they house all of the rare orchids the colors are bold and vibrant and you cannot help but be all whooaaaaaa and sweeeeeeeet and shit balls this is awesooooooome if you are tired of feeling sticky thanks to the  outdoor humidity chill out the cool house which simulates the rainforests that are located at higher elevations i actually did not find this at all interesting but it was a nice respite from the humidity this garden is definitely on the top of my list for must see singapore attractions after all it is the largest display of tropical orchids in the world who would want to miss that bring your camera and enjoy my husband meaning you might have add you do not really care about details and you like to rush through sightseeing tours say that you have been there done that and move on ugh men\",\"this garden is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful the botanic garden is free but this section has a  admission fee and it is totally worth it the garden is quaint and small they sectioned the garden into little zones vip zone celebrity zone award winning zone etc theres a fair amount of shade to keep the walk pleasant and enjoyable\",\"if you love flowers then you will have an absolute organsim in this place because this entire garden is made up entirely of flowers to be precise orchids i have never seen so many flowers in my entire life okay it is a part of the singapore botanic gardens but the fact that yelp and other websites list this seperately goes to show how amazing and mind boggling beautiful this place actually is if you are in singapore for a couple of days and you do not go here then you are seriously missing out on one of the most beautiful artificial places in the world and i do say one because there are others that i have been too even though i am nowhere near an expert on international travel than some people are here you will find flowers flowers and even more flowers okay they are all orchids but does that matter when all you are wanting to look at are flowers in fact i never realised that you could do so much with a single species of plant until i came here all i can say is that this place is absolutely amazing\",\"i love the national orchid garden as literally an urban refuge i think it is one of the few places in the botanic gardens where you do not hear a children and b the road it is a gorgeous part of the central core which means that you have to walk a bit but it also means that you are near symphony lake and halia it is not a garden more like gardens there is burkhill hall which is also a spot you can hire for parties and weddings nestled amongst orchids named for various leaders celebrities etc there is the mist house and the cool house and various collections of rare and exotic plants you could spend an entire day there plenty of shade and seating if you planned ahead and brought in your own sandwiches and drinks because the only refreshments available in the orchid garden itself come from a vending machine and frankly i am not impressed by the refreshment stand just opposite for those of us who love photography of persons not flowers the national orchid garden has marked out photo spots there is the golden cage the orchid grotto etc etc so perhaps the only pain you may face if you are not a misanthrope like me is when you have to wait for someone to finish posing before you can take your turn some details to note the garden closes at pm which means that the last ticket is sold at pm tickets are  for adults  for senior citizens  and up and students and free for tots below  i believe that they have some free entry days during the vacation period so just check out the website to be sure\",\"the national orchid garden has a huge range of orchids on display although i am not a big fan of plants flowers i did enjoy looking at the hundreds of orchids on display and marvelled at how gorgeous they were especially after hearing how difficult they are to cultivate and grow to deal with singapore is somewhat punishing humidity and heat there is an air conditioned area displaying what i can only guess to be orchids that do not survive well in the heat i must confess i spent a fair amount of time in that arena pa cute touch was designated photo spots around the garden with wooden benches and orchids framed around it for a good photo\",\"this is the most gorgeous place in singapore and one of the cheapest pleasures you can get in this city from the moment you step into the orchid garden it is like you enter another world an oasis in a city like singapore where it seems like malling is the only thing there is left to do this is another world no yelling people no bright bling bling and no smell of food left and right sometimes it is just worth to go back to the roots and enjoy mother nature i remember when i first visited singapore  this was the first thing i visited and i was and still am in awe about it come and see for yourself s\",\"came here as part of a family trip with people of all ages  to  and interests and everyone thought it was gorgeous tip bring your student id for a cheaper entrance ticket  singapore dollar otherwise pay the  singapore dollars to get entrance this is definitely one of the places in singapore where your buck gets you a lot of bang it is a beautiful oasis like stepping into a secret fairy garden with giant birdcages lillypad ponds streaming fountains and every variation of orchid you could imagine i was skeptical at first but found it totally worth it to leave a few hours to stroll through just the orchid part of the botanical gardens did not even touch the other parts even given the   a day i spent there i felt rushed to get through it all my favorite parts were the giant birdcage and the cool house imagine walking into a manmade rainforest with a waterfall and all inside the most air conditioned building on the grounds heaven this place just teems with beauty and nature and you cannot help but admire it all definitely recommended as part of your visit to singapore you wo not be disappointed\",\"so i love a decent walk and i can tell a pretty flower when i see one the combination of taking a nice stroll and taking in some ridiculously beautiful flowers all at a cost of just  student discount was such a wonderful way to spend the hour i was not expecting much of this place i thought just how big a deal can they make out of one silly flower a pretty darn big deal i never realised how many different species of orchids there were some     if i recall correctly nor did i realise just how big and mazy the botanic gardens was just where have we found all this land the orchird gardens was not just one roundabout but an island tour of sorts taking you through the vip section where flowers are named after several important people the mist room where you will find some crazy beautiful looking ones and the very appealing cool room where you can set your eyes on some carnivorous plants and walk through a wall of mist my adventure ended there because i thought that an hour was all we needed so that was all i put for my coupon parking along tyersall ave but the next time i am back and i will be back i am going for the long haul because there was still so much more to explore\",\"i love chicken rice and this chain just does it so well this location in particular keeps things moving despite being deluged with many customers who like myself want some delicious hainanese chicken rice and the accoutrements that go along with it\",\"came by for dinner the other night and it was a tasty experience thank you to yelper nik t for all the fantastic photos and review located in the novena area the restaurant itself features air conditioning the trickiest part is the service is rather mediocre started off with the daily soup and it was a soothing and refreshing way to start off dinner after a long day of traveling the kang kong belanchan was excellent with strong flavors and young vegetables portions were small which was perfect the   roast chicken was the highlight of the meal with fresh chicken roasted perfectly and super juicy the ginger onion dipping sauce was delightful too the noodles were a nice way to complement the meal too  head after tax and  service charge\",\"i would come back here every week if i can afford roundtrip airfare is from the us to here lol it is a good indoor space with ac to have a nice and quick lunch or dinner if you are in town and think outside is too hot or humid salt and pepper crabgreat flavor to the pepper sauce i have had this dish three times in singapore and their sauce is possibly the best word of caution this is a messy dish there is no good way to eat this your fingers are going to get dirty and sticky so just dive in and take care of business the quality of the crab was three star it felt a little undersized given the price paid i will give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt because it is late in crab season and i have been spoiled by the dungeness living in san francisco salty egg prawn with golden mini bunomg this is so delicious a bit sweet and tiny salty it is perfect sauce for the mini bunhai nun white chicken ricemy all time favorite singapore classic dish you can use garlic and spicy sauce from the table there are many famous rice chicken restaurants in singapore but this is definitely one of the best green vegetables stir fried with shrimp paste it is a bit salty but it tastes really good with ricebeef her fen very tender beef with white width rice flat noodles if you like rice flat noodles  and beef you will definitely like it there are few boba milk tea black sugar caramel is my favorite and dessert place that is right outside of the restaurant good way to end the meal for sure\",\"hainanese chicken rice is a national dish and one of those things you have to have when you visit singapore one spot consistently appears on all of the major lists and reviews to find it wee nam kee do not let its multiple locations make it appear like a chain and touristy it is serving up some pretty damn good bites and worth a visit while i am no expert on another countries national dish it was pretty good in my book and i would go back for more the chicken was beautifully cooked and the meat moist through it all and its simple flavors were quickly brought out by the fragrant rice filled with ginger and spice from garlic add the soy or chili flavored sauces on the side to your liking and your set the roast meats that you can order were not too shabby and the sauted vegetables were pretty delicious but not worth a  hour flight for service is quick and efficient while the line does add a bit of a wait time it moves at a decent pace prices are pretty reasonable so you could enjoy a few dishes to share the ambiance is simple and loud so probably not the best for that high level dinner meeting or that romantic special evening in a city filled with so many options would i go back heck yeah it was pretty good and i know i wo not be disappointed\",\"nd greatest place in singapore for roasted hainan chicken the poached steamed soya hainan chicken is below average very long wait time poor service from badly understaffed crew dumpling is horrendous tze char here is bad\",\"singapore is national dish is hainanese chicken rice and one of those things you have to have when you visit singapore business lunch and wanted local food so wee nam kee it was and i was quite happy the consistent good reviews are for a very good reason the food is good you get a lot and service is great i recommend the boiled white chicken the chicken was expertly cooked and the meat moist with a simple flavor that is enhanced by the fragrant rice that has ginger and garlic mix the ginger soy or chili flavored sauces that are on the table for different flavors\",\"the best chicken rice i have ever had in my entire life go with the steamed chicken although the roast chicken comes quite close also get the kangkung with some sort of balachan sauce as your veggies the salted egg yolk ribs are also bomb\",\"the roast pork did not taste super fresh and the char siu skin was not that crispy the hainanese chicken was fairly standard and the shark fin soup was okay\",\"if my latest check in says i have been here x then i have to give this place  stars i am no chicken rice expert although i have eaten my fair share of them in my few months here in sg the reason i keep returning to wnk as my favorite chxn rice place is simply because it is so delicious the roast chicken is my favorite because of the nice skin and tender meat pieces i also prefer that my ginger and chili pastes are separated in separate containers like it is here i like to make my own concoction wnk is a well established restaurant and clientele will continue to flock here for their hainanese dishes i was amazed to find out that the founder of wnk does not even cook at all great story great food\",\"i wonder why this place is so famous the chicken is pretty good but not the best singapore can produce and the rice is not very fragrant and just average other dishes we had tofu salted egg prawns kang kong were quite meh\",\"get the white chicken version that is their speciality the sambal version gang kung is good side dish i would skip the fried dish\",\"i went to their katong i branch and i was blown away before wee nam kee i frequently visited another restaurant in the area i did not find their rice to my liking but wee nam kee has great rice as well as great chicken i particularly like the roasted chicken and one of their tofu dish\",\"i love this restaurant the hainan chicken rice is so good i ordered the soya sauce roast steamed chicken bbq pork and roast pork taste really good the oyster sauce vegetables is also good conclusion recommended\",\"it was quite a long wait for the chicken and after trying it out i would say it is pretty good but not enough to blow me away for anyone visiting singapore you must try the hainan chicken rice the fragrant rice is my favorite part i ate  servings myself and i am also a big fan of adding lots of dark soy sauce to the chicken you should also order the sambal vegetables which is amazing i honestly thought the vegetables were more yummy than the chicken itself to complete the meal you should also order the soup of the day with it\",\"my friend took me to try to famous chicken rice near her office we got there early before the lunch time rush definitely a good call to go early since she was in a rush to return to work the line started to form after noon but we were seated slightly before the rush keep in mind that they leave wet naps on the table which will be added to the bill if you use them the chicken rice was amazing and it came with soup on the side we also ordered some veggies bbq pork and roasted pork the chicken was the highlight of the meal and the prices were reasonable the pork was not outstanding since i have had better elsewhere the portions were average but it is great that you are not stuffed by the end of the meal service was similar to a food court as they moved from one into their own location i do crave the tender chicken and will come back if i have the chance to return to singapore\",\"chicken and rice makes life finger lickin nice wee nam kee is among my top chicken and rice places in singapore in part because it is just a great gathering place for friends and family members the service is quick and efficient and importantly the chicken and rice and sauce are quite consistently good the chicken is tender and juicy and the rice perfectly captures the chicken juices\",\"i love the roast chicken here juicy meat and crispy skin and its condiments chili ginger and dark soy sauce the soup is tasty none of those watered down liquid other places called it as soup the rice could be better but is good enough for me especially when you put everything together in one mouthful it blends beautifully without distractions the dumpling was not bad but not the star i would have to try the noodle version as recommended by the king of singapore aka nik t some day the place is very noisy and if you are prone to headache you may want to get it to go instead the service is very brusque and efficient and one does not really linger over the meal\",\"singapore is a culinary paradise and hainanese chicken rice is one of its gems if you have ever come across the cnn go world is  most delicious food you will see this traditional dish stands confidently at number  thus there is no reason to skip it while we were in singapore wee nam kee hainanese chicken rice restaurant was our pick the place is located on

companion is a bowl of fluffy rice which boosts your appetite at an instant more importantly a meal for two will cost you anywhere from s  to s  which is a superb price tag recommendation roasted and steamed chicken rice soy sauce chicken riceread our singapore food guide thecoupleeats com singap\",\"review for nov very popular spot around the dinner hour make sure to call ahead for reservations or get take out definitely super delicious and would come here multiple times\",\"delicious this places was kind of hard to find i got the half chicken with all three flavors steam soyo and roasted their ginger garlic and hot sauce was super duper bomb their chicken was moist and delicious must know they charge for napkins even the wet napkins they give you when you seat they do not tell you until you open it and they will automatically put it on your tab i felt like this was a scam i never asked for wet napkins and they dare to charge it was only cents but considering their inconsiderate action kind of got me upset other than that their food wasss good\",\"beautiful absolutely stunning interior go for the beauty and a cocktail skip the afternoon tea the afternoon tea was not bad but was not something we left raving about we do afternoon tea on most of our trips and this was probably our least favorite the food was just ok the cocktails were top notch order the atlas orange gin and tonic\",\"bruce wayne approved this gloriously opulent art deco styled bar luxuriously appointed with vaulted mural ceilings is located in the ground floor of a gotham city inspired skyscraper named after the greek titans of endurance bearing the mirror sheened atlas stone in front of the entrance you will be pleasantly surprised as you enter and take in the optics of this stunningly designed wonder the best seating is at the bar where you can banter with the bartenders and be baffled by their bottlework or just stare at the bottles whatever takes your fancy i have had negroni old fashioned and gin tonic here and they are all exceptional executions of classic cocktails warning  there is a  gin tonic on the menu be careful you do not order that unless you really mean to order that warning  the beetroot chips are seriously addictive and whenever you get low they will refill these and you may lose track of just how many you have you have been warned warning  the cocktails are well balanced but boozy meaning you wo not be able to tell they have a whack in them when you stand up you may find yourself wobblier than a busted bike wheel so please do attempt to retain your dignity by walking slowly towards the exit highly recommended for the gin fanatics out there they currently have the world is largest hand curated collection of gin consisting of over   bottles\",\"what an awesome art deco bar it is very breathtaking the first time you see it the drinks are well crafted albeit they wo not be cheap   sgd it can be busy during happy hours but the wait should be brief it will be worth the experience one note there is a dress code you cannot enter with shorts sandals\",\"i knew from the photos that it was a beautiful bar but i am pleased to announce that the drinks are of equal quality the transatlantic really stood out as one of the most memorable drinks i had in singapore between the fresh apple juice and wasabi oil it was just unlike any drink i have ever had before interesting flavors and perfectly balanced the staff was really friendly and by the way they talked to some of the other guests at the bar i get the sense they have their share of regulars a very memorable experience in the haze of my singapore bar crawl\",\"it is on the top  best bars list and once you enter it is easy too see why the facade and decor would not look out of place in an egyptian museum that being said it is wickedly crowded and hard to get a reservation your best bet is to try a weeknight or very late on a weekend we went on a saturday at am and got lucky to get a nice seat drinks are great they have a extensive gin collection to boot and their cocktails are on point definitely worth checking out irrespective of whether you are staying here or just visiting\",\"one of the best bars i have ever been to literally really fancy lounges sophisticated decor high ceilings and amazing cocktails if you are ever in singapore definitely plan to grab a drink here and do not forget to dress to impress\",\"fricken awesome place this is a must visit place in singapore if you dont drink anywhere else this is the place you have to try the architecture is amazing the staff are all very friendly and customer service driven arrive early for a prime seat\",\"step into an art deco fantasy lounge surrounded by a three story high grand lobby catwalk dripping with detail read a cocktail menu written like a story book about the golden age sip some fantastic sgd cocktail blends bathe in chill but upvibe music beats nibble on some apps indulge in good company go home wishing every evening was this fabulous\",\"one of sg is most famous bars beautifully decorated with a wide drinks selection had a couple cocktails both the creative take on the classic e g atlas g t atlas martini and the more innovative ones are both good though some err a bit on the sweet sidegood vibes and service would recommend\",\"this is a very trendy and interesting bar the decor is quite unique with high ceilings and a very industrial or as one of my coworkers described it ghostbusters vibe to it i am not sure of the official dress code but i saw everything from jeans and t shirts to ballroom gowns and that was the same couple there are quite a few interesting drinks and spirits on the menu and you will pay for them the food menu is a bit limited but everything that we had was quite good they serve their gin drinks in large goblets with lots of ice and they match the tonic with the botanicals in the gin you select which i think is the proper way to do it definitely make a reservation especially if you have a group of more than two people or be willing to wait for however long it takes\",\"definitely one of the best bars i have been to period they hold the largest collection of gin in the world and even carry  bottles of champagne that date back to the titanic we my girlfriend and i also had some of the best pasta this bar definitely serves restaurant quality food i would highly recommend the atlas martini and the french  but i am sure that all their other drinks are just as amazing a big shout out to our bartender lee who took us on a private tour of the bar and even took the time to write us a list of bars to try out for the remainder of our trip we will definitely be back the next time we visit singapore\",\"wooowwwwwwwwwwwww literally our reaction when we walked into the building and saw the bar this was not a planned stop on our tour our guide just wanted us to walk by but we begged to be allowed one drink you cannot go to a top  bar in the world and not stop right so great intentions only to be told my husband could not enter because his nice shorts were still shorts and that was not allowed not even at pm in  degree weather so fail pay attention to the dress code here and please let me know how amazing it was and how much we missed out\",\"if you are looking to relive the roaring  is come here for a drink and you will feel like you are attending a jay gatsby party old sport the space is quite large and absolutely beautiful i also love that they do not cram you in tables right next to one another you will probably have to wait a while if you do not have a reservation but once you are seated you will be able to relax with plenty of elbow space i came here on a weekend in a group of  and waited over an hour to be seated if you like coffee or need a pick me up they have a really interesting cold brew cocktail i recommend all of the drinks were well made and service was friendly plus as an added bonus there is free popcorn\",\"amazingly beautiful a high ceiling gorgeous art deco bar with carefully crafted cocktails and great service a place to dress up or visit casually in an amazing building that brings back the golden age of architecture and i understand it was modeled after a s building from new york city i did not try food here although i am sure it is good they do serve caramelized savory popcorn here at the bar which was delicious definitely worth a visit\",\"gorgeous spot reminds me of the bar room at the beekman back home except much bigger and a bit more light the drinks were meh tasted like juice but the ambiance and atmosphere were amazing go for a drink or two that is all otherwise you wo not cry if you skip it\",\"a good gin bar with a vast selection of gin waitresses were really helpful in recommending gin selection depending on your taste and preference when you are overwhelmed by their selections pretty pricey food but will definitely come back again with friends to try out more gin\",\"once you walk in to this place you really feel like you are in a scene of mad men the interior design and staff uniforms really bring a unique feel to this bar the reputation of this place is well deserved food  starsdrinks  starsenvironment service  starsrecommendations louis cartieri came here for dinner the drinks and food here are really pricey but that is expected coming to a venue like this i ordered the cod and the truffle pasta special the food was good and not amazing the portion size is on the small side so you will need to order more than a main to feel full i asked the bartender for a recommendation and ordered the louis cartier this gin based cocktail was really nice and smooth i would definitely order this again\",\"if you like art deco and gin you will love this bar they literally have a library of gin that is a beautiful focal point in this gorgeous space the ceilings are super high and there is some seating on the partial second floor on the ground level there are booths comfy chairs loungey chairs and bar seating my friend and i came in the afternoon because who knows what kind of wait they might have for a table at night it was not crowded at all when we went we saw some people having high tea and drinks and just casually catchinwe got drinks and a snack i do not think you can go wrong with their cocktails here as my friend and i both enjoyed ours it did take a while to come out but the waitress was super nice and gave us a free dessert for our patience would highly recommend visiting\",\"denying us entry having a strict dress code when there are tons of open tables i am sorry that is beyond stupid and outdated no bar is that cool especially since we knew it would be expensive and we were willing to slap cash down for a gin so thank you for saving us money in the long run it is a beautiful bar that deserves  stars for the design but it is not as cool or unique as level  or the marina bay are to have guests limitations\",\"enter atlas one if the world is top bars and if i recall correct world is tallest bar the venue is beautiful reminiscent of an old bank it might have been there are many tables and lounges to sit on in addition to the bar area the cocktail menu is vast and impressive lots of options to choose from by style and spirit the most impressive was the vintage section you could try hundred years old gin but i cant imagine the taste experience my only thing was that it closes early am and last call was at  am being from miami we are used to bars closing past am other than this our visit and experience was truly wonderful\",\"this is our favorite city chow we regularly go when we are shopping downtown and also bring out of town visitors the crab dumplings are my favorite but the hubs loves the green beans we always order wonton soup\",\"for those who are used to the din tai fung locations in the u s prepare for a treat having said that if you are used to the din tai fung locations in taiwan or china singapore offers a slightly scaled down version more comparable to those locations in australia star  how were the service and atmosphere this din tai fung location is great tucked away in an underground mall with ample seating to my great shock we were seated immediately on a saturday afternoon and the place was virtually empty star star  how were the portions relative to the cost  sgd for  pieces of classic pork xlb is reasonable for singapore and other menu items were in the same reasonable ballpark refreshing given how expensive things can get here in singapore star stars  and  how was the food everything we ordered was good with particular kudos to the xlb and the pork buns one thing that i missed were the leaf wrapped rice dishes that i am accustomed to in china at din tai fung but what was offered on the menu there were other several sold out items was well executed single star star  would you be excited to go back always star\",\"food was great especially this red dates with glutinous rice my new favorite food it seemed that they should have more people work here it was really busy during lunch time and the service was kind of slow\",\"excellent chicken soup and various buns to try out nice place to eat for lunch or diner\",\"this was my favorite din tai fung dining experience to date i went on a weekend and it was empty what a refreshing surprise same consistency and all dishes were great but without any wait was amazing they did have a chili crab bun which is unique to singapore really enjoyed it reminded me of a crab cake with traditional chili crab flavor notes\",\"if you are in singapore and want great food in a definitely non touristy place this is it\",\"this place is packed and for a good reason craving xiao long bao and this hit the spot ordered the vegetable pork dumpling in chicken broth and that was amazing the servers are not great at communicating in english also they are very strange with refilling water   they would not unless your glass was empty and would only refill one person at a time and left unless you specifically stated to refill everyone is glass also double check if your order is correct on the receipt they misordered one of our dish but luckily i caught it before they sent it out so a new receipt was easily produced\",\"okay so it is a chain but omg they have got food service down to a science and their food chemistry is incredible i am so happy my husband i came here on our trip to singapore he is half asian so he is super picky about asian food and even he said it was the best dim sum he is had in years definitely hoping the one near our home in california is as good as our experience in singapore\",\"food is good they deserve credit for that but the hostess is awful the wait staff are poorly trained waiting in line for   hour is a challenge but you should expect much better service too many other really good dim sum options within this city expect more singapore you do not have to be the city of poor service\",\"wanted to try dtf since i learned that they have a location in los angeles ca never made it there but i had to try it here at least xiao long baos are good thin and bouncy wrapper flavorful filling but comes at the high cost our lunch today was  sgd which is crazy expensive for what it is it was hard to find them the basement of the link mall was super hard to find i wish there were better street signs\",\"the dumplings with truffles are out of this world highly recommended cannot wait to be back in singapore again\",\"what is all the fuss about of all the delicious hawker centers countless restaurants in chinatown why eat in a basement mall quick service meh ambience and just ok dim sum ok tom cruise has been there but i am going back to chinatown next time\",\"excellent food the veg dumplings are awesome one of the best the la lian is very good as well but be prepared to stand in the queue during lunch time it is very crowded\",\"super expensive for what you get but not bad in terms of soup dumplings i have had better though but this is good for a quick bite\",\"my favorite restaurant and food in asia apart from ajisen ramen really love their salads fried rice and of course their very famous dumplings specially xiaolongbao the best and you can watch them making your dumplings so interesting and cool must go must see and must try we also loved their seaweed salad vegetable dumplings steamed veggies and one of my favorites vegetable and tofu salad does not sound that great but tastes amazing\",\"odd to admit this but this din tai fung location was yummier than my local joint here in arcadial what is the difference i want to say it might be the asian meat they use shrug it is just everything is just a slight notch yummier the restaurant itself is so clean service is quick if you are in singapore make sure to swing by i know it is a bit pricier than the other options esp those hawker stands but it is worth your time money enjoy\",\"xian long boa freshly made dumplings from pork to veggie fillings these are definitely must have when you are in singapore you can get either pcs or pcs prices varied from  sd to  sd it really depends on fillings while you are waiting you can even watch and learn the art of the chef is craft just expect a long queue\",\"tasty food good service ambiance is not ideal it is in the basement food court of a mall\",\"this place is so addicting many things have been said about their classic pork dumplings but they really are the best the dough is not too thick or too thin the meat is a perfect flavour and the dumplings are steamed to perfection little balls of heaven i also love their fried rice the egg fried rice is the best i have had yet and tastes perfect i have fruitlessly tried to get good basic fried rice and have found that this place does it best the garlic chili wantons are great as well and come in a very tasty dark chili sauce they also have a small variety of vegetables which are enhanced by some garlic sauce and taste very good i have tried the other varieties of dumplings such as the vegetable ones and the pork and shrimp they are good but in my opinion the classic pork ones are the best the vegetable ones seem a bit dry and the pork shrimp ones have very thick dough the food comes super fast when you are eating in and of course seems to take longer when you are waiting for it as a take away i am super addicted and do not mind the wait because they make everything fresh regarding the setting it is located in marina bay link mall so basically in an underground tunnel which is also a shopping centre with various shops cafes its not the most relaxing ambiance but i very much doubt people seek this place out for the amazing setting the food makes it worth it and the restaurant itself is big enough where you can feel a bit removed if you do not sit right by the window overall great food and consistent quality\",\"having now permanently move to singapore din tai fung is now my to go place for a quick xiao long bao fix it is not the best xia long bao i have ever tasted honestly i think crystal jade is xiao long bao is better but i love their other chinese dishes as well like dumpling in vinegar chili sauce and fried rice cos let is be honest i do not know about you but for me eating xiao long bao alone for a meal will never made me satisfied yeah yeah i know i am a girl with a big appetite and i like varieties i love that though din tai fung is a chain restaurant but they always maintain their standard really well the food taste wise is always consistent service is okay not bad but def could be improved please keep in mind that dtf is always crowded so come at weird hours like   pm or   pm if you want to avoid long queue they take reservation if you have  people or more in your group\",\"the service at sushi bar was great with an extremely polite and conscientious staff decor of the location was very intimate but also great for larger groups came here on my birthday and ordered tuna sashimi comes with three large pieces of raw fish crab stick roll and the salmon aburi all of the sushi tasted fresh and was of high quality for a fair price they even put a little candle on the sushi so i kinda had to give it  stars would definitely recommend\",\"oh this was a great choice to come here it is not easy to find as it is inside the mall and the numbering of stores is hard to figure out but looking for it is worth it i had the california roll very nice the salmon aburi wow and the spicy tuna another wow everything tasted so good and i enjoyed my time here a lot the cold sake was also a good choice\",\"i came here whilst on a business trip circa  i happened upon this establishment one night i ordered two rolls and a coke no sugar formerly known as coke zero the rolls were quite delicious my bill was  for just myself which is sort of a rip off but singapore is kind of a rip off itself since i put this meal on my expense report and was reimbursed in full i did not not ding them a star for the high price should i visit singapore again and stay at the not so grand hyatt i may return here for some sushi\",\"sometimes the hard to find the out of the way the small places are the very best i am an aficionado of sushi sashimi and i was very pleased with my order here at sushi bar this is the first time i found blue fin tuna in a sushi restaurant yes it is pricey but wow what a difference excellent i also ordered the kodai sushi and it was excellent\",\"good prices but fish not really that fresh think the taka outlet is way better which is strange as they should use the same supplier good and friendly service though\",\"omg yelp let me down big time i do not know how this place can be rated    stars i am pretty sure you can get much better sushi at costco and better cuts of fish at any isetan japanese market i was pretty excited to dine here since it was located at the far east plaza right next to the hotel so it was pretty effortless to get here after work the sushi bar is located on the th floor of this less than glam shopping plaza where merchants stand outside their shops preying on walker bys it kinda reminds me of an indoor flea market with roll up doors where they sell lots of shimmering cheap stretch pants and battery operated clapping toys i was convinced that the sushi bar was just a gem located inside this  is time warped mall i sat down and ordered some green tea the  kind sashimi and the hamachi kama which they warn you takes  min to prepare my first disappointment was the tea bag i expect it from a mr sushi or a sushi food truck but this place was a    star establishment man my dish of  pcs of sashimi quickly showed up the first bite of the swordfish was like biting into a cold tough piece of goodyear tire there was no way my incisors could completely penetrate that nearly inch thick piece of white radial i quickly moved to the other fish and none were impressive at all either the octopus was not appealing either with the big suckers staring at me the grilled hamachi cheek was the only thing that somewhat saved this place from being a  star it was good but still not great another thing i noticed was the lack of hygene in the handling of the soy sauce dishes the guy stuck his thumb right on the top surface of where people pour their soy sauce some people may not care or pay attention to details like this but this germaphobe wo not be returning here they set the sushi bar way too low to be enjoyed by this foodie\",\"this place is hidden on the th floor if you are in the mood for sushi this place is perfect no wait yesterday at  pm the sushi is delicious service impeccable\",\"ebi fry salmon aburizal    starsnot very flavourful just decent the sushi at aburi sushi heishirou at westgate was better and cheaper although it is kind of out of the way the place is also rather crowded so it is not great for a nice quiet dinner\",\"heard that this was the best sushi joint in singapore so we had to try the restaurant was extremely hard to find no one knew where it was and we were misdirected  times before we finally found it on the th floor once we got in we were quickly seated and the servers promptly gave us tea and took our orders they were very friendly and helpful giving us suggestions on what to order and portion control we ordered a small sashimi sampler  rolls from the chefs recommendation menu and wagyu aburi sushi best idea ever the sashimi was super thick and delicious but i have to say my fav was the wagyu melt on your tongue aburi sushi and the scallop roll made the trip well worth if you have a couple if hours to kill and an urge to go on an adventure give this place a try itll for sure satisfy your starving stomach after the treacherous journey to get here\",\"fresh fish generous portions fast professional service a reasonable price what more can you ask for my husband and i went here based on a yelp suggestion that popped up on my screen and it was a block away from my hotel so how could i say no it was a little bit challenging to find it because it is all the way in the back of the mall and the mall directory needs to be updated with its listing but after we found it and waited in line it was so worth it i had the normal churasi don plate which was a nice selection of fish including salmon smoked salmon tuna scallop egg salmon roe and another one i cannot remember all are top quality and generously sized pieces husband had the smoked salmon roll some salmon sushi and two hand rolls the hand rolls were like deconstructed cut rolls with a twist if you want to go exotic and get premium sashimi you can do this here too check out the premium and seasonal donburi selections very impressive for such a low key place\",\"yes i also get the raving reviews now we decided to pop in on a saturday night after the gym protein and were lucky to find only a few people queuing so we got a table in no time and ordered scallop carpaccio agedashi tofu sashimi and a seasonal chirashi don the fish was amazing the tofu bowl the broth especially was very tasty and the scallop carpaccio divine i found my favourite beer suntory premium and the service was very friendly and fast the interior is modern but more on the functional side anyhow you do not come here for the furnishings you come here for sushi i would not take a first date or celebrate my anniversary here but i will certainly be back for their delectable sushi and good service at a price tag that does not involve cringing when you see the bill\",\"ars you looking for value for money sushi in a restaurant that takes restaurants looking for a decently priced pint of beer to cool off the sushi bar is your place for all three of the above reasons love that you can sms them to make a reservation queues can get long so definitely make a reservation if you know you will be headed there the chirashi bowl is my go to item on the menu with a nice cold asahi or sapporo of course\",\"i was taken here for dinner on a monday night and we got here before pm so there was not a queue there is a promotion where you get  rolls for the price of  and my companion by some oversight ordered the prawn soft shell crab and salmon rolls which all happened to be aburi ed i loved the rolls but three aburi ed rolls which sort of taste the same after a while for  people are a bit much and hence we struggled to finish the rolls which resulted in a fair bit of waste we also got the normal chirashi a portion of salmon sashimi a pitan tofu the chirashi was topped with thickly sliced fish of various varieties and the rice was sufficiently vinegared yum my favorite was the pitan tofu tofu is actually a misnomer as they use egg custard as the tofu and then top it with century eggs flying fish roe spring onions and shredded surimi i really liked this prices here are very reasonable for what they are i guess this is the singapore version of hole in the wall sushi tucked in a corner of orchard road they should probably have a sake shot promo just to value add\",\"i did not know about this place until a yelper recommended it the word sushi was an immediately yes when she suggested having our dinner there no regrets at all hidden on the th floor of far east plaza a mall that needs some upgrading to compete with its rivals my first impression of the place is this must be a low cost type japanese restaurant as its interior and menu matches to my impression but the cost of the food is at a different level i ordered the normal chirashi set a bowl of rice with a mixture of assorted meat that cost  to try out since i was told how good the food is when my meal was served my eyes popped out when i saw the portion of the meat it is probably the most generous portion i come across in singapore so far my first bite of it has made me craved for more while engaging a conversation with my friend i cannot help but to enjoy every bite of it multi tasking at the same time eating  and listening  it was that enjoyable i had the chawamushi steamed egg and that is pretty decent so for the  i paid for the meal it is certainly worth the enjoyment like they say sometimes it is good to spend more for good food this is one example\",\"i am never a big fan of aburi as i have yet to taste one which made me sit up and go wow until now the aburi salmon sushi is fabulous you can taste the smokiness of the seared salmon and it is not too overpowering the sushi has a good balance of fish and rice the presentation is good the premium chirashi is equally satisfying lots of fresh seafood and too little rice though the amount is just right to fill you up the premium chirashi has seasonal items uni prawn and maybe others which are not included in the regular chirashi and so is the price mine was   which i felt was reasonable given the  pieces of uni and sheer quantity of fish i loved the aburi salmon and salmon belly in it it is crowded during lunch time so you will need to wait to get a table they lost our reservation though so we took the counter seats until a table was free for a small place there are  people in the tiny kitchen slicing and dicing and cleaning it is a decent no frills sushi bar focusing on fresh and good food i will go back again oh you can also request for fresh wasabi which is  extra it is definitely better than the usual wasabi which is made from powder paste\",\"nice place for quality sushi business is good so it is advisable to make a reservation one of the speciality is the soft shell crab with salmon roll the salmon is torched so this dish is suitable for diners who are not into raw food the ingredients go well together the unagi avocado roll was a rip off in my opinion i understand that unagi is not cheap but not a lot of it was given and  pieces of sushi at   before tax were not worth it the other sushi rolls had more portions and value for money only cash or nets is accepted\",\"oh the sushi bar you had me at hello the sushi here is among the most mouthwatering and freshest you will find on the red dot furthermore it wo not break the bank either with the normal chirashi coming in at c sgd i am a rice and sashimi kind of guy hence my lifetime obsession with chirashi sashimi on a bed of rice the chirashi comes with an eclectic assortment of fish including salmon aburi salmon my personal fav tuna yellowtail swordfish scallop fish roe and tomago the fish portions are thick so you wo not feel short changed after finishing the dish my only complaint if any was the small layer of rice underneath the sashimi i am a huge sushi rice eater so this could be a personal complaint fortunately this was easily remedied by ordering an extra order of rice i am a huge fan of the sushi bar almost to the point of obsession the lines are long but it is worth the wait trust me\",\"stars for above average food at a price that is hard to beat the normal chiraishi comes with salmon aburi salmon tuna swordfish yellowtail and scallops they are really generous with the ingredients you get  thick slices of each quality wise i thought that it was on par with more expensive places like sushi tei or itacho sushi everyone orders the aburi salmon rolls and with good reason these were fantastic the salmon was perfectly seared and came in thick slices and the mentaiko mayo on the top of the rolls complemented the rest of the ingredients well for both dishes the fish rice ratio was   which was impressive considering that it is usually the reverse in similarly priced places wasabi was better than the usual but lacked the clears your nose immediately spiciness of the freshest kinds i should know because i put a teaspoon of it into my mouth and did not die i was here at pm on a weekday and it was empty none of the crazy queue that everyone is been talking about i do not usually do things like these it was part of a bet\",\"hole in the wall shop that is a hidden gem in fep came here to celebrate my friend is birthday and the food far exceeded my expectations there is a long line outside and all parties must be present to be seated but it is quite worth the wait they just opened a new outlet on level  of the same building but offers only  of the menu we opted to wait for a table and it only took min on a sat night at pm the salmon and salmon belly sashimi are generously sliced and rather fresh the famed salmon aburi roll did not disappoint while the sirloin steak was tender juicy fragrant and perfectly grilled it reminds me of the steak at new ubin seafood which i absolutely love we also had the upgraded miso soup some salmon fish head soup which was very sweet enjoyed my dinner very much and definitely looking forward to coming back again\",\"i would like to give   stars we had daikon salad fish miso soup udon seasonal chirashi and premium chirashi we loved all of the dishes except daikon salad chirashi was really good for this quality i think it is reasonable i just wish they would take credit card\",\"in singapore for a little business and asked the concierge at the royalpark hotel on beach street for a lunch suggestion within walking distance without hesitation he asked if i like french me oui he recommended the set lunch which is also know back in the states as pre fixe out the door i went and it was about a  min walk super easy to find i got there around   on a tuesday and the place was about half full and i was immediately seated the set lunch is an amazing deal with  courses appetizer main desert for s  i ordered the escargot the duck confit and chocolate ice cream also on the set lunch menu you can add a glass of house pour wine red or white for an additional s  there were  escargot smothered in yummy garlic butter parsley sauce it was piping hot and so delicious served with some french bread slices to soak up all that leftover butter sauce wow the suck was everything i hoped for super crispy skin that actually cracked when you cut into it and fall aparty succulent duck it was served on a bed of oh so smooth mashed potatoes with mushrooms and a pan sauce on the side like i said before yummy the ice cream was a so rich just  scoop is all you need to satisfy your sweet tooth especially for lunch this place was legit french cuisine and the set price lunch is a steal of a bargain especially in singapore swing in by for lunch you can thank me later\",\"i always make it a habit to seek out a french restaurant whenever i travel to another country ever since i had my first meal at cafe des artistes in manhattan at the age of  i have had a love for french cuisine while searching on yelp saveur came up on top after reading a few reviews what jumped out at me was when i read one reviewer say that you will not get an amazing prix fixe of  per person anywhere else in singapore other items are offered if you want to go off the prix fixe menu the place has stark white walls high ceilings and nice pop music playing in the background sing along if you want i did the place offers a nice acoustic the prix fixe menu offers a choice of an app entree and dessert my party of three got to sample each other is dishes here are a few of the dishes that really stood out escargot app foie gras app beef cheeks entree beef en croute entree creme brle dessert pistachio baileys panna cotta dessert here are my only two complaints the staff are the only people in singapore that we have encountered that were not as chatty they did not smile and were very robotic a bit surprising since everybody in sg seem overly friendly i read a review back in  and he said the same thing i guess the same staff has been working here for a long time my chicken dish was very dry the sauce had a bitter taste to it and did not go well with the chicken huge disappointment all in all if you are looking for french cuisine i highly recommend this place just do not expect the staff to smile at you\",\"went here for a team event we had around  people the atmosphere is nothing fancy but tastefully designed and comfortable they have got some white walls and exposed white brick in certain areas overall nice aesthetics the menu has a great selection of various deliciousness ranging from lobster to foie gras for those less adventurous they have some pasta dishes with french fries whatever your taste you should not have any issues finding something delightfully tasty at this restaurant i had the lamb shank it was one of the most delicious meals i have ever had it was also a photogenic dish see below i have been with large groups dining at a restaurant and have seen the presentation suffer as a result of having to make multiple of the same dish that was not the case here the kitchen staff evidently takes pride in every dish that exits those kitchen doors great job the only thing i would approve is offering a more eclectic beer selection perhaps a craft beer or two with such a diverse and fanciful menu they should put more range on their drink selection great job\",\"organised a group lunch restaurant decor is pretty and clean is not noisy staff passable service maybe a little slow but still polite food was good my frds had the duck confit they liked it i had the truffle mushroom soup i like it food delivery time from kitchen to us was ok too given it was not packed during lunch hour will go back again\",\"food is so so price is quite affordable service staffs are not as friendly actually not impressive\",\"saveur serves excellent french food at a very fair price   for a  course set meal over lunch or   for dinner i found the mushroom soup duck main course and pistachio dessert to be particularly excellent i also tried the pasta sea bass and creme brle sharing with a friend those were good too but not as exceptional no wait if you go right when they open at pm for lunch and pm for dinner would absolutely return here for another meal\",\"as much as i like the idea of french cuisine becoming more accessible this did not really do it for me i know it is singapore but i found the service a bit absent and when the woman brought over my beer she did a terrible pour into a glass all head spilling way over onto the table she put down the beer bottle and walked off while i watched as it foamed everywhere no one grabbed a cloth for the table or glass no one apologised and i just waited in vain for it to settle food was a bit bland duck rillette was fine though accompanying bread was over oily main of fish was a reasonable size but again bland and felt unbalanced small fish steak too many potatoes not enough veges food did come fast though like i said wanted to like but walked away feeling unsatisfied maybe you need that extra level of care to make french food shine\",\"we have since come back to this bistro many times for lunches and dinners over the years visiting singapore and we have enjoyable experience every time we just cannot get enough of its scrumptious duck confit among others especially with a glass of its house cab the food quality remains high service is adequate the price is slightly higher now but still of great value read on if interested peter apr this charming bistro is a gem it is conveniently located on purvis nearby the library and not far from the intercontinental hotel and the raffles hotel locals love it and try to keep it a secret tourists must go there and enjoy with its great food at value prices be prepared for a long wait but totally worth it go early its signiture duck confit is a must try this restaurant has an eye pleasing and comfortable caf style decor it offers a nice selection of tasty dishes at low prices s   beer and wine are expensive in singapore in general we found that its house cabinet sauvignon by the glass  goes well with the duck confit our local friends told us about this nice place last thur evening my wife and i got there well before pm the place was already almost full most of the diners were young folks we were lucky to get a table we had its famous duck confit seabass duck salad home fried potato cubes and a very small bottle of beer the duck confit was absolutely delicious however the seabass was way too bland and the fish was not firm the salad and potatos were tasty the service was not great but adequate when we left around pm the place was packed and there was a long waiting line outside we will definitely go back there and try other items on their menu before leaving singapore legend has it that the original saveur was a hawker in food court type of establishment after it was moved to the current location and became a nice french bistro its owner still keeps the prices and his profit low how nice of him its young chef has reportedly worked in top french restaurants wow i envy singapore people and especially their young yelpers peterskis jan\",\"first impressions are so so anticipation had deflated as was so looking forward to eating at this establishment since it is been highly recommended by friends food was generally delish had the set dinner at   is quite reasonable started with the foie gras for appetizer followed by beef bourguignon as mains and chocolate with hazelnut sauce for dessert my friend ordered the angel hair pasta for  way sharing and loved it the foie gras lentils combination was a pleasant start lightly salted to balance the palate the beef was extremely tender an easy bite the stew was not too thick which i liked dessert was lovely though would liked more hazelnut sauce perhaps i was expecting too much though the food did not disappoint the service was barely there perhaps it was just a very casual dining place where service was kept at a minimal perhaps perhaps\",\"the good the price of food and wine is extremely low although there is much better french food to be had in singapore it is very good given the low cost the tenderloin and boeuf bourguignon are pretty good the pork belly less so for the money the pasta appetizer and the potatos au gratin are very good the rillette not so much the bad no ambiance to speak of my first impression was that of a loud canteen i found it disconcerting to order using a paper form like you would see at a dim sum restaurant it is really loud it is hard to have a conversation or speak with the server even when the restaurant is only at half capacity let alone when it is near full the service is ok i think the service shortcomings are more because the restaurant is under staffed rather than rude or neglectful the wine list is shockingly brief two whites two reds the cabernet sauvignon was good for what it cost  we tried three different desserts the panna cotta the lava cake and the milk cookies unlike the appetizers and mains i think the desserts were quite poor with the milk cookies perhaps mediocre saveur has clearly identified its target market it is pretty well packed at dinner that said i do not think i would go back personally i would rather pay more and have a nicer quieter setting with better food\",\"very nice food for the price will be one of my favs i think mushroom soup was probably my least favorite but loved the duck confit pasta etcthe venue is definitely loud but i think he wants it to be a casual place with it plastic seats and loud music it is still charming though\",\"my friend brought me to this french restaurant and was disappointed to find out that the standard had dropped business did not seem good and we soon figured out why the french onion soup was not available which had happened during my friend is previous visit too our mains sea bass and duck confit came across as being cooked way in advance and just heated up when a customer places an order hope the place buck up and revive its glory\",\"i really wanted to like this place s   for a  course meal great value in sg for sure however the food was mediocre and left no lasting impression the place is packed and loud it was almost as if i walked into a french version of caf de coral\",\"best meal ever under  get here at pm or be prepared to wait in line the wife and i ate here twice  glasses of wine  duck salads  main dishes and a desert for  sgd the pork belly is done very well crispy skin moist meat tons of flavor everything was so good all the tables around us got the duck confit so it must be good wine was very good for  a glass a little small the chocolate hazelnut mouse was one of the best things i have ever eaten dense cold great flavor covered in frozen raspberries and rice crispy is for texture must order\",\"i was in charge of picking a place for dinner so my favorite thing to do of course is find a place on yelp this place was only  blocks from our hotel we got here around  and there were lots of people waiting outside the hostess said it would be a   minute wait so we waited she would of called us when our table was ready but we did not have a phone we looked over the menu so we could order when we sat down wow the prices are amazing we ordered  foie gras since we cannot get it in ca we also ordered the pasta dish i got the duck confit and my husband got the beef tenderloin omg the foie gras was really good it melts in your mouth i preferred the one over lentils instead of the ones over apples the pasta dish was simple but had tons of flavor i liked how it had little bright pink dried shrimps on top of the pasta my duck confit arrived and we started eating that wow it was really good the duck was perfectly seasoned my husbands entree arrived and we tired his and it was good too we asked for medium but should have asked for medium rare it came out medium well but it was still good we finished our meals and decided to try the tofu cheesecake for dessert wow that was good too this is a great place for date night and good on the pocket too\",\"i wo not say this is the perfect place to sample french food given the chop chop fast manner they serve the food and the lengthy queues you have to endure to get a seat the french way of dining is to relax enjoy and not to get your blood pressure up we headed over to the place at around  pm as the place opens at pm and they do not take reservations to our surprise there was already a queue of around  people and counting we joined the queue and was amused as there were more and more people commenting how surprised they were to see such a long queue when the place has not even opened yet finally at pm sharp the doors opened i felt like i was queuing to buy hello kitty or jay chou tickets we were seated promptly and in an orderly fashion hence our queuing neighbours in front and behind us got seated on our right and left respectively there was a mad rush to be the first one to place your order and i can already see the chefs hard at work preparing some of the more popular dishes i waved for the waitress to come over to take our order and she promptly did so the waitress frantically took our order much to the chagrin of the lady at the next table as she expected that it was common sense that the waitress turned around to take her order too anyway our order came pretty fast and we were generally satisfied with the meal which was affordable as well verdict forgive me as i forgot the name of the dish saveur is pasta apparently this is one of the more famous appetizers that people will order we ordered the main portion size and boy was it good beef cheeks with baked potatoes and musclun salad the  beef cubes though not as huge as i hoped for was so tender it literally melted in my mouth every bite was heaven the baked potatoes had all the comfort y goodness you can ask for though i must say that the dish itself is very fattening onion soup cannot compare to what we had in paris but i found the broth a tad too sweet for my liking overall plenty of onion bits to chew on dessert i cannot remember the name of the dessert but the waitress encouraged us to order this dish which she claimed to be have ry popular and takes  mins to make you should order this as once it is sold out there is no more see my picture for clarity very very nice dessert apologies again for the lack of a name tip expect to queue for at least  mins if you want to dine here do not expect to be served immediately or for the waitress to read your mind to head over to take your order common restaurant rules still apply expect to eat in a chop chop fast manner aka like order eat pay thank you mam style\",\"affordable done right cannot complain the prices are all very reasonable for the area and i really appreciate the restaurant is efforts at giving customers a affordable way to taste great food quite a big fan of most of the starters soups and mains mushroom soup was delicious compared to the heavy cream based nonsense you usually tend to get elsewhere the duck confit was also pretty delicious and from what it seems is a crowd pleaser i personally loved the ebi shrimp and spaghetti starter as well super flavourful value for money for sure looking to enjoy some good quality food without breaking the bank this is the place\",\"ok it is ok la tried the usual crowd favorites and they are decent but nothing mindblowing i can see this as a place among the youngsters for their date nights haha i find the servings really small that is how they keep their pricing low i supposed the foie gras came in hardly more than two bite size ok it is less than  but if you size it up the normal restaurant size it is not that much cheaper than the other places two of us ended up eating two appetizers two main course and two desserts it did not end up being a very cheap affair ultimately good effort by local young people who graduated from our own shatec though i wish them the best\",\"guess how i found out about this place ding ding time is up here is the answer i got attracted by the long queue while crossing the road to bugis no seriously that was precisely how i found out about saveur i was like what the hell is with that queue and i dragged my poor boyfriend over to the crowd french food pfft that does not explain the queue then i saw the menu and everything became crystal clear duck confit for  are my eyes deceiving me i googled nope it is true it is actually affordable affordable french food somehow does not click but saveur made sure it did after a few unsuccessful attempts at trying to get in and eventually resigning to a certain golden arch fast food nearby for a meal the boyfriend and i did the unimaginable we went to saveur half an hour before opening hours to ensure we get in and we finally did so was the food worth the hype here was what we ordered the foie gras now do not go thinkin animal cruelty and all that it is not everyday i am getting foie gras at less than  with lentils was salty yes that was it salty but at less than  i am not complaining i will only be pissed if it was going for  what you pay for is what you will get after that my duck confit came ok granted it was on the smallish side but like what i mentioned before the price the taste of it for someone like me who hates the taste of duck i polished it off right down to the bone so i will say it is swell then the dessert of blood orange jelly came again it was on the small side one bite into it i swear if it was not indecent i would have orgasm on the spot what on earth the taste to me it was orgasmic a definite must try all in all was the food worth the hype the taste i will say it is average but the price yes it is definitely worth the hype if you are looking to go on a budget just remember though what you pay for is what you will get so do not be expecting too much from this place\",\"i am a fan for such amazing taste french food with affordable price looking at the logo of the restaurant a duck i assume the duck is their specialty so i ordered the confit duck with orange the portion is just nice completed by the orange sweetness mushroom and mashed potato the duck dish is perfect highly recommended i tried the sea bass too and it is very delicious as well the place is quite big they even have spare room just next to it if more people come or for special reservations i came there with my parents to celebrate my mom is birthday so when i booked online i wrote my special request to have a birthday cake served for her at the end of our dinner the staff is very nice and they really make it happen the birthday cake turn out to be a chocolate mousse cake withe a written chocolate happy birthday on the plate wow very kind of them and they gave it as complimentary not to mention that the chocolate mousse taste very good too it is one of their desserts yumm for the dish yumm for the dessert i am satisfied and blessed\",\"fresh bagels made everyday worth it for its price a bagel and coffee works perfectly on a sunny weekday\",\"my fav bagel place in singapore at this location i like the spam bagel i recommend adding a hash brown usually i do that for my husband cos he loves hash browns but it is good enough on its own i also like the avocado one sofrito and add a slice of bacon if you feel like it otherwise i go for the blueberry bagel with fruits my go to breakfast place in my hood\",\"been to their other branch thought try this one since its focus is smoked tried the primal and ribs and both were wonderful though the ribs was a little too spicy coffees were wonderful as usual only issue was the order payment was slow otherwise q as usual even before the store opens\",\"i have to say i was skeptical coming from nyc we know good bagels and this place really delivered excellent bagels got a cheddar bagel with scallion cream cheese and my husband got the whammer on a garlic bagel and both were great definitely recommend\",\"eighteen days into a three week swing through asia i was done with hotel breakfast buffets i wanted a breakfast that had not been under a warming light or in a steam tray fortunately when i checked into the delightful courtyard by marriott novena the young lady at the bell desk on the ground floor told me i had to try this place given that it was about  steps from the front door this was a no brainer this was just what i needed and more the bagel at  am was still warm from the oven and the schmears were cool and tasty the menu told me that i was coming back and tomorrow i am buying for the office two men bagel house has redefined the quick breakfast in singapore as long as they are here i am staying nearby\",\"it is my first time in singapore so i do not really know a lot of places to eat thankfully i have yelp to help me out i ordered the kuzu bagel and it was very delicious i also like their unique maneki neko\",\"waited  minutes for them to open and it was definitely worth the wait got a breakfast bagel that was phenomenal very friendly staff too\",\"this place is great before you ever order your food drink you are greeted by a happy friendly helpful staff the bagels are fresh and delicious they make them fresh each morning there are all sorts of choices to make a sandwich or just have a topping or two the coffee is delicious as well my only regret is not having eaten here sooner we ate breakfast here before heading to the airport if i am ever back in singapore i will make a point to come back here\",\"when coffee meets bagels coffee we have plenty in sg bagels well they are indeed rare and hard to find good coffee yesgood bagels probably the best in sg and for coffee to meet bagels here in novena automatic  stars when they first popped up in tanjong pagar many yelpers were lavishing mouthwatering praise our previous cm michelle even got them to tie up with the new black for a yelp event and all who attended were sold on how good they are and craved for more that culminated in us holding a subsequent uye brunch at their tp location not so long after cold retarded no not you the dough handrolled boiled in honey water flavoured and then tanned in the oven on site for a freshness that cannot escape the bite need something extra toasted and schmeared for extra taste and texture still looking for that something extra the legends and the breakfast club configurations will take that to the next level be it savoury or sweet meaty or plant loving there is something fishy too nicely stacked halved and wrapped maximum enjoyment minimum messiness a favourite with the expats and millenials non airconditioned but who needs it with the recent cold spells in sg the staff will definitely warm you up with their cool attitude and infectious friendliness my only wish is for the onion and garlic flavours to make it is way here from enggor st and the coffee meets bagel experience will be complete\",\"a rather refreshing take to bagels never thought bagels could be so savoury and so wholesome love the bagel with spam tastes amazing with all the luncheon meat goodness thumbs up also to their in house roasted meats the birdie chicken bagel was incredible fragrantly roasted and well seasoned the meat platter had very generous portions and all of it together formed a very heavy lunch that filled us to the brink just wished that we did not have to go back to work with such a full stomach after that the mango smoothie deserves a special mention for it is refreshing taste with just the right amount of sweet and chill to balance the meaty tastes all set in a casual alfresco dining experience for cosy chit chat with friends enjoyable\",\"amazing bagels i have never actually had any other bagels in singapore so i feel pretty comfortable saying that these must be the best that the island has to offer i normally always spring for the lox bagel but the menu is so inventive and interesting that i decided to try something a little different the hawaiian bagel spam chutney egg sriracha aioli greens no cheese for me because i really do not like it all on an onion bagel it was easily was of the messiest bagels i have ever eaten but also one of the best comparable to the one i have had in new york just everything was perfect the onion bagel was crispy and just the perfect amount of onion the spam chutney etc combination was really great and tasty everything tasted fresh which is weird to say about spam but you know everything else tasted fresh i was kind of sad my bagel was over i know i mentioned their menu was interesting but i definitely feel it warrants another mention i have not gone to a bagel place with such a wide offering it is usually pretty boring typical stuff but two men bagel house offers so much more i mean corn chowder soup bagel like what even give me some of that and who the hell does not want to eat something called hot mess i legit wish i had more time to stick around and try something else i almost forgot to say though you order up front and then grab a seat the staff at the counter were hilarious as well cracking jokes with us really great service and made for a good atmosphere\",\"highly recommend not a big fan of bagels but this little place changed that no doubt it was made just a few minutes earlier it was so fresh just wish i would have discovered them when i first got here instead of on my last day here coffee beans were fresh and very flavourful they use a local roaster and the roast date for your coffee is shown mine was within the last  days so just about perfect to top it off every staff member was super nice and accommodating a rarity it seems breakfast lunch or dinner would be great here\",\"what caught my eye about this place was the honey and ricotta spread i love honey and i love ricotta but i have never thought to put them together on a bagel the taste was absolutely mouthwatering and the ice peppermint tea i will be back for\",\"still the best bagels in singapore this one alongside their other location in my old stomping grounds in tanjong pagar serve the only bagels in singapore that i consistently come back to highly recommend you come here for any bagel craving you have as you really wo not find any better on the island the location is pretty cool all outdoor or bar like seating they do not take credit cards so be wary of that only cash and nets\",\"had the primal and lamb bagel for someone that is not hugely into bagels my verdict is well i loved it they were huge and cut in half so my wife and i were able to try both coffee was good had a long black they have cold pressed juice and everything was ready in a little over  minutes people working there were nice and friendly\",\"awesome bagels thank you we love coming to this shop especially the bagel and lox or the bbq\",\"went there yesterday and this place is legit although i am a goy so take this with a grain of salt speaking of salt the lox was not salted but was piled deliciously high on your choice of bagel along with tomato onions cucumbers cream cheese and capers seating is outside only covered coffee was good but not great right next to the courtyard entrance\",\"i had the primal bagel and it was delicious the bagel was soft the staff were friendly and explained to me in details since it was my first time eating there\",\"bunch here is supposedly legendary so i went and had the chicken and waffles and was not disappointed i prefer the dinner selection though regardless of meal time get their house made burrata you will only be able to say wow after he first bite trust me it is a very casual hipster atmosphere with a short wine list sit outside on a nice night or inside if you have a group the bar tables inside are not comfortable however\",\"it just was not as good as i remembered most of the dishes were not memorable bag of turkish bread    starsthe bread tasted great but there were only about  small pieces per bag so we needed maybe    bags per person which adds up also makes me wonder why we have to keep ordering bread hummus iraqi spiced mushrooms    starsone of the better dishes spinach labneh fried onions sugar plum   starshonestly nothing special tasted like creamed spinach but not a very flavourful version either crab toast chicken crackling trout roe   starsthis was disappointing two tiny macaron sized pieces with a filling that tasted too much like salmon spread from a tin fried cauliflower mango amba pine nuts red cabbage    starsone of the best dishes of the night the cauliflower was deliciously salted and breaded and the dressing was tasty cuttlefish shawarma chicken fat dressing lime    starsthe texture of the cuttlefish was excellent not too rubbery and grilled just right but how is a chicken fat dressing anything less than flavourful green harissa prawns split cream charred onions    starsthis came with four large prawns cooked right and a delicious spicy harissa that was wonderful for dipping bread into malabi ruby peach pudding bergamot ice white chocolate    starsthe flavours just did not go well together the white chocolate on top seemed gimmicky and the bergamot was too sour i enjoyed the pudding but it was par for the course date pudding smoked milk cashew caramel coffee jelly   starsthe date pudding was delicious and so was the crunchy cashew caramel on top i enjoyed the coffee jelly yes but it seemed a little out of place we tried to make a reservation for a saturday night but they were fully booked so we walked in at  pm and managed to get a table i called multiple times and wish their automated voice system online system would show that they were fully booked i was not sure if it was not taking same day reservations or if it was fully booked\",\"went for dinner on a weekday great vibe and great music most importantly great food everything we had was delicious so i will simply list everything we had and all dishes are best to be shared for mezze we had babaganoush paired with the pita bread rich but yummy had some cured swordfish and fresh figs with goat cheese which were both really refreshing would suggest ordering mezze to start they are small dishes for   people for sides we had the feta burrata broccoli salad and the green beans and beet could pass on these but it is nice to have veggies since all the other dishes are so rich for mains we had the duck tacos which was messy to eat but yummy and filling the hot skillet prawns are a must the lamb shoulder dish was rich and yummy but filling and definitely for sharing we got hot tea which actually worked so well with our meal because it helped cut the rich flavors between dishes i definitely recommend this place and would go again and maybe try their weekend brunch do not forget to make reservations\",\"really really good mediterranean inspired food at this cozy and rustic restaurant the main entrance is directly opposite fortune center the yellow and white building along middle road and you have to walk in to a courtyard before you can see reservation counter of the restaurant the courtyard is beautiful with a lot of plants and a couple of tables if you fancy an al fresco dining experience and enough blood to donate to the mosquito community if you are coming from the side door it is just next to torte caf the brownie is to die for at the end of waterloo street i have dined at artichoke a couple of times both on weekend brunch and dinner and always had the best time here for brunch you need to come for their mezza platter perfect for  which consist of  mezze usually babaganoush hummus beetroot and smoked salmon and a few slices of toasted bread i suspect they rub the toasted bread with garlic hence making it really delicious and addictive one portion is never enough all the time for dinner last night we had the usual mezze plates of hummus babaganoush and beetroot while getting a roasted lemon chicken burrata and deep fried cauliflower to share all the mains were delicious and i wished we ordered second or third of the burrata i can eat burrata everyday the deep fried cauliflower was amazing too the best i have tried in singapore after pony dining in eagle strret pier brisbane flavors were spot on accompanied by chick peas and pomegranate for that extra texture heaven the grilled lemon chicken is moist and tender what makes it so special is the garlic puree no kissing after eating this so you have been forewarned that elevates the flavor of the chicken with a squeeze of lemon juice on it do check out the blackboard for weekly specials if you are into trying something new i have heard people complaint about the price being not wallet friendly here well i think it all depends on what you order and how you order they have their best seller the lambgasm a  kg bone in lamb shoulder slow roasted with assorted condiments selling at  so of course if you order this coupled with a few mains plus cocktails the bill will definitely come up to   the four of us ordered  mezze plates  mains with no drinks and we paid a total of   each last night considering the food we ate the price was relatively cheap and reasonable and we walked out from the restaurant feeling just nice not extremely full or bloated and very satisfied with dinner it can get very pack during weekend brunch and dinner so call in and make reservation to avoid any disappointment\",\"beautiful beautiful food beautiful presentation beautiful ambiance this take on middle eastern joint is a wonderful vegetable forward place to take all the visiting yuppies in your life they replaced my cauliflower sabbich with brussel sprouts which i did not mind in the least bit it comes with this delightfully soft cooked egg that has an oozing yolk when you pierce it my cousin visiting from ny got the lamb shakshouka and his gf got the salmon pancake all of it looked and tasted amazing one star off because we dined outside where the only relief from the heat was a fan and some shade by the end of the meal the three of us americans had wilted oh and p s it was a  minute wait at pm on sunday\",\"visited at pm on a sunday reservations recommended saw a long line for tables on the way in food was great a nice change from the typical cafe fare my only gripe was the cold service we tried cauliflower sabbich  i personally enjoyed this though would have preferred the pita to have been toasted grilled and the cauliflower crunchier to provide better texture this had a slightly soggy feel to it the israeli salad provided some tang which i liked and the smoked egg had a glorious flowy yolk would have preferred the egg warm rather than cold though overall a tasty dish haloumi mushrooms  the best dish of the  in my opinion the toast was thick and fluffy with generous portions of haloumi and mushrooms the best part was the smashed avocado spread on the toast it was salted nicely and went beautifully when you get a piece of toast with avocado haloumi and mushroom all in one bite artichoke fried chicken   pieces of chicken on a bed of crumbled hashed browns which went nicely with the garlic whip slightly too greasy for me and the chicken had a hint of honey did not enjoy the coleslaw but the chicken was flavorful we did not finish this good quality and novel food would return to try their intriguing dinner menu\",\"had fantastic late dinner snacks here last night best babaganoush i have ever had in my life cozy casual setting and nice staff\",\"easily one of the best middle eastern mediterranean restaurants on the red dot i would describe the decor as rustic chic if that makes any sense complemented by a full array of old school pop songs to set the vibe in layman is terms a cool place to eat and hangout in a communal setting the food itself is just tremendous my wife and i started off with the pita and hummus it was spot on next up was the slow roasted lamb shoulder wow simply wow the meat just fell off the bone after the first cut which is a testament to how tender it was mixed in with some amazing spices and herbs this dish easily was the star of the meal the other main dish we ordered was the charcoal grilled pork belly dish it was very good but surprisingly sweet i probably would not order both the lamb shoulder and the pork belly dish together as the flavours seemed to clash nevertheless these dishes on their own are just fantastic we topped the dinner off with artichoke is neh neh pops i went for the mango sticky pudding rice given my penchant for anything mango after the first bite it was no surprise to me that this was the best seller common how can you beat coconut rice mixed with blocks of frozen mango great food great vibe great company will definitely be back to try the other dishes but of course order that lamb shoulder again\",\"loved this place we were able to make a reservation right before leaving the house we walked and found this restaurant tucked away with cobblestone like area leading up to it is entrance you are immediately greeted by the dessert case and then are seated in either patio or inside space the ambiance is overall chic hip the lighting in the evening is soft and romantic the food is phenomenal and the service is very good as well this is one of my favorite tapas joints in singapore we started with the red sangria pitcher and then ordered the roasted cauliflower which had pomegranate it was so tasty and different we also got the whole market fish  roasted pumpkin and humus they brought out pita but we were good paleo kids and did not touch it we saved our cheat for the dark chocolate and almond baklava delicious we will definitely be back\",\"one of very few places i will truly miss when i leave singapore i have only been to artichoke for brunch so review does not cover dinner walk ins can be quite a wait but i have been lucky twice so far and was seated right away the cauliflower sabbich is to die for it is really perfect for singapore is hot weather as it has rich flavors and yet refreshing and if you are like me always on the lookout for fried roasted cauliflower it is absolutely amazing the artichoke fried chicken is spot on delicious crispy and juicy and the lamb shakshouka is super tender if you are a fan great coffee too planning to go back to try everything on their brunch menu\",\"what can i fault with this place absolutely nothing great food great ambience and great service the only thing i can pick on would be their coffee as it tasted a little sour perhaps not the kind of coffee bean we like i wish we could have done the lambgasm but will probably end up full with just one dish\",\"decent brunch but on the pricey side i have heard great things about the maple bacon chop but it was not as mindblowing as i thought it would be it was decent if a little greasy but not amazing lamb and fried chicken are decent unfortunately they do not split cards which means there are better places to go to for brunch with friends\",\"we showed up at   and were turned away by unfriendly staff if the kitchen is going to close at   you should change the hours\",\"reminds me of home my partner told me about the shop service was informed tasty dishes good on the wallet\",\"excellent ambience just what i was in the mood for this evening open air small and well thought out menu and most definitely not in a mall the food was excellent the highlights of the evening being the pumpkin mezze and the babycorn mezze the feta buratta was light and perfectly fluffy the lamb was well cooked but a tad bit bitter imho but complimented by the burrata skipped dessert but will defiently return p s there were mice running around understandable in a tropical outdoor setting but nevertheless unnerving\",\"we made reservations for brunch and were seated quickly though the place had several empty tables at the time our food came out quickly and everything was delicious lots of happy food noises were made i got the bacon and crab toast my spouse got the cauliflower sabbich the down side was service it was difficult to catch our waiter is eye he failed to bring out coffee in a timely manner so we cancelled it because we were almost done with our meal when we are back in singapore we will visit again\",\"everyone around me knows my stinginess for giving  stars but not only do i give this jewel a  star but also would go as far as saying if i were to recommend just one restaurant to have a unique tantalizing food experience in singapore other than the local options like chicken rice chili crab that everyone must check off their list it would have be artichoke but with that being said i have heard the same thing being said about burnt ends which i will definitely try soon enough artichoke offers creative dishes while staying true to the root of its cuisine yes regardless of how delicious their food is some restaurants just puzzle me with what cuisine they are serving to me how delicately they pull this off amazing here goes the breakdown hummus    no frill good hummus not the watered down version that makes you question how much of chickpeas is in it a bit of a bummer that it does not come with any pita bread i know i can just eat spoonful s of hummus by itself but come one not even one pita bread    served hot pita bread served here is on the thicker side not too chewy but i can tell it is good quality actually understand why this is a separate item to be ordered rather than served on the side although i complained above on not coming with my hummus order this is a must order as many of the dishes at artichoke has sauces that deserves to be wiped to the bottom with this pita bread fresh fig goat cheese   i admit that even from just reading this menu i knew that i was to fall in love fig goat cheese simply cannot go wrong but then again how artichoke artfully put together fresh fig on a spread of creamy goat cheese was just orgasmic feta burrata   really fresh unique twist to the regular burrata dishes i would say this is the prime example of what i meant by creative while staying true to the root some may argue that burrata is italian but adding the feta kick to it absolutely justified its presence on the mediterranean menu innovative just plain delicious hot skillet prawn   jesus my friend and i almost licked the skillet  huge prawns that was better than lobster sauce was not to be wasted i remember this dish being rather salty last time but this time they were perfect have this just have it slow roasted lamb shoulder   so succulent full of flavor another dish that requires pita bread to wash the plate lamb was so well roasted the texture of the meat was soft while not mushy the smell of the lamb was very well controlled i know for some people the strong smell particular to lamb meat is of problem babaganoush    do not get me wrong just because i raved about other dishes so much does not mean that babaganoush was bad it was just different from my expectation of creamy dark colored paste artichoke is babaganoush made it very obvious that it was made of eggplant the texture and taste is maintained unlike other babaganoush i have tried it was good but i prefer my creamy dark colored version neh neh pops it shows that you do not have to go crazy complicated to come up with a strongly branded item neh neh pop is simple yet alluring presentation along with its hand packed looking packaging crafts a sense of craft no pun intended which draws people making them ignore the little voice in their head saying it is just magnum with bunch of stuffs put all over they seem to be actively experimenting with the flavors such as neh espresso cheesecake etc looking forward to all the fun flavors baklava flavor   i am a huge fan of balkava how its crispness is preserved while keeping all the mouth watering sweetness in between its layers but really not impressed by this flavor on nehneh pops ice cream was not rich either actually tasted a bit of icy ness which is what i taste when ice cream melts then re freezes i would not go for it a bit too sweet as baklava is sugary sweetness and ice cream chocolate is deeper sweetness strikes your tastebuds separately creating a not so pleasant overdose of sweetness strawberry pokey   contrary to my initial standing that it would be rather boring its back to basic approach was done very well i do not think the cover was white chocolate which really works for me i look for a lot of things when visiting a restaurant but here food speaks for the brand the ambiance entirety of experience is not bad but not impression leaving food is just so well done it is not only delicious un pretentious but also fun this is combination of using good ingredients adding succulent flavors playing with mix of tastes while not losing touch in presentation\",\"expensive but worth every single dollar spent there is an instant vibe as soon as you walk in the atmosphere was upbeat modern and i almost felt back home in california each bite from every dish i tried made my eyes roll back in my head as i uttered an unconscious mmmmmmmm if you are going to eat here forget about the price and enjoy the food if you are on a tight budget go somewhere else\",\"every time i am in singapore i make sure to come to artichoke i have been maybe  or  times over the past few years after having eaten all over the world artichoke stands out as being unique and almost extreme and yet is always masterfully balanced and oddly familiar you could eat here everyday it is consistently some of the best food i have ever eaten no it is not a gourmet michelin star restaurant but it is not meant to be just like the evolution of singaporean dishes that have been influenced by malay chinese and indian food bjorn shen does his voodoo using middle eastern cuisine as the foundation instead what he calls funky middle eastern omg it is magic the eclectic mix of hip hop reggae and rap music ensure the atmosphere is not stuffy and the staff who have been constant over the years are friendly and definitely know there stuff i rarely write reviews because i am too lazy or apathetic about my experience so do not take my review lightly and know that i am super serious when i say i wish more chefs were as wildly creative and open minded it would lead to some seriously awesome food and i need more of that in my life what i have tried muhammara more please cauliflower sabbich awesome flavors artichoke fried chicken chicken was super tender always amazed by restaurants that can cook chicken just enough so it does not taste undercooked but not dry it out especially with the thicker cuts yum lamb shakshouka what could be better for breakfast than lamb salmon pancake one of my favorites sadly not on the menu anymore hot skillet prawns i could eat it every day no really i want some right now maple glazed bacon chop be warned its big meaty and delicious\",\"poorly managed place we came at pm for a quick brunch and they had plenty of empty tables   but refused to give one because they were reserved for pm we told them we would be gone by pm as we wanted a quick breakfast but apparently they cannot make breakfast in an hour it is better to keep the tables empty\",\"th time here busy busydim sum was on point no surprise there right hot and sour soup was the bomb\",\"always nice to eat at one of my favorite restaurants that serve soup dumpling if you are craving good chinese food come here\",\"i cannot recommend the truffle dumpling enough they are delicious and amazingly decadent i wish there were smaller portions for some items so singles can get some variety but everything i tasted was wonderful\",\"outstanding food and even better service if you want one of the best meals in singapore go here you will not regret it side note extremely friendly and helpful with small children our daughter had a blast here\",\"overrated if you order  or  orders of dumplings then you might be able to distinguish the taste but we ordered more than  orders all different ones so i felt that it all tasted the same after my nd dumpling the oriental salad was delicious and my favorite the fried rice was incredibly tasty too the duck wrap i ordered was good but i would not order it again i was not a fan of their bbq pork buns all dough and barely any meat filling service was subpar we were ignored for a short while i would pick the dim sum at the hawker centers instead\",\"i finally got to try the din tai fung is famous steamed pork dumplings there is a location in the raffles city shopping center the verdict pretty tasty how do they make these how do they get the soup to stay inside the meat and the dumpling itself was delicious but i would not say it was mind blowing maybe i had high expectations because it was so hyped up i also tried the steamed chicken soup because the menu said it was another thing they were famous for i did not like this as much i thought the broth was kind of bland and most of the chicken was white meat so slightly dry they give you a pen and you have to mark down how many of each item you want for the dumplings you have the option of getting six pieces or ten pieces and it comes out in one of those bamboo steamer baskets overall tasty dumplings but nothing to go out of your way for\",\"i have been here twice now i waited to write a review because i wanted to make sure my first trip was not an anomalyi do not understand why everyone is so crazy about this place one just opened near san francisco and the wait time can be three hours i figured i would try it in se asia the second time there i waited for a single table almost one hour the service is lousy a runner just dumps the dish on the table and leaves without checking if it is correct or you need anything else but the worst part was the xiao long bao both times was dried out like it had been sitting on a warming shelf for a while this is supposed to be the reason people come here my order was wrong one of the times but i was too annoyed at waiting an hour so i did not complain the sides were okay i will never come back\",\"if you ever find yourself in singapore do your self a favor avoid the super snooty overpriced restaurants find this little gem which truthfully is not so little at all and come hungry they have an incredibly wide assortment of dim sum as week as their speciality soup dumplings nom nomyou will certainly not be disappointed though this location wo not win any rewards in ambience and decor it is clean decorum coupled with an efficiency in both acquiring a table and being served or food with  minutes of being seated is an award all to itself whilst waiting to be seated you are given both a menu on a clipboard and a picture book of all the succulent options some options come in multiples of    or  so make sure to carefully discern quantity when making your selections you are also assigned a queue number which is conveniently illuminated at the entrance just above your head thus no mystery as to when you will be seated once your number your number is called the hostess takes your menu reviews your order with you before seating at your table which is being cleaned quickly during that time once you are seated you receive the first of your items usually within  minutes efficiency ladies and gents is the name of the game when going to most places in singapore\",\"came to dtf with friends for brunch this was my first time here and the friends said they offered more on the singapore menu than the one back at home we tried the pork and veggie dumplings yum shrimp and pork shumai yum fried pork and shrimp wontons yum pork rib soup yum soup dumplings yum stir fried bok choy yum shrimp and pork wontons in soup yum crab and pork dumplings good very crabby aaaaand crispy shrimp pancake bomb overall my first experience at dtf was so worth it\",\"this was our first stop for food on the first morning of our most recent visit to singapore dumplings i love the consistency every restaurant churns out the same great food and hopefully decent service this place gives you a basket for your purse and a napkin to cover it that way no dumpling juice or soy splashes it we shared the pork and tofu noodles pork xlb shrimp and pork xlb duck skin cigars and red bean sticky rice all solid choices and i enjoyed everything we ate\",\"wow i am not a chinese food expert but this was good stuff chicken soup was indescribably delicious and made my tummy feel good the steamed pork dumplings were amazing\",\"the food is always consistent at any din tai fung i have been too i loooove the oriental salad and all the yummy dimsum\",\"i would say this place is overrated stopped by for dinner last night and ordered the soup dumpling with a vermicelli soup the vermicelli soup with fried tofu was pretty good the broth was really flavorful but the soup dumpling is lacking in flavor big time true the skin is thin has the right consistency and there juice inside however the flavor of the filling is also a big part of the soup dumpling and i found the meat filling was rather bland\",\"i realise i have falled into a predictable pattern of late whenever i want dim sum i go to dtf few restaurants have inspired such loyalty from me and that is simply owing to their reliable dim sum with consistent quality not to say there are not any cons the waiting time can range from   minutes on the weekends although they are kind enough to let you pick your food while you wait and make your order just as you are whisked to a table the menu is a bit limited in my opinion no char siew pau or chee cheong fun two staples on the dim sum menu it is also not particularly adventurous if you are into that sort of thing having said that whatever they do serve is very good promptly dished the pork and chilli crab steamed bun is delicious as is their soup dumplings i am also a sucker for their mango pudding which i never have space for because i have just gorged on  prawn and pork dumplings if you want some otherworldly dim sum you wo not get it here if you just want a straightforward good dumpling this place will not fail you\",\"decent quality and consistent food i like the egg fried rice sometimes i get it with shrimp and the wonton soup good stuff can count on it being the same every time i go of course the xiao long baos are decent too\",\"really good huge menu i tasted many of them good prices even for singapore free refill tea is great what can i say i loved it\",\"yes i am a fan of this place i was a bit worried that it wo not be as good as the original place in taiwan but they are quite good when i worked near city hall i used to come here once a week and yes that is how satisfying it was try their red bean dessert dumplings\",\"on a personal note this is the last restaurant review i will write from my recent time living in singapore i truly loved the island and took immense joy in exploring its varied culinary landscape it is special place populated by such amazing people locals and expats from the depth of my heart i hope i am able to return someday this is a review of dinner with two friends at din tai fung in raffles city shopping centre tinyurl com lvncbthis din tai fung is located in the basement level of raffles city it is pretty far into the level and can be a little difficult to locate also unless you arrive early for dinner you should expect a wait i think we arrived around   or so we had a  to  minute wait for our table but i think those arriving when we were being seated were probably having a little longer wait the ambiance is a notch above basic but still trends towards the functional i would not place it at the level of fine dining it lacks the attention to detail that a fine dining room displays tinyurl com kldxxdthe staff is very effective i would not necessarily use the word friendly though they are certainly not rude everyone just seems too busy and focused on their tasks to take a moment for overt politeness also the experience seems to be based on speed get folks seated get their order get them their food asap and get them on their way rinse and repeat the food ranged from good to extremely good tinyurl com lfurlwmcrispy prawn pancake this was my least favourite dish there was not anything particularly wrong with it but it lacked layers of flavours that would have brought it up a notch tinyurl com mdrrdpchicken with wine sauce this was such a enjoyable chicken dish it is another example of a dish that allowed the basic ingredient to shine through the wine sauce complimented the chicken without overwhelming it plus the chicken was very tender tinyurl com lyzsbgprawn fried rice i love rice but i tend to prefer steamed rices however if i keep running into fried rices as good as this i may become a convert it was light the prawns were sweet the eggs provided a rich earthy note at some level it was difficult to believe this was a fried dish tinyurl com kcpztlbcold pork i enjoyed the flavours of this dish the lightness of the pork the freshness of the onions the nice touch of the sesame seeds all that being said i would prefer this dish with the pork served hot tinyurl com mchnjprawn dumplings i love prawn dumplings these were very good fresh hot sweet etc tinyurl com lpqrnxia long bao soup dumplings this is the dish that brings a lot of folks to din tai fung they did not disappoint dipped into the vinegar and ginger and then popped into your mouth for a flavour explosion just make sure not to burn yourself tinyurl com mefulri do not know the cost my friends were kind enough to treat me to dinner overall din tai fung is about the food and they delivered for the overall experience i would say this was more   star than  the food definitely warranted  stars the service could be a little more personable and little less rushed but i guess if they did not hurry we would all have to wait a little longer to get our delicious xia long bao\",\"came here during my  week visit to singapore about  times loved their seaweed vegetable salad app the pork dumplings spicy cucumber and the shrimp fried rice there was typically a wait if you came at normal eating hours and even off peak there were always plenty of tables filled up i do like the numbering system and how they call out the tables easier to hear than names being called and lets you not stand in a line like other places in the mall service was typically quick although items came out as they were ready and not necessarily in the order that you would expect them this did not bother me as i was eating alone but might be weird if you are in a group and ordering separately although this is a chain i felt that this location was a nice option for dinner for almost any occasion from date night to casual eating alone i think you have to visit one location of this restaurant if you are visiting singapore\",\"before traveling to singapore for work i checked out some yelp reviews to see what the restaurants close to my hotel offered i am glad i read reviews of din tai fung because i made the effort to find it and ended up going three times during a two week trip my hotel the swissotel was connected to the raffles city mall so that made it very convenient but i still would have made the effort to go back there was usually a line but it cleared quickly and the hostesses provided order sheets and menus so you could decide on your meal before you sat down one of my favorite parts of the experience was the crib they provide for ladies bags and that once you put your bag inside they cover it with a napkin as if the bags are being tucked in for a nap but my most favorite thing were the dumplings these soup dumplings might be the most delightful thing i have ever eaten the sensation of putting one in your mouth and the warm soup bursting out yeah yeah phrasing boom just brings a smile to your face the texture of the dumplings is firm but soft and the soup has great flavor i tried several varieties with the traditional pork being my favorite the shrimp and the chicken were also good but i did not care for the crab very much i also tried the shrimp fried rice and an eggplant side dish and both were great i have seriously been telling everyone about these dumplings since i went on this trip if you are in singapore din tai fung is a must\",\"jumbo cooked crab and seafood had a great time with our group visiting from around the world service and food was excellent and i would recommend the peppered crab location has an outdoor patio and views of the ocean set in a semicircle park\",\"i was surprised to find out that this restaurant chain is a public company listed in singapore stock market they must have perfected the process and quality of food across their restaurants the evening rush with full occupancy on all  floors and outside seating area showed that the customers appreciated it the famous pepper and chili crabs lived up to their hypes all other foods were fantastic every dish that we ordered was good this is a must visit while in singapore the only complaint i had was lack of service after all the dishes were served we basically were ignored the final check came to about us  for  people not cheap in singapore standard but worth it\",\"singapore is known for very good global fusion plates it is one of a few countries where everything works infrastructure wise and everyone gets along i e  cultures coexist indian chinese malay indonesian decently one of the famed dishes in this beautiful country is singaporean chilli that is right two ls crab there are tomes which document the popularity of chilli crab so i was curious to sample this dish jumbo seafood is one of the best preparers of chilli crab we did not have time to search out kek seafood another source for good chilli crab so jumbo had to do for this trip location wise there is a jumbo seafood in many parts of the city so it is accessible i also saw a jumbo in icon siam bangkok so jumbo is expanding too we ordered a crab about  us for  and while the crab was presented nicely and smelled awesome i failed to appreciate this famous dish for the following reasons first crabs are imported from malaysia or indonesia i cannot remember which country and it is reflected in the price the chilli crab comes with a cloyingly sweet sauce with a hint of heat spice i am definitely not into sweet main courses it also came with deliciously light and pillowy sweet again buns a k a man tou to sop up the sauce it gave my palate a  sweet with a whisper of heat honestly i was a bit disoriented sweet is dessert for me not a main course maybe it was an off night and more sugar was added than less maybe i am spoiled with phenom indo vietnamese malaysian chinese cambodian lao korean thai chefs educating my palate in los angeles maybe willing to cut some slack here but if this dish should be soulfully sweet then that was the last time i will have had the famous chilli crab i cannot claim the crabmeat tasted sweet because it did not the creature traveled from another country had it been caught in the nearest river or sea it would have been sweet the other dishes we ordered were very good however prawns with golden salted egg mee goreng malay style kang kong fried rice service was very good tip jumbo seafood is also a tourist destination prices are high even for singapore i would come to this location if you were to visit as it is on the water if you like h check out the yelpista pix\",\"sticking with singapore classics you definitely need to visit jumbo seafood for amazing chilli crab jumbo serves delicious flavourful singapore seafood and other meat dishes the chilli crab is a definite must try although it may be a bit spicy the flavours are extremely delicious and very unique for those who are allergic to peanuts though the black pepper crab is just as flavourful and is an awesome replacement the crab is so succulent tender and soaks up all the sauce another must try is the mocha ribs and the drunken prawns the mocha ribs have a slightly sweet hint but it works well with the moist tender pork meat the drunken prawns are just as mouthwatering you may think that there will be a lot of alcohol flavour but surprisingly there is only a slight alcohol taste and more chicken essence than anything the prawns are also juicy and cooked to perfection they are infused with the delicious chicken and alcohol flavour other than the food the restaurant has an outstanding view of the ocean and has excellent service they are also very accommodating with food allergies and have managers ready to explain all the dishes or provide you with suggested dishes that can fit your specific diet if you visit singapore jumbo is a must try\",\"there are so many different places that that serve chili crab and so many different ways people try to infuse chili crab into dishes after a fair amount of internet research i decided to go with jumbo which would provide a nicer restaurant experience and would have great chili crab we were not disappointed i made a reservation through chope which is highly advisable particularly on a weekend night i did not see many people queuing but all of the tables were full we had an early reservation and were able to secure an outdoor table where we could enjoy the sunset and view but beware of mosquitos we ordered a chili crab a medium sized one which was plenty for the three of us a side of vegetables steamed rice and chow mein the chili crab was delicious and has the right balance of heat and sweetness definitely order steamed rice to drench your rice in the crab and sauce the chow mein was underwhelming\",\"wow we heard about this place from a electric sales person here in singapore he was absolutely right best sweet chili crab ever service was great food was fantastic if i lived here i am sure i would be her at least once or twice a week guarantee jeff hom\",\"a singapore institution for seafood definitely get the chili crab it is a giant crab served in a sweet spicy sauce also get the man tou pan fried bread to dip in the crab sweet spicy sauce quality of the crab is excellent sweet fresh crab that goes well with the sauce the black pepper crab is not as good though so perhaps stick to the chili crab for jumbo the seafood is fresh in general we also enjoyed the ginger and scallion prawn and steamed fish\",\"thank you julia tran for a great meal it was truly special julia took careful care of you of our kids that had allergy issues she made his dishes first before all the others once she took the initiative order she checked with the chef on the ingredients and to warn him to wash the woks before preparing these special dishes i noticed she was wearing a hair net after talking with the chef this made me think there is a high standard level of cleanliness in the kitchen all the dishes we ordered were equally great plus she order exactly the correct amount so nothing was left for  people we have no idea how much we ordered of each item so we are now anticipating the bill what did we get chili and pepper crab i preferred the black pepper both both were good i liked the vegetable dishes the produce is very fresh one was chinese broccoli and scallops and the other dragon greens mushrooms and garlic cereal shrimp okay but others liked it beef and onion fried cod cubed and shrimp friend rice lastly the mini buns were light and the outside crust lightly crunchy with about  sodas and  service the total price was  for  or about  a person the service was fantastic it was definitely worth it\",\"make no mistake this is a tourist trap back in the days before jumbo seafood ipo on the stock exchange prices were more affordable reasonable right now expect exorbitant prices of the seafood dishes i went there with the family  of us and ordered steam prawns chili crap salted egg crap sambal kang kong fried baby squid chinese donut fried mee goreng hot plate tofu desserts with a jug of beer total bill came to  unfortunately this will be my last visit to jumbo seafood\",\"came here on a monday night due to a recommendation from a local friend and this place was packed we did not have a reservation but luckily were seated within  minutes we ordered both the famous chili crabs as well as the black pepper crabs they will provide you with bibs which were an absolute must because the sauce can easily get everywhere the sauce from the chili crab was perfectly seasoned rich and thick yet not too spicy tons of flavor imbued in every bite i simply could not stop eating it then the black pepper crabs arrived and i started devouring those too although i did find the kick of the pepper to be actually a tad bit stronger than the chili version if you make it out here you wo not go wrong with either dish but just to be safe you should definitely order both\",\"as many have already said you must try chili crab in singapore and every time i am here this is the place i go it is a large crab some of the pieces require a bit of patience to get the meat out but wow is it delicious get the fried rolls to dip into the sauce in fact grab a spoon and just shove that delicious sauce into your mouth it is that good i also tried the sambal shrimp which was delicious as well with plump shrimp and little pieces of pineapple in it hotel called in a reservation and i was seated immediately warning it is messy\",\"went back again this year and it was excellent again looking forward to the next visit\",\"i believe this is the only one that takes reservations arrived on schedule n sat down promptly ordered the recommemd chili crab and bamboo muscle cereal shrimp the chili crab delicious as everyone described cereal shrimp was too sweet for my taste overall a bit pricy but worth the try\",\"chili crab it is first time in singapore and the hype is real about chili crab went with a few colleagues and wanted to know what the fuss was the restaurant itself was full of people locals tourist people celebrating etc definitely a crowd almost every dish we had was superb and full of flavor ambiance was great and decent service it is pricey however could honestly just eat the bread dipped into the chili crab sauce all day the chili crab itself was very delicious and you can kind of understand why it is a must try also got the prawns with cereal i was kind of unsure about this dish but i am glad i ate it very different but unique and taste great the golden phoenix chicken one of my favorites\",\"signature chili crab was a wondrous experience great service too and fast so many side items also hit the mark superb bamboo clams tender and succulent they were overshadowed by the crab which was mega fresh and meaty save the crab for last pro tip if you leave this place hungry you are doing it wrong\",\"we came with a table of   for a big family dinner and the service was extremely slow we came on a sunday night for dinner dishes came out one by one and the table would be empty for a good   minute between dishes this is not typically for a family style asian restaurant the staff and kitchen usually time the dishes better so there is a continuous flow of food most of the food was cold when arrived but very flavorful the main dish was the black pepper crab and it was quite delicious very nice pepper taste that left your mouth tingling a bit with spice would have tasted better if the dish was warmer overall food is not bad the reason for the  is due to the slow service and cold food i hope this restaurant can staff up and be more efficient with the dining experience\",\"great location on waterfront make a reservation as it is a destination for many tourists and locals celebrating events you have to try the chili crab and or black pepper crab huge tasty and enough for   folks if you speak mandarin it helps we had one person in group who did and made ordering and service better\",\"on our last night in singapore my boyfriend is mother and sister took us to jumbo seafood where we had a beautiful waterfront view although i love crab my boyfriend is not a fan but we still decided to go because our new friends in hong kong raved about trying pepper and or chili crab we ordered chili crab fried cod fish with spicy sauce scallops wrapped in yam ring broccoli with scallops steamed white buns and deep fried bunsthe chili crab was wonderful the crab we received a portion size for three people was the largest crab i have ever seen certainly fitting considering the name of the restaurant i am not usually a fan of filling up on bread but it was difficult to resist dipping the steamed buns in the chili crab sauce and this is was after i ate spoonfuls on top of my rice so much flavor the broccoli with scallops were fine but the scallops wrapped in yam were even better my boyfriend almost decided to get a second order of them finally the fried cod fish was delicious i would order that again as well our bill ended up around sgd   if you are not opposed to taking a day trip to malaysia possible via bus car or taxi we were told you can get much more pepper or chili crab for much cheaper there regardless i highly recommend you check this place out if you are in singapore extra tips and fyis there is no ac make reservations if you want to avoid a long wait during certain days or times the menu has plenty of pictures and english to help guide your ordering chili crab can be quite messy i recommend using the disposable bibs they give out do not be afraid to flag down any server you see if you need something if you have trouble breaking through the huge claws or other parts of the crab you can put them on a plate and ask the server to have the kitchen break them for you you do not want any going to waste\",\"came here my last day in singapore since i felt like chili crab is an obligated must eat this place has a huge outdoor seating with quite minimum wait service was great as our server even helped us to crack the crab more onto the food we got the more expensive alaskan deep sea crab cuz there was a promotion the dish came like warm this was not my first time eating chili crab in jumbo or no signboard and luke warm crab was not satisfying the chili sauce was amazing as it seems like they put broken crab meat in it overall i think jumbo or no signboard have both going downhill in terms of quality maybe next time chili crab should no longer be my must eat\",\"when in singapore you must try chilli crab or atleast that is what any guide book seems to insist suppressing all scepticism i took a visiting friend to jumbo which is one of the four chilli crab meccas here all lined conveniently next to each other along east coast park we got one chilli crab to share between two of us which cost around  no chilli crab is complete without deep fried buns to mop up the gravy and jumbo is are just sheer perfection crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside with just a slight sweetness to them at this point i need to throw up my hands and admit that yes jumbo is serves some pretty damn good chilli crab the gravy is delicious rich and thick the best part is the sharp kick to it at the end i was expecting it to be a lot spicier than it was but it had too much flavour packed into it to make up for it the crab itself was juicy and tender we struggled to get all the flesh out of the shell but it is worth prying out every little bit the atmosphere is also incredibly relaxing especially if you snag an outside table right next to the ocean the staff were all very prompt and efficient we were the last ones to leave the restaurant but they made no motion to hurry us and even gave us a  discount at the end for no reason my only gripe is the very small vegetarian selection which is somewhat understandable at a seafood restaurant my mother got rice with vegetable stir fry which came in a tiny portion costing  total rip off for a very average tasting dish\",\"this is the prefect place for some late night dumplings it is almost am in singapore and i was so hungry i guess hanging out with friends will do that it does not hurt to soak up and beer either this place is quick not the best dumplings i have had but the service is good and there are pretty tasty i love pork so i always get that with a side of veggies depending on the time of morning since that is when i come it cane be a bit busy with people eating but tonight morning was not too bad\",\"stopped by here when i visited little india flavors are quite good and filling without it being overwhelmingly heavy also cash only they close for a few hours to prep for dinner i really wanted to try a few dishes on their dinner menu but never got a chance to go back i can imagine this being a good place for a late night grub worth visiting and giving a try if you are in the area\",\"i saw great reviews about this dim sum restaurant so i decided to give them a try however it was over rated we got there early so we did not have to queue in line it was great we were seated right after they opened at  i was impressed that this place was pretty tech savvy for a dim sum restaurant we scanned a qr code to order on the smartphone typically i am used to picking my dim sum from a cart or ordering on a piece of paper i am giving them three stars because none of our dishes came out hot all of the food that came out was either warm or cold again the dishes should have been hot i was pretty disappointed\",\"very popular dim sum place they have three stores next to each other which they open based on demand we arrived right after  am when they were opening and had no trouble finding a spot to sit we ordered an array of dim sum plates which were good and pretty standard but tasty and some jasmine tea to go along with it my favorites were the dumplings and the buns although i have no idea what they were filled with we just ordered based on the pictures on the menu which was really helpful the spicy items are really spice so be careful when ordering no frills cheap fast food\",\"i had a mouthgasm from eating here everything was so good tips bring cash cause they do not accept credit cards also they are closed on tuesday\",\"one of my favorite late night eats when i am in singapore expect a long wait although they have expanded to encompass three different rooms now one of my favorites is their unique mee sua kueh which is a pan fried mee sua noodle that looks like carrot turnip cake i like to drizzle the spicy wanton sauce on it before eating yum service is not the best but then again you come for the good food and not  star service treatment\",\"beancurd roll   starsbit too salty pretty sure there is prawn or meat inside fried pumpkin with custard  starsit is  inside not sure how i feel about it but the texture was great passion fruit juice    stars\",\"this is my favorite supper haunt every time i come here i end up ordering about half of the stuff on the menu i know there are better quality dim sum out there but none can beat the variety do not be intimidated by the line yes there is always a discouraging queue of people waiting on the roadside but it is also moves fast since they have sooo many tables a few of my favorites are liu sha bao salted egg yolk bao steamed pork ribs chee chong fun with prawn charsiew mee suah kueh beancurd chicken roll shredded dried beancurd parsleyyou can ask for chili oil and they will give it to you generously\",\"the dim sum i had from here during my summer in sg has made me unable to enjoy any other dim sum since my friends and i came every chance we could and it especially hit the spot after clubbing since it is known for being open till am over a year later we still reminisce about the salted egg yolk custard buns which are h e a v e n i also highly recommend the rice rolls w char siew pig trotters and of course the xiao long bao but everything else tasted good too except i would skip the egg tarts and go to tai cheong for those swee choon is will forever have a piece of my heart try at your own risk you may never be able to eat average dim sum again\",\"honestly we were so excited to get some dim sum at singapore and the place seemed to have pretty good reviews but it really was not anything special we ordered a whole bunch of stuff and nothing really stood out for going to a lot of dim sum places this place was subpar at best they also do this thing in a lot of singapore restaurants where they charge you for hand towels and tap water they put the towel on our table for use but then we realized after that you get charged and they do not really specify that\",\"if you want classic dim sum dishes or chinese main dishes swee choon is a must try extremely well known for the dim sum swee choon has all your favourite dim sum dishes but have elevated the food to be more refined and more delicious a definite must try is their salty egg yolk bun the bun is so light and fluffy while the egg yolk is so creamy and oozes out of the bun the egg yolk also is so flavourful and compliments the soft bun so well another must try is the fried taro dumplings filled with delicious meat these taro dumplings are fried to perfection and are much larger than what you normally find in other restaurants they also serve fried turnip cake and fried red bean crepes if you want a dish with more substance or bigger portions they also have rice and noodles dishes highly recommend their ho fun which is a rice noodle dish with an egg sauce the ho fun is so flavourful and also comes with veggies and seafood this place is a must try for both dim sum and normal chinese dishes\",\"great food and superior prices do not worry about the long line out front they move quickly you use your phone for ordering so the food comes quickly but maybe a little out of sequence we had the crispy fried pork sauted long beans with minced pork and the sichuan chili oil wonton i have to say all the items were the best i have ever had finished the meal off with chilled cocoanut pudding for a great finish\",\"i am a big fan of dim sum i have tried a lot in different country the line is really fast there are a lot of place inside with ac about the food siu mai is ok ha kao has two big shrimps inside they come by  pieces xiao long bao skin soft but the soup was not there just a little bit prawn chee cheong fun only for dinner for the rest fried dim sum and desert were just ok so i wo not come back for sure there are many better dim sum restaurant in singapore go there only if all the others dim sum are close they open all night\",\"this was the last stop of our  part brunch and by the time we arrived we were pretty much eating for sport we ordered a few savory and a few sweet dim sum dishes and tried our best to eat everything the portuguese egg tart was satisfying as was the salted egg yolk custard bun although the sweet items were good the savory ones were just ok i am kind of surprised by the number of great reviews for this place compared to dim sum in hong kong or even in the us this was not that impressive save your precious stomach space for something more special\",\"pretty solid dim sum place with a variety of dishes my favorites were the pork ribs the big bao and the mango dessert they have a ton of options so you can satisfy any picky person\",\"the dimsum of swee choon can easily stand next to the more upscale versions in town and now they are open for lunch too plus they still serve the late night crowds their custard buns are hands down the best version i had throughout singapore and one of the reasons to come back other things i like include xiao long bao egg tarts har kau the no nonsense efficient style of the restaurant makes me forgiving for the lack of contact between the servers and the customers and unlike at other chinese restaurants in town i have never been given even as much as an eye twitch that i do not speak chinese love it\",\"portuguese egg tart not too sweet flaky layers of crust one of the best bao with creamy inside very nice while hot xiao long bao soup is nice juicy meat on the inside sticky rice with chicken carrot cake crispy edges late night eats just say yes\",\"my go to spot for dim sum in singapore you can find most of your typical dim sum dishes siew mai har gao rice rolls bbq pork buns etc plus more such as soup dumplings you have to also try the green onion pancake as well as the chili wontons a filling meal for two ran us about  sgd which is a steal only reason why i gave swee choon  stars is because the auntie at the the counter was annoyed when i told her i did not eat the appetizers they put on the table which we knew they were going to charge us for if you are not going to eat the appetizers be sure to tell the waitress to take it away or else they will charge you for it aside from this i think swee choon is great for the money if you are looking for dim sum in singapore\",\"pros overnight hourscheapfastcons food is not deliciousthis location is a place frequented by after party drunkards may get noisy food is very cheap but only mediocre\",\"great food great service good for expatsthe picture menu helped you need cash or a card that is used in singapore to pay luckily there is a atm across the street we had fun and will go back when in town again\",\"great food and excellent decor definitely should check it out there is not a lot else to write but i have to fill space so here is some words please dont moderate me yelp\",\"came here for the lunch tasting menu since it was a bit cheaper than dinner coming in here they start you off with some bread and nicely whipped butter need less to say that it was amazing the tasting menu consisted of amuse bouche carabinero prawns new zealand blue cod crispy scales wagyu beef cheek japanese chestnut the amuse bouche that was served to us was a leech bubble bursting with a delicate cold sweetness and a shrimp cracker with some roe the former is a little bit sweeter but then the latter is more savory so definitely eat in that order we then had these prawns and wow that was amazing the spot prawns were cooked sashimi style and served in this amazing bed of fruits and vegetables it was such a light dish that had so much going on sweetness acidic multiple textures and i loved this dish i found myself finishing all the dressing as well since it was just so perfect and really maximized the freshness of the spot prawns it came with some squid ink rice crackers so really let you get a very delectable bite next come the entrees and imo the absolute star of the show the cod with fried skin they leave the scales on and deep fry that i have never had this in my life but omg if this was not the best cod i have had in my life step one the meat is obviously cooked to perfection not too tough as to be overcooked and not too soft where it is a bit raw just perfect but that is tablestakes the jewel was the skin the scales all popped up and was sprinkled with a generous amount of sea salt and a bite into the skin just felt like you were tasting this fish straight from the ocean with all it is saltiness it was amazing the texture was so crispy and it did not leak to the tender meat below the beef wagyu cheek was probably the best cheek i have had that being said though i am not sure if i love cheek that much the texture of cheek is traditionally chewy and here it was fattier and much more tender than i am used to it almost tasted like other parts of wagyu flank for example but i would have just preferred normal ribeye wagyu i appreciate the quality and skill here and i feel it is like showcasing a more forgotten piece of steak i would just rather have the wagyu ribeye though the dessert left a little to be desired there was some alchohol flavor in the sauce and the dish was good just nothing too special here all in all it was a great meal and came out to be s  after tip and taxes for two i think the price point is pretty spot on and i would come back it is not a bargain by any means but not a rip off either\",\"i tried the chef is choice  meal courses for s   it was very beautiful sophisticated presentation wagyu dishes was over flavored do not really taste wagyu itself flavor black truffle was on the one of the dishes when i bite it i expect to smell the great fragrance of truffle but did not so if you like to eat the dishes respect the natural flavor of the material then probably this restaurant is not the one this restaurant is michelin one star restaurant i would recommend the  meal or  meal courses cheaper and enjoy the pretty building and pretty dishes\",\"michelin restaurant tucked in the singapore botanical gardens such a wonderful surprise and delightful food experience nicely air conditioned but not cold the courses were timed perfectly and each so yummy we never expected to have such a beautiful and tasty meal while exploring a garden we enjoyed every course of the meal\",\"food is so amazing we were a small group and we were all enthusiastic about our dining experience the celebrity chef came out at the end i can only imagine how much effort and passion go into his dishes really a lot of work and attention to all details cannot recommend anything in particular as most was excellent wagu beef lobster desserts nice\",\"a huge splurge for a brilliant meal in the heart of singapore is botanical gardens impeccable service my love of this restaurant is skewed by the incredible amuse bouche and a single petit four the salted egg macaroons my god these might be one of the best things i have ever eaten they melt on your tongue leaving a cacophony of flavour if there is a peak for singapore is salted egg obsession this is it but truth be told the rest of the meal was a mix of the innovative and unexciting the asparagus was quite plain the gariguette strawberry quickly became an unrecognisable mix of fruit flavours the crispy cod though was perfection and use of frozen creme fraiche exciting the venue is beautiful and the service impeccable even if dinner plus three house wines between four cost a hefty  sgd it was an evening to remember\",\"we came to corner house for dinner on our second night in town the restaurant itself is within singapore botanical gardens but even though we came after the gardens had closed and the sun was setting there are clear signs from the taxi dropoff to direct you to corner house without much trouble once there you are escorted up the stairs into the main dining area there are different sections to it given the older colonial nature of the building but the finishes are modern and refined like much of the city state itself one of the standouts for sure alongside the decor is the general ambiance and the plateware in particular it has the feeling of a high end restaurant but comes off as more relaxing thanks to the temperature here no one shows up in the more formal dress i would expect to see at a european or american michelin starred restaurant but the design and thoughtfulness of the food presentation is evident drinks are limited to an extensive selection of wines i stuck with a glass of white and red for the meal itself both of which were quite good as for service i found it a bit more attentive than candlenut from the previous night but in a similar fashion it was not overly personalized either in a similar vein what was listed on our tasting menu was exactly what we got no deviation or extra surprises along the way while there are other menu options if you do not come over the weekend you only have the option of the tasting menu otherwise we were there sunday you get  courses but two of those are the amuse bouche and the petit fours so it is a bit more of a compressed tasting menu than i was expecting to have that said i felt that every dish was very strong as a result it certainly seemed that the chef and their staff were able to focus on making each dish as good as possible the amuse bouche to start off were mostly small bites and served in an interesting fashion our fish skin chips with trout roe were served atop a bed of small pebble my favorite of the amuse bouche round was the last dish presented which was an excellent raw shrimp dish served with cucumbers and a lime infused broth simple and refreshing we moved onto more seafood that was excellently prepared the scallop dish was served cool and with dry ice and combined with the yuzu was fresh and the geoduck clam that came next was served with a generous amount of sliced clam and pasta making it a bit of an italian inspired dish that focused mainly on showcasing the seafood flavors instead of being doused with sauce the white asparagus dish was a nice respite from the rest of the meal the only vegetarian course outside of dessert but a bit more restrained from a flavor perspective the highlight was definitely the blue cod which was served with the scales of the skin crisped mixing the succulence of the fish fillet with the saltiness and crunchy texture of the skin definitely one of the most beautiful looking fish dishes i have eaten and gorgeously presented to boot the wagyu was presented on a mostly empty slate plate but it was quite delicious although it could have been cooked a tad more the middle was too rare for my liking we finished up the meal with a fantastic serving of french strawberries with sorbet as a palate cleanser first dessert followed by a chocolate mousse served with earl grey ice cream and shards of different chocolates probably the heaviest dish of evening but a nice way to end the meal sated corner house is a more western oriented restaurant in the heart of so much delicious southeast asian cuisine but even if you have limited time here it is worth the stop to enjoy a cosmopolitan setting within the wilderness and a delicious meal to boot to me it feels like an appropriate representation of what singapore has become and it is worth making the trek out from the city center about a   minute drive to dine here\",\"i was taken here for a belated birthday lunch on a saturday afternoon the restaurant is situated in the botanic gardens and you may want to look up on how to get there because the garden is quite large i find the food here generally technically competent with flavor pairings quite fresh and a fusion of french and a teensy bit of modsin which i really enjoy the modsin here does not go too far and instead teases the diner here and there i had the amuse bouche prawn cracker and oyster leafnothing to shout about nice and crunchycarabinero prawn with tomatoesi would have loved to eat this with a local prawn but carabinero works too red on red went very well foie gras moussei loved the petal garnish but also well executed nothing extraordinary cod with crispy scalesthis i loved i have not eaten such crispy scales with no hint of oil and such a harmonious balance with the cod and the sauce also very aesthetically pleasing wagyuwell executed with a delicious onion thing my friend does not eat beef so they swapped it out with pork durian bread and butter puddingi felt the durian could have been stronger but overall very tasty and sweet petit fourssalted egg macarons were yum though the salted egg could have been heavier chocs were well good i love this place for their aesthetically pleasing food and its modsin influence i do feel it could be better by being a bit more daring the food here is really technically competent but could utilize more local produce love\",\"short review gourmet hawker center long review food is creative but not exhilarating ambiance is typical and very short of special hype is overwhelming with michelin accolades and table scarcity you can spend pp much more wisely than eating here biggest disappointments include uneven table lighting which led to many dark spots and light spots creating unnecessary contrast no photo pictures because of this lack of intimacy group table in the main dining room was extremely loud and shouting across from each other like it was a drunk wedding which the waitstaff did nothing to help the other annoyed patrons wishing for a quiet dinner overall casual atmosphere t shirt is and crocs allowed i would have felt a lot better about this place if people felt compelled to treat this place like a formal restaurant rather than a hawker center do not bother dressing nicely because you will certainly be overdressed with that in mind this is a restaurant not worthy of a special occasion instead go here to kick off a hen or stag party if you are keen on dropping   per person\",\"great food tasting menu business was perfect for lunch the menu was a little different and not sure that i even knew what some of the items were but trust the chef\",\"truly deserves the michelin star had gone there for their business lunch  course menu i think that is the most value for money way to try out the place its in an excellent location in the botanical gardens their food is a work of art i had the foie grais toothfish and the chef is interpretation of kaya toast everything was spectacular and amazing in taste highly recommended if you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to treat yourself to a great meal\",\"totally a restaurant that caught me off guard one that i saved towards the end of my sg upper tier restaurant binge highly recommended in every regard setting service food and creativity my girlfriend and i made a sunday dinner reservation where quite frankly i was expecting a typical french fusion restaurant that i see all over nyc london etc but there has to be a reason that it is top  in asia even though the list is totally hit or miss we arrived at the drop off location after a short period of getting lost make sure you go to the nassim gate location which is at nassim road and cluny road google maps took us to the other side of the botanic gardens at corner house gate which is the service entrance pretty cool to have a buggy waiting and greeting you by name for the short ride to the restaurant we sat down at a beautiful corner table and were immediately served with champagne followed with the menu we opted for the dinner discovery tasting menu which was a well portioned  course experience see image afterwards we were presented the wine menu which was extremely french heavy and what i thought was a very expensive list we did a nice bottle of hermitage i love restaurants that exceed expectations by a long shot every menu option was just wow not a single course that was not to my liking on top of the level of artistry in each the specific items that blew my mind were the interpretation of my favorite vegetables which was a few different snacks using onion each of which were surprisingly fantastic would you ever think an onion tea would be appetizing it was or onion with truffle or dried onion slices so good also was the chef jason is botanica which was simply an art piece should be in a museum somewhere lastly was his my favorite childhood food memory dessert with meringue crackers homemade pandan kaya and toasted bread which was totally out of this world anytime a top tier fusion restaurant includes local cuisine so prominently in their cooking i get happy service was impeccable the waiters were all very kind and friendly not a single ounce of stuffiness or pretentiousness that you might see at other restaurants of this caliber to add the final touch of perfection jason tan himself greeted us and bid us farewell as we finished our visit easily part of the top  favorite restaurants in all of asia highly recommend if on a date with someone special you are in the singapore botanic gardens after all a beautiful nice family dinner or a group get together\",\"fabulous food one of the best meals i have had in singapore great flavours and combinations service was excellent in total contrast to some other local establishments cough neonpigeon the brevity of this review does not do the place justice just go and make sure you order the melt in your mouth beef\",\"the entire experience at corner house really deserves   stars but because of the amazing food they got bumped up to  we had the discovery menu and highly recommend it the onion prepared four ways remains one of the most memorable dishes we have had to date all waitstaff professional and friendly we met the chef who is such a humble guy a really wonderful restaurant all round we will be sure to be back again and again\",\"i am so fond of this restaurant and it is got so much to do with the exceptional service they offered during our anniversary dinner my heel broke as i was getting out of the taxi and i carried my shoes to the entrance of the restaurant and asked if the had some tape or a stapler so i could perform surgery on my shoe the hostess took my shoe and told me to have a seat she fixed it in  minutes so i could climb the stairs to our table she was so sweet and really added to the memory of our first anniversary i am so thankful for her now to what i know most of you care about shoe repair food the menu was rather concise they offered the chefs tasting meal which had multiple choices for  per person or a more limited menu for  per person that included fewer items we started with a wonderful bottle of riesling for  please see my photos for more information on our meal which was absolutely delightful everything was prepared perfectly the textures and flavors blended perfectly and the service was phenomenal this place is great for a special occasion anniversary or birthday it is not very paleo friendly but it is definitely worth the cheat\",\"not to be mistaken for chubby hubby is chef jason tan helming a once historic and now culinary house that has seen the likes of au jardin les amis the team under him though a little unpolished will certainly shine in due course sophia hope i got her name right deserves special mention for her impeccable service the one thing that you should never pass on here has to be the breads the walnut bread classic french baguette and if you are lucky his version of ham chee peng were all brilliant whoever the bakery genius is behind those delicately delicious dough deserves a pay rise immediately but do limit yourself to only one serving of each and save room for the gastronomical journey that awaits after your sinful carbo loading jump start comes a plethora of amuse bouche that is if you are having the discovery menu that will further convince you that you have come to the right house the play on taste colour and texture awakens and heightens your senses in preparation for the courses that follow the highlights from the discovery menu has to be chef jason is botanica a curation of botanicals in a variety of preparations it is like fifty shades of vegetables in different doneness acidity hue and texture you will never look at a vegetarian dish in the same way again after consuming this artistically assembled selection of fibrous produce and just when you thought you have seen it all another humble vegetable a favourite of jason is is presented for you to eat in  ways the oignon doux des cvennes interpreted and transformed into a confit on crispy filo pastry a dehydrated thinly sliced onion a whole baked onion with sous vide egg and truffle and finally as an emulsion with earl grey infused onion tea hey this man knows likes his vegetables and you will too all before led me to the highest crescendo but alas two of three subsequent dishes that i will single out send me crashing rock bottom the cod with crispy scales was overcooked cold and bland the bresse pigeon was by far the worst dish of the night superlatively gamey and way bloodily undercooked the accompanying foie gras was obviously of the duck variety and tasted as such quite unpalatable is this becoming like a roller coaster ride can his desserts save him the answer is a resounding yes especially memorable were the salted egg macaron and the jackfruit mochi jason is definitely creative and these happy endings led me to give corner house a second chance and that second chance came in the form of citibank is  gourmet with swedish guest chef niklas ekstedt redemption time yes the pacing could have been a little better but somewhat understandable as they were running at full house am not sure if chef niklas upped jason is game but no fowl play today hooray this time around jason is free range chicken dish was licked cleaned and a five star upgrade from the inedible bresse pigeon dish that bombed so badly in the mouth his other solo effort was the scallop dish and again it showed that the overcooked cod might have been just a one off letdown having said that consistency is of the essence when it comes to dishing out michelin stars and the fifth from me will be awarded when consistency is achieved\",\"went for a lunch with some friends and the experience was lovely service staff was patient with our table of  food was delicious and plenty to fill us up particularly love the concept of sharing appetizers so we could try a few different dishes\",\"the  storey restaurant sets the mood for exquisite eating which i did not hesitate to replace the word for appropriateness instead fine dining is far too distant from my experience for which the place is less intimidating but harbor a sense of friendliness and a perfect spot for a daytime botanical meal the lunch is a quick meal intended with no fuss selection except for a top up if you want a riso pasta or a kaya toast as dessert a  course is priced at  while you may go for a luncheon discovery menu which offers a  course at  when you have a more generous lunch hour we were led to our table swiftly and they were very attentive to our needs we were given amble time to decide on our choices and we were brief on the idea behind the dishes and the assembles on our plate each time we were served that is the whole service i give honor to as i care extensively about what i eat and how they flavored my dining exposure they came around with a bread basket piling with fresh baguette and wholegrain slices for you to pick out i was look forward to the small heap of yves bordier french butter very rich and creamy like we did sprinkle a few sea salt flakes on your buttered bread and bon apptit we were presented with the marinated norwegian salmon trout for a start i am not a big fan of any cured fish except for certain meat nevertheless the teaser was not a turn off but was quite lovely given a gentle sweet hint in the creme sauce underneath the bed of salad pyramid with onions celery strips while the petit flying fish roe went popping in my mouth the salmon is nice without a fishy note very nicely cured i had the free range chicken instead of the riso pasta supplement of  the latter reminds me of orzo pasta which i once had at the waterfall cafe and am still liking it i did not want too much carbs so the chicken dish appeals to me the free range chicken has a very fine texture baby tender like a juvenile the skin is lightly pan seared although its thick fatty tissue is somewhat freaking me out jason uses a mix of white and yellow corn kernels for the key flavor which heightens the taste a notch further with natural sweetness the foam like i guess was supposedly the poultry emulsion patterning the plate i tasted the impressive the interpretation of kaya toast supplement of  and was feeling complete the taste of gula melaka has made a strong statement in the dessert while the pandan scent has went into hidding i love the intensity of the coconut palm sugar mirroring the chendol we once knew the muscovaldo sand bits adds bites to the cream along with the citrus element in the yuzu sorbet heavenly match alternatively you may choose to go with the soursoup sorbet which is no inferior than the kaya toast it has a smooth texture with a robust soursoup accent that arrived with a sweet indication not overly nectarous when accompanied by a bed of morello cherry compote the pretty looking meringue extends a light crunch to the frictionless construction it gives you a soft and dainty closure to your afternoon meal however if you adore a loud booming ending go for the kaya toast which conferred a long lasting impression as it did on me oh they have free buggy service ring them up and check on the pick up within the botanic garden bon appetit yelpers\",\"super nice environment in the middle of the magnificent singapore botanical garden very excellent food courteous professional service the day we were there even the suitcase chef owner was there and was very pleasant\",\"this was me and justin b is fancy dinner while on our trip to singapore and it did not disappoint first off the location is awesome within the botanical gardens so its really pretty and tranquil but note that i do not recommend taking the lrt to get here because once you exit the station its a long walk to the restaurant through the gardens and in the singapore heat humidity its not that fun haha after walking to work up an appetite for dinner haha the restaurant itself is so cute its just like a house with cool modern ish decor making reservations online was easy and no problem in getting availability about  weeks in advance we were seated on the nd floor window table which overlooked the gardens for a nice atmosphere service throughout the meal was outstanding too as justin b noticed you know that you are in a nice restaurant when its the kind of place that folds your napkin for you when you get up to use the restroom haha everyone was so attentive to our needs and each dish was explained to us in detail that we definitely felt taken care of i mean after our meal we decided to taxi instead of walk back to the lrt so they called a cab for us and drove us in a golf cart down to the gate so that we didnt have to walk more as for the meal itself we both opted to go all out and ordered the discovery menu and the wine pairings to go with it haha every dish was a visual masterpiece the presentation was so beautiful and some dishes like the vegetable garden which had some like  ingredients in it was almost too pretty to eat haha the taste of the food was actually really good too though haha while every dish didnt wow me they were all good and tasty the pork jowl beef and cocoa pebble dessert were my faves though and they send you home with a tin of madeline cookies that were really good the wine pairing turned out really well for us too very generous pours and it was practically a diff wine with each dish so i felt that was worthwhile to do just the overall price point about  usd per person and i wasnt overwhelmingly impressed with each dish holds me back from the full  star rating but if you want a nice fancy dinner in singapore i would still recommend corner house\",\"thanks yelp you helped me find my favorite hainanese chicken rice place in the world so far got a quarter chicken and rice set for   which confuses me since that is actually quite expensive and i hear people say   in other reviews did it go up or did i do something wrong price aside my first bite of the rice which looked like plain white rice btw was chickeny rice heaven chicken was perfectly juicy soup was good and i am sold i almost always have trouble finishing the rice at other places but i gobbled every last bit of the meal tried tian tian and ah tai and still rate this highest in terms of overall taste in a set obviously at  it is twice as expensive tian tians chicken was just as juicy but the sauce and the rice was not comparable to here\",\"delish inexpensive and good fast food  for a good hainesese chicken rice i would recommend anyone who wants to get into the world of hcr by trying some of the locals here everyone has their own tastes but this version is lighter compared to others in the market oh and be warned the spicy chili sauce is super spicy but complements well with the ginger sauce and chicken oh so yum\",\"simply delicious and fast servicechicken and rice are full of flavor   sgd rice is essential to go with the chicken as hungry as i was quarter to half chicken would satsfiy me\",\"ate here twice on our trip a hidden gem and super cheap something about that rice mixture with the sauce and chicken yummy and simple it is not as heavy and is has more of a balanced profile food comes out stupidly quick as well\",\"when you are in singapore you gotta have their hainanese chicken dropped by this place after a recommendation and it definitely held up to its name we ordered both types of chicken regular and barbecue the chicken was very tender and it was placed over fragrant rice with a delicious bowl of chicken soup on the side its a great place for a cheap yet delicious meal on the go\",\"my favorite chicken rice to go place it is been there for like ever and they have a constant flow of customers just make sure if you want roasted chicken you come before pm or it would be sold out\",\"i ventured out on my own yesterday and was out and about i was in the area for laduree and was hungry after about  hours of if i was ready to feast i searched my bookmarks and walked about  minutes to get to here the reviews and good ratings were justified the place was packed i actually had to wait to be seated like w all the food stalls service and ambiance is non existent i would question cleanliness as well however as i watched the patrons devour their food i was excited and very eager to finally have lunch the lady asked if i wanted roast chicken or steamed chicken steamed of course my order came out in like  minutes and for the st time my bottle of water was actually cold the rice was fluffy the chicken was super tender and the broth was flavorful the dipping sauce had a kick to it literally after all of the meals we have had expensive street casual american whatever this was my favorite meal it is no wonder the folks here are not overweight the portions are super small to what i am used to fear not though because i had about  macarons right after my lunch\",\"this place has been around forever and correspondingly i have not been back in years now that i am working in the area i had to give them another try the lunch lines can be long but things move quickly and you should not need to wait ages for a seat just be prepared to share a table with another group if the restaurant gets crowded now for the food i ordered the steamed or white chicken thigh which is served with fragrant rice and a bowl of soup i also ordered a side of vegetables what surprised me was that the chicken here was great jelly like skin always a good sign super tender meat and very flavorful sauce the rice paled in comparison it was oily but did not have much of the fragrance you would expect the vegetables were alright a little on the salty side but nothing to write home about i would come back to have that chicken again and maybe try the roast chicken lastly it is a mom and pop shop so cash is king that would be the case for almost every small eatery in singapore but just thought i would point it out for the many tourists who visit the area it is kinda expensive for what you get but it is also in the orchard road area so i should adjust my expectations\",\"my all time favourite hainanese white chicken rice love thier salted veg duck soup avoid lunch time also fully booked\",\"not a bad place to check out in singapore my husband wanted to check out the chicken and rice scene in this country while we were honeymoon ing we got the roasted and steamed chicken which were alright in my opinion could not really taste the difference but my husband preferred the roasted chicken however the broth soup you dip the chicken into it was phenomenal definitely my favorite during our visit here next up duck soup my husband heard that this was good so gave it a go i had it almost immediately when it we got it and almost burned of my tongue the flavor itself was alright it was tomato y and tart which i am not huge on yet it was warm and comforting to drink the soup the duck wad alright overall the experience was good and a great catch pricewise would consider coming back if we are in the area again\",\"i was expecting a lot from this place especially after looking at the reviews over here sadly i was disappointed for the price of  i paid the value of the meal i had chicken rice with a plate of liver failed to hit my mark why the quality of the chicken is just so so and the small portion did not help much the liver did not taste nice and my friend agreed with me other than that everything else was normal nothing special about it while sitting near the counter i saw many articles raving about this place but after finishing my meal i wonder to myself you have to be kidding right but i wo not ruled this place out for my future chicken rice meals perhaps will drop by again to give it another try best is not to come during meal times as it is often crowded and the queue can be quite long fortunately i came at the right time  plus there were a few vacant tables and service was fast not the friendliest staff but got my meals pretty quickly however for the price i paid i am disappointed\",\"it took me a while to find this place via google map it is in the mall and on th is floor otherwise you may find similar restaurant but for thailand food toasted chicken are only available in the morning and i missed it white chicken tastes delicious fresh rice seems saulted nice but not enough for me soup just so so only cash supported alipay or other payment method not supported as chinese i say it worth trying eco dinner\",\"i do not see what is they hype over this chicken rice store the chicken is hard and not juicy the rice is dry and feels like eating a normal plate of white rice the price is also more expensive than normal chicken rice to make the whole experience worst the uncle taking our orders is very rude and arrogant overall the whole experience is sub par and not worth the money and your calories intake at all you can definitely find better eateries in orchard area\",\"it is quick and conveniently located in orchard st mall traditional chicken and rice no frills but it was my only option to try that dish in my short trip traditionally it is just in some ginger broth no skin many places had variations but i am not well versed enough\",\"when asking for the menu the lady responds with a condescending we do not have a menu just chicken rice well ok there is menu on window with some other items so just a fyi food is good but i have found they are mostly the same everywhere the best being the five star hainanese but it is just too far edit bumped up after revisiting\",\"yay yelp singapore i have been waiting patiently for you for the last six years i came here twice on my last visit to the island nation thanks to a rec from a foodie singaporean who claimed this place had the best chicken rice in the land well after two visits i think he might be right or at very least it has to be near the top of the list hainanese delicacy is at the very top of far east plaza hidden amongst a random assortment of hair salons and older food outlets and far away from the trendy shops downstairs this place is old school cramped quarters tables shared with others and dirt cheap prices very crowded at lunch as it seems popular with those who work nearby the chicken itself was melt in your mouth delicious the rice full of oily flavor all incredibly delicious when topped with thick soy sauce and chili free bowl of broth on the side we ordered a side of pea sprouts and these were great too you have the option of getting steamed or roasted but steamed is traditional so that is what we went with so good i could have easily eaten there many more times and i will again on my next trip back\",\"at  floor at far east orchard rdthere are  tables and long q you should go before  am or after  pm if you do not want to wait the steam chicken so yummy the duck soup is nice recommend\",\"excellent chicken rice located in a shopping area patronized by locals diners are also locals no fancy tableware but very clean had white boiled and roasted brown with slight hint of herb chicken very good and simple soup\",\"ate here the previous night after watching star wars the force awakens aww yea with  male friends the  of us ordered a full white chicken  and a plate of vegetables i am not sure about the individual cost of each plate of rice and the vegetables but it was  in total seems relatively pricey but for a shop in expensive town area the value is decent and yes we were all pretty full after our meal so you can judge the proportions for your next meal the meat is soft and tender and generally deboned although there were some portions with bones but they were not a huge hassle to eat rice is fragrant and soup is not entirely plain there is the taste of chicken bones and other ingredients not a bad place though but for the price i rather go somewhere else yes i am stingy nonetheless if you find yourself in town and would like a relatively more budget meal without cutting down on quality this is a good place\",\"i would not call this place the best chicken rice but it is definitely one of the most nostalgic one cause it has been around since long long time ago a nice place to go for comfort food tender chicken on top of fragrant rice that goes perfectly well with their home made ginger and chilli sauces their salted vegetable duck soup is my favourite never fails to warm your tummy and tickles your taste bud\",\"i am sure this is one of the hidden gems in singapore you really have to know about this place if you seriously like whiskey once you will step into this bar located at the rendezvous hotel you might think that you are in whiskey heaven the selection of single malts from all venerable producers going all the way back into s if not before is simply stunning there are probably a thousand of different types of scotch and whiskey on the list many available strictly by the bottle to the delight of the aficionados there are also multiple tasting flights offered giving an opportunity to experience true variety i took smoke around the world flight which included whiskey from islay france ireland and india the bar also offers a private room which where you can enjoy scotch with cigar but this room should be booked in advance if you like whiskey this is a must experience in singapore\",\"great selection of whiskeys located on the nd floor of rendezvous hotel auld alliance is one of the best whiskey bars in singapore with a huge selection of common and rare whiskeys to try the menu is as thick as a dictionary and unless you are a whiskey aficionado yourself ask for recommendations from the friendly staff i had a tasting fleet of japanese whiskey  santory hibiki harmony yamazaki reserve nikka coffey grain my fav  yoichi nas they were all good and selling for  i think if you want a quiet place to decompress after a long day at work or simply to indulge in your me time give this place a go you can thank me later\",\"lovely ambiance leather chesterfield couches mood lighting and lots of whisky a few cocktails wine and champagne for the non whisky drinkers too the drinks menu is the size of a novel staff are friendly and helpful refilling water glasses discussing whisky choices etc\",\"ye canna hand a man a granda spanna if you can translate that you are off to a good start if you can say it  times quick you belong here i have been here on dates and wif mates and it never fails to get a belter mense hoora good pure dead brilliant and the always welcome braw that leather bound tome in front of you that looks like the good book is just that so if you have never had whisky before my advice is to just glen the fiddich out of there with date we went for a whisky flight because we would already been elsewhere and did not want to destroy the wallets totally or not get home from memory you get  tasting glasses they are mls or so and they are reasonably priced with mates we were bein all bum and parsley as whisky wankers do and so it got pricey real quick some clever chaps went the cocktail and they were done for the night the rest of us got mad wae it and the night disappeared from there along with all the pictures i took ken fit like\",\"this little gem is amazing wish i had found as soon as i arrived tried absinthe for the first time delicious ambiance is dark soothing and comfortable service is impeccable interesting eats next door and downstairs beautiful ladies coming in alone to read a book and enjoy a glass of whiskey tell me this establishment is as safe as it is classy i will not visit singapore without making ample time to visit my new home away from home\",\"if i could own a bar it would be this bar not for the ambiance but for the simple fact that it had the most whiskey i have seen exposed in a room of all ages genres and origins just a lovely place\",\"my girlfriends and i visited the auld alliance last friday and all in all it was a great atmosphere to catch up in a relatively quiet bar the decor brings to mind the era of mad men with their rich leather sofas and bottles upon bottles of whiskeys lining the floor to ceiling shelves for whiskey selection the auld alliance gets  stars they have every kind of whiskey you could imagine from all over world try their whiskey tasters if you would like to sample a bit of each they have preselected tasters that are fair in terms of value and quality the reason for the ultimate  star review is simply the operations of this bar and my own personal preference the bar was nearly empty when we first arrived around pm yet the entire couch seating area was reserved that is fair enough but when we left around   pm it was still empty they declined to let us sit in the reserved seats and had us at the bar but i was peeved by the fact that it would seem we would have been just fine out in the regular seating area my second bone to pick is how strict and unyielding they are about the cocktails they have roughly  or so selections to choose from should you want a cocktail i asked if a sazerac could be made a cocktail with deep whiskey roots in the u s they could have made this but again declined i get that they are trying to make a point that this is all about the whiskey and not cocktail but frankly i do not like my bars all that up tight\",\"probably the best selection of whiskies in singapore but it is really too bad you have to go through a retail podium of the hotel rendezvous with a bizarrely assembled tenant mix it felt like i was going to a lan shop or something anyway i guess it is really  stars for the scotch but  stars for their landlord\",\"this place is heaven i could spend a whole day here but i would probably be wasted i cannot recommend this place more\",\"since my wife has started trying single malt whisky is i almost feel guilty about being scottish and not drinking whisky a recent yelp event involved whisky from the auld alliance which impressed us both so inevitably a trip to the auld alliance was on the cards in a non descript nd floor shop in the rendezvous hotel we waited until the whisky hour of pm was upon us and nervously stepped inside we stepped into a different world a world that seemed from the previous century as the place is furnished with old chesterfield couches and shelves loaded with whisky is from around the world we took a seat at the bar and opened what can only be described as the war and peace of menu is spoilt for choice we narrowed down to the tasting selection some start from  for a sample of four whisky is we selected some of the older scotched and settled down for our selection to arrive not only did the glasses arrive but our server brought out the bottles for us to see with instructions on how and in what order to taste she managed to avoid nodding off to my stories of my youth living close to bonded warehouses which were loaded to the roof with expensive whisky and guarded by ferocious geese this is true btw anyway the sample glasses were marvelous and we left an hour later aglow and rambling that we would need to do this again great experience and great service\",\"if i had a man cave it would look like this old library decor with a fantastic selection of scotch and whiskies i did the scotch tasting flights and they used well polished riedel glasses which added to my enjoyment my total bill was not cheap but but class comes with a price tag this place is a real treat with top notch selection available by the glass highly recommended\",\"what is there to say that has not been said this place definitely has the greatest selection of whiskies in singapore if not asia and is a strong contender for the world as well the karuisawa selection alone takes   pages in font size  and the stuff cannot be found anywhere even at auction today although the proud display of many  year old spirits check out their facebook page might make it sound like a place for those with deep wallets they also offer very decent cocktails and tasting selections which make it a must visit even for the more normal of us who will never get a chance to sip on the moonshine distilled in  plenty of special bottlings for the mid high range too it can get a little quiet on week nights and the area is not exactly boat quay but that just means you can get a seat and enjoy your whisky in peace a must visit for any whisky enthusiast\",\"yaaaaaaas remember that part in anchorman when ron burgundy goes i have many leather bound books and my apartment smells of rich mahogany well the auld alliance is new digs in the rendevous hotel says just that just imagine comfy leather couches dark woodsy tones complemented by a variety of golden hues from all the beautiful whiskies into cigars they have a specially ventilated room that you can rent out for a minimum spend of   i am assuming that is  sgd and you can enjoy the ultimate one true pairing of whisky cigars the menu is a binder with page after page of everything they got if you find yourself overwhelmed or need an introduction to whisky the friendly staff can easily recommend something their tasting portions are pretty good value for money they start at around  and you get to sample  whiskies you can choose from themes such as tastes of scotland american styles and  yo japanese styles to name a few the pour is  ml each about half of what they would give you if you ordered per glass what solidifies their  star rating for me is their customer service right after ordering  tastings my husband had something to attend to and could not stick around deciding to ride the wagon of responsibility instead of drinking  glasses of whisky i took a chance by asking the staff if there was any way i could take the samples home i was expecting stank looks and a resounding no but they surprisingly said it was possible and put  samples in small containers and get this they even put the effort into labeling them i was happy that they were able to come through with my unusual request and in the end my husband was able to enjoy the whiskies in the comfort of our own home for that the auld alliance has my business\",\"auld alliance is not just one of the best whiskey bars in singapore but in the world their collection of whiskeys is just jaw dropping just see the above pictures no explanation needed despite auld alliance is mystique as this high class upscale establishment it is quite affordable for those on a budget or are allergic to singapore is high priced alcoholic beverages i would advise you order the sgd  set of whiskies the sets which includes three shots worth of four different whiskies vary from around the world ie four whiskies from different parts of the world collection of scottish whiskies ie scotch american whiskies japanese whiskies etc depending on your alcohol tolerance this is just enough to give you a nice buzz i think the best part for non whiskey connoisseurs the menu gives a wonderful description of exactly what you are tasting the bartender is the man the atmosphere is second to none think old world speakeasy honestly i think it is one of the best places to hold a conversation where you can really get a chance to know your significant partner and business partner whatever the case maybe i would give six stars if i could\",\"thoroughly impressed with this bar not to give too much of its allure have to be there to appreciate away it is extremely well decorated and inviting for the archetypal whiskey scotch drinker a little cold though\",\"the rave reviews of auld alliance are well deserved and still do not do it justice it is hard to believe auld alliance is not mentioned in every travel magazine and blog for its selection of whisky scotch and other spirits the menu is literally a binder chock full of pages from affordable pours to the unattainable  plus year old scotch while the selection is enough to get you in the door and keep you there for hours depending on your bank account the leather couches and dark wood interior harkens back to the days of gentlemen in formalwear sitting on plush wingback chairs enjoying cigars and brandy while debating social matters of the day this is the modern incarnation of that scene without any of the pretension this is a must if you are in singapore whether you enjoy whisky scotch or a cigar very few places anywhere in the world can match what auld alliance offers\",\"what a gem stopped in on a sunday evening with a couple of buddies after bookmarking it after reading some of the reviews i am not a whiskey guy but had a blast with the sampler options tried the scottish sampler and the tour of the world it really helped to be there with a scottish guy who talked me through the choices but it was a great place to hang out the huge selection the comfortable leather couches and very attentive staff made it one of my new favourite boys night out places\",\"it is hard enough to find a quiet place to sip away at an average cocktail let alone enjoy the peaceful conversation at a barely audible volume while sipping on fine aged whisky so it is a wonderful thing to find yourself in the auld alliance the walls are covered in the finest selections of whisky the drinks menu comes in a leather bound volume and high rollers could lounge in a cigar room at the back away from the common crowd which to be frank is nothing like the common crowd you would see anywhere else the dim lights and earthy tones coupled with the soft tunes brings speak easys to mind only with an astoundingly huge selection of fine whisky as well they also serve a sweet selection of absinthe served properly with a sugar cube a dripper it is most definitely a place for quiet decadence and i highly recommend the spot\",\"one of the classiest places i have been to not in a dressed up kind of way but in the hospitality and knowledgeable conversation kind of way i hear the old location was bigger and better than this current one came in with a few friends i had been looking forward to this place since a friend from high school posted it on facebook it did not disappoint from the dcor of wall to wall bottles of whiskey to leather sofas all around to the hidden cigar room behind the shelves of vintage scotches and whiskeys auld alliance felt like the place for me we had several drinks here i opted for a couple of glasses of absinthe it was presented in a very traditional way sans flame the glass itself was modeled after a french style goblet with a chamber where see pictures the best part of the evening besides the company we kept was the conversation was a french guy about why the scotches were served in a stemmed glass we discussed the science behind why it was this way hand warmth ruins the experience as the scotch and whiskeys lose its flavor among other things turns out this french guy was one of the owners very humble pleasant guy i will make another visit when i return later this year perhaps class it up in the hidden cigar room and really do it well\",\"wow this really is as good as it gets in terms of selection decor and service auld alliance has the best selection of scotch i have seen on any continent and i could spend an hour easily going through the menu fortunately they have quite a few flights that will make it easier for a first timer and you can also get half drams as well if you are looking to imbibe less or in my case find an excuse to try twice as many where do i start scotland the home of scotch or to japan where some of the best scotch whiskeys are coming from these days i really appreciate the deep selection with old vintages as well as a many bottles from distilleries which have closed e g port ellen karuizawa etc the one thing you wo not find here is a deep selection of american whiskeys such as bourbons and ryes but that is ok you are here to drink scotch whiskey and the atmosphere is fitting low lighting plush leather seats stools and coaches and walls of eye candy uh if scotch is your thing a great place to come with friends or solo any scotch lover or anyone looking to learn more about scotch should definitely come here\",\"if you are anywhere in downtown singapore take a cab get a grab walk or crawl to bar stories and you can thank me later an absolute must stop for anyone who wants an educational experience while sampling some of the best drinks around first they are no bartenders they are mixologists scientists there is no menu rather they start a conversation with you about your likes and dislikes are from there they build you a custom artesian cocktail their assortment of liquors are so eclectic and diverse you may not recognize a single bottle on their shelves my advice be open and honest with your tastes and you will be rewarded the bar is not super obvious to find but yelp is map will get you really close when the map says you are there look up and there is a small bar stories sign look for a glass door and walk upstairs i recommend you sit at the at for the complete experience with the mixologists that way you will get the story on how they are making you cocktail since yelp limits you to  stars for a review that is what i gave them however in reality they deserve\",\"so this is the most hipster bar in singapore the bar has no sign that i could see it is on the second floor and looks like an apartment i do not mind those things and the drink was not bad but they do not have a menu and the drink i had i finished in  sips now the part that really disappointed me  about a  sing for two drinks that is crazy\",\"an interesting concept of no menu but a conversation with the customer our drinks were great and the staff were even better if you want a quiet place with interesting patrons and a unique cocktail to enjoy in this historic area of singapore i recommend you check out bar stories\",\"this place lives forever in my heart so cozy and the bartenders have so much cocktail knowledge they know their shit this place is in my top  cocktails bars in the world they do not have a menu you tell them what you like and somehow they always read you right i have been going over the past  years and they have yet to prove me wrong last week when i went they made a mango sticky rice cocktail for me i love mango and sticky rice but they did not know that i just wanted to write again about them because they are great amazing etc fin\",\"i have been to this restaurant once the food is delicious especially the dessert thank god\",\"coolest bar ever speakeasy vibes no menus they customize your drinks according to what flavors you tell them both of our mixologists came up with creative cocktails that were amazing one of them even asked if he could put sake in my drink even though i did not tell him but i was just thinking it he read my mind i could not be happier keep in mind they do take their time making your cocktails but it is all worth it\",\"i cannot recommend this bar enough my husband and i love quirky and unique bars this has to be on the top of our list the vibe the people and drinks all were memorable we will definitely be regular more if we lived in the city the bartenders were friendly cared for what you wanted and liked and gave something to match our tastebuds one of the best cocktails i have ever had\",\"second floor location small barreservation acceptedquality craft cocktailscredit card accepteddetailed bartendersno menu takes your order based on your preferencesmall food menu availablein the mist of the indian neighborhood\",\"great space and bartenders they clearly have the extensive knowledge base to pull off the bespoke drinks brilliantly looks like it may get packed later in the evenings but we snuck in early and there was plenty of room\",\"stumbled across bar stories on my last night in singapore i was actually looking to take a car across town to some other cocktail joint that i had looked up on the line i think the life lesson here is that sometimes the thing you look for that seems so distant is right in front of you all along bar stories is personal charming and exhibits a passion for cocktails that you really do not see much of any more my first cocktail was presented to me in michelin star fashion detailing not only the flavors and ingredients but the inspiration behind it i enjoyed my visit and this was a great end to my experiences here before i fly back tomorrow morning\",\"back in the day i would have given bar stories  stars alas times have moved on and they are still a very solid cocktail bar but does not wow me anymore they used to be impossible to get into without a reservation and i am happy to report that when i visited at  on a friday we were seated right away since every cocktail is made to order it is nice how they take the time to listen to your preferences and make something you will enjoy just be quite specific about what you like so they can include all those elements i find that they do very well with their fruit forward cocktails and have a penchant for burning herbs for that smoky flavor i will continue to come back for the good memories and solid drinks but until they wow me it will be pretty hard to call this my favorite cocktail bar\",\"waiting for the party to arrive we decided that an individualized thirst quencher will help start my dinner yuzu with cucumber bitters elderberry and a couple of other personalized spirits that contributed to a much calmer well being important for a jet lagged body appetizers were different shimeiji fries which we thought were tasty but wished for the cilantro calamansi mayo to have more cilantro and calamansi but still delightful the seabass pate was pleasant curried mussels a big hit we note that their sauces and blended gravies are super tasty wish we had more mantou to schlepp it up with charred golden pomfret had a certain homey singapore momma cooking kind of homey taste to it which tantalized my taste buds and my memories loved it it is a keeper for the menu love the new bar storiesabsolutely love the made for me\",\"bar stories is a very cool cocktail bar frequented by celebrities and without a menu drinks are made based on your vague desires and the whims of the bartenders this ultra personalisation comes at a hefty price alongside very slow service the poor bartenders were completely rammed on the saturday night and seemed a little stressed out we could not get another order in and given every cocktail order was meant to be a cheerful negotiation having cocktail makers who are overloaded makes the whole experience less pleasant i suspect if you came here on a quiet sun weds night this would be a chill  experience the model just does not quite work delicious though the cocktails are when they are busy\",\"one of my favourite bars in singapore staff are helpful friendly and provide great recommendations for cocktails\",\"no menu bars are either a hit or miss bar stories was a fabulous discovery but it was not all smooth sailing came here early on a friday around pm and was surprised that no one else was in the upstairs bar we are americans but it is way past the it is  o clock somewhere people hint usually people do not go drinking until after  pm we noticedi loved their ambiance and setup haji lane is known for being a hipster part of bugis and it is packed with kitschy kooky boutiques and trinket stores as well as poppin and packed chill bars and outdoor happy hours i have visited twice and both times were full of laughing customers beer drinking and dart throwing damn those kids thankfully bar stories is up above on the second floor and away from the loud edm sloppy messes downstairs we were the first customers that late afternoon early evening and loved the wooden steps ac and loungey chairs there was no menu and basically my advice to you yelpers is to be very specific about what kind of drink you like cool you like citrus well what kind grapefruit lemon orange or pink lemonade you like sweet well do you like peach strawberry cherry or grape i was looking for a tequila mezcal drink with a refreshing and smoky hint to it not sweet at all and not too citrus y i mentioned that i love blackberry and anything with berry in it my bartender made me a delicious tequila drink with lemon juice and lots of additional crazy going on with kaffir leaves think thai food and a dried bamboo for aesthetic it was milky like foam texture on the surface but a smooth and refreshing sipper love shoutout to the bartender even though it took literally   minutes it was worth the wait my sister is drink was not as well received i am chuckling as i think back to it but the bartender that day said that he was going to make it with peach and vodka since she wanted a vodka drink that was sweet he also mentioned another fruit that she liked and she though cool rad i love all those things oh boy the final combination was a cherry bomb of kool aid flavor not the business we felt bad asking him to remake it since each drink averaged around   and that is an insane price even when i go out in san francisco i would not dream of paying over  for a beautifully crafted cocktail but singapore has different standards as i came to understand throughout my stay service is pretty much in the creation of your drink they spend a solid  minutes on your drink but there are not cocktail servers walking around since the space itself is pretty tiny in addition to the main space by the bar there was also a back room that holds larger parties but i can definitely see this place crowding up when it gets packed it can be a great spot for a intimate conversation or even a small gathering for a gno but personally i would not squeeze up in here with a large party too much work to get everybody up in the birdhouse\",\"be sure to stop by this bar on haji lane if you like unique cocktails it is not a fancy bar by any means but the cocktails are there is no menu you just tell the bartender what type of drinks you prefer and what liquor to use and he concocts a delicicous and fun cocktail\",\"love love love the concept but word on the street and actual reality is a wee bit different so the tour guide who told us about this bar said the concept was based around telling the bartender your life story and he would make a cocktail for you based on your life story reality is that he comes and consults with you on the flavours and tastes you like sweet sour spicy etc and then suggests a cocktail based on your answers you can veto his suggestions if as an example you do not like the fact that gin is involved but hey would you tell michelangelo how to paint all of  of us just had a great evening and there were some great surprises when the drinks finally came out we all tasted each others my fave was this amazing cardamom gin that tasted incredible as will as this non alcoholic cranberry drink that had a chili kick at the end prices were totally dependent on the alcohol involved the cocktails ranged from s   and the mocktails were from s   all i can say is go go go\",\"i do not drink unless its half a glass of red wine i do not drink unless worst case scenario its a very special occasion and i should be toasting with family and friends i do not drink unless i am at bar stories this is the coolest place ever i have actually added it to the top of everyones lists of places to go when visiting singapore this is where i want to have every first date because its just such an awesome concept you literally can request your hearts desire of a cocktail and have it made for you right in front of your eyes its such a wonderful experience because it allows you to get creative and feel like you have somehow involved yourself in the creation that the extremely talented individuals here have mustered up for you by calling out a theme the only downside would be that the drinks take a while to make but you can watch them do it in awe and to be honest its an excuse for me to drink slower hah also you can see the love and time they put into making the masterpiece which is your drink and watch everyone else is faces light up in receiving their own godly creation the staff there are so friendly daring you on to do your worst as if they are just bursting to come up with something new and when they did make the cocktails most of the time it was something completely innovative that they had just come up with on the spot very impressive the flavours we had last time were something chocolatey served in an actually nutella jar something with pineapple strawberry and white chocolate my favourite flavours and actually the best cocktail of my life fruity with fire and fire there was lychee champagne and peanut butter which turned into peanut butter with a shot of jelly grape liquor which was delicious also a mahoosive pink pocky stick was added to the mix presentation is on point here the following time i had come i was the first to arrive and i got to come around the bar and shake a drink so sorry to the poor guy at the receiving end of that one which was sweet that time i got given this chocolate concoction surrounded by chocolate sauce ice cream and chocolate biscuits have a look at the photo crazy next time i will be back with better flavours i have got something with cheesecake up my sleeve\",\"there is definitely a craft being performed here so try and think of something you would really like to try or ask the bartender to make something while you tell him your favorite types of ingredients i got a little creative with my choice and had rasberries gin rosemary and something else i cannot remember cris had tequila lemon lemon grass and pepper both of the drinks were amazing i am gonna research my next choices and arrive prepared on the next order also the place is easy to miss it is located on the second floor at haji lane with a small door leading to a stairwell keep your eye out\",\"no drink menu you just tell them what you are feeling like be open to different variations i ordered a bourbon old fashioned and could not have been happier with the finished product\",\"i loved the aquarium i had fun it was amazing it was well worth the advance purchase online to avoid the long lines and it helped it was a little cheaper than at the ticket counter this aquarium is located in sentosa island we took the cable cars here since it is located towards the back by the cable car exit as you enter the aquarium you walk through a heat scan for coronavirus at least it is better safe than sorry the aquarium size is pretty big and all surrounded by water my favorite part was seeing the shark tank full of different sized sharks these were amazing to see my other favorite was seeing the jellyfishes i got stung by them and just wanted to see these gentle but vicious sea creatures i saw some ugly and unique sea creatures the glass walls of these tanks were at least five inches thick the staff here really takes care of this place i saw one guy in a wet suit wiping the glass walls carefully to not disturb the fish great place to visit if you are a tourist and first time in singapore well worth my advance purchase\",\"top  attractions in singapore i have been to several aquariums around the world something about the deep mysteries of the sea fascinates me with more than   marine animals of over   species across into  different habitats sea aquarium is definitely worth the visit what you should not miss out check the time and stick around for the feeding at the main aquarium here you will see scuba divers feeding the manta rays and other marine animals inside sea aquarium is a great attraction for all ages i spent a good two to three hours inside another favorite of mine was seeing the sheer size of the giant japanese spider crab the location is adjacent to universal studios so if it may be possible to visit both parks in a single day\",\"the aquarium is on a fun part of the country called sentosa island seems like a fun place to bring kids on a nice family day the aquarium is a little smaller than i thought it would be and incredibly hectic as you would expect most aquariums to be the reason i gave this place at  star was because i saw three dead or dying fish not saying that fish can never die but for a fish to get that dud and to be seen by the public eye does not happen over a few minutes or even a few hours and seldomly even half a day to a day those large fish had to have been dead long enough for caretakers of the place to not notice although they have a decent selection i cannot look past the dead fish since i have never seen that an aquarium before definitely took videos but did not take pictures of the dead fish\",\"one of the best aquariums i have ever been to although the universal studios next door probably pulls larger crowds this aquarium is definitely a ppace worth stopping by especially if you want to avoid the head outside on a hot singaporean summer day located on sentosa island s e a aquarium is a bit out of the ways for people visiting the main island of singapore despite that fact given how small singapore is it does not take that long to get over here i rode over on a grab ride for only  singaporean dollars so if distance is your big worry fear not as for the attractions i think the aquarium is pretty comprehensive it has exhibits on almost all the oceans of the world except for the arctic and the aquarium with stingrays is particularly beautiful visit if you are close by\",\"s e a was definitely one of the best aquariums i have ever visited it is on sentosa island it was large but very walkable there were so many sights that i lost track of how far we had gone some of my favorites the jellyfish displays were beautiful i loved the way they lit that those tanks they are such weird creatures with such variety the glass tunnel inside the shark tank everyone loved this display sharks were swimming all around you even above we were able to see the underbelly of these predators they were swimming so close that we could look right into their eyes feedings happen at certain times at the giant central tank make sure you do not miss it the diver was feeding the fish that were swarming him one of the tanks had a shipwreck in it it provided great hiding places for the critters there were other general tanks that housed a variety of fish the colors and mix was extraordinary if you are visiting sentosa make sure to carve out some time to go to the aquarium\",\"this is a nice aquarium but it was extremely crowded i could not fully enjoy this place and rushed through it i did not want to knock it to three stars because this is a really nice aquarium the jellies are a great section and i love the underwater walkway do not miss the giant wall of sea creatures either it is phenomenal if you buy the bundle online you can get tickets here for free\",\"i choose this as fauna part of the attraction to my singapore itenary compared to the bird park zoo river and night safari is which all hold certain titles and awards the sea had more animals that were pertinant to the area around singapore and the south seas it is building lies on the lovely but commercialized island of sentosa which neighbors universal studios premise itself was large and maintained glasses above made you feel as though you were really in the ocean the best part was actually the first part which was the tunnel of sharks it contained various shark species like the nurse and hammerhead sharks other galleries pertained to fishes and creatures mostly within the malaca straights and south indo seas one thing this aquarium could have were more mammals and birds\",\"decent sized aquarium this one is unique because they have other exhibits besides just looking at fish and sharks they have an old wooden ship on display and have a quick movie too for  the staff were very knowledgeable and answered a lot of my questions i am used to seeing aquariums being super packed with kids and families but i came in when there were not as much people although there were lots of people walking around in sentosa again plenty of room to walk around in the shark exhibit was very cool\",\"we booked a tour through our travel agency and it appears to me that everyone that goes to sentosa in a group follows their group all day the sea aquarium just so happen to be on our schedule for the day i was super excited it was actually a lot of fun and probably one of he best things to do at sentosa the aquarium itself walk through is about an hour deff longer if you have children as anything would be it is incredibly crowded and families literally push you out of the way to get their kids the best spot which is pretty annoying but if you can grasp a breath of patience the views are incredible i have only ever seen a walk through shark tank at the mall of america so it was really exciting to see again there is beautifully jelly fish tanks and dolphins it is so much fun the end display is a massive tank that is bigger than a theater stage highly recommend the visit the views right outside are incredible too\",\"beautiful aquarium full of various sea creatures to admire the main attraction is the large wall aquarium with sharks stingrays groupers and various fishes its an amazing location to go when you are in sentosa the kids will enjoy the interactive tank where you can touch the starfishes\",\"enjoyable morning walking through the aquarium we were the first few in lines and i think it is best to come early the aquarium is a decent size but packed with informations entrance fee is  per person but you can find cheaper deal online i got ours for  per pax we spent about  hours here and ended our visit perfectly because there was a feeding time at  pm\",\"this is a wonderful attraction for people of all ages the aquarium is designed in a wave like fashion so that you walk in one direction and can visit all of the exhibits without having to stray from the main path this is great for children strollers and adults with ocd and or add i loved seeing the different oceanic environments and also all of the educational booths setup to teach kids about ocean conservation there were so many interesting ocean critters to see here and the tanks looked well maintained my favorite exhibits were the jellyfish and pufferfish exhibits i have never seen so many puffers cohabiting in the same waters in peace so that was exciting most aquariums have   puffers max but this one has dozens of them in various tanks\",\"really enjoyed all the exhibits here they have a lot of different tropical fish they also have a nice day exhibit i loved the different designs they have they also have a section where you can pay extra for a ride that puts you into the same situation sailors on the silk road would be in really engaging experience there are plenty of different ecosystems here for you to check out and it is a pretty big place so i suggest you give yourself at least  minutes to walk around and learn about the place\",\"you will not find a finer aquarium anywhere on either the western or eastern hemisphere if you want your jaw to be dropped for several hours seriously check this place out\",\"favorites aspects there is a touch pool where you can reach your hand into the water and touch a starfish and sea cucumber the sea cucumber was so soft i was almost delirious in a good way they have a good variety of fish and sea animals i thoroughly enjoyed reading the posters to learn a little more about each species they have a giant octopus and dolphins i also really enjoyed the jellyfish section really beautiful creatures family friendly activity this is one of those tourist activities that the whole family can enjoy\",\"when we visited sentosa we got a special package visit which included the aquarium and universal studios to be honest we were more interested in the aquarium and it is certainly worth a visit in fact there were two sections a museum piece that chronicled the martime silk road that took you to the various stops along the route and then the aquarium itself which is actually pretty large they do have another theme park on top adventure cove which means that you may not get to see the dolphins when you pass the dolpin tank however there are plenty actually heaps of other fish to marvel at including a couple of huge tanks which you walk under and a third one that takes up an entire wall of an ampitheatre pretty impressive if you like fish\",\"it is nice that is all i have to really say about here it is also overcrowded but i went on a weekend i do not even know why i bothered little children everywhere squeezing in front of everybody to stick their face onto the glass sigh then you have got everyone else taking selfies in front of them it is so hectic never ever pay the full  dollars adult price i would not have gone if i had to fork out that much you can definitely get it cheaper from other websites online like klook or buy a package deal for the other activities on the island i managed to get mine for  when you first enter in the aquarium it is a little confusing where to go there is a projector in front of you showing a video and then to the left of them is the counter to show your ticket and get in you are taken through an exhibition on geography then you get to the first floor with a giant noah is ark and some recycled art after that it is on to the fishes and sea creatures i think i have just been to many stellar aquariums that this one seemed to lack variety many of the exhibits just seem very similar a lot of fish in one tank however the giant tank was quite different and it was nice seeing an octopus that was actually active around it is tank usually most just hide in a corner that i have seen\",\"while in singapore i was invited to explore this amazing s e a aquarium at resort world sentosa i have been to many aquariums in the past and s e a aquarium is one of the best in term of beautiful displays and home to more than   marine animals of over  species upon entering there is an enormous chinese type treasure ship floating in mid air on the front of the ship is a video display and shows a video regarding sea expedition the first tank display is a giant shipwreck next a shark sea tunnel with full of various shark species endangered species such as the scalloped hammerhead shark silvertip shark and the sandbar shark sandbar shark is one of the largest coastal sharks in the world after that just follow the line to all the other tanks and fishes until you reach the open ocean display in the open ocean habitat countless of rays sharks and other fishes attract viewers through a giant glass wall this is my favorite due to the size of tank with probably the largest window in the world and it is breathtaking overall i really enjoy my time in s e a aquarium it is a great outing for families with children\",\"this is a wonderful aquarium and that is from someone who loves aquariums the large and varies exhibits focus on lots of different habitats perhaps the most varied that i have seen they do a nice job of focusing on somewhat local asia and south asia geographies and it is quite interesting to see the change in marine life as you make your way across the region without leaving sentosa it was also a really fun place for kids i went with my wife my sister and my  month old niece and we just had a blast many of the tanks are low to the ground to allow the little ones to press the faces up to the glass to see the cool creatures inside my niece just loved watching the multicolored fish go by and in particular the sea jellies float around en masse the exhibits with higher viewing points also mostly had wide ledges so that kids could sit or stand on them to get a view even though it was a bit crowded it was wide enough to push a stroller comfortably in most places definitely worth a stop while wandering resorts world\",\"i loved this aquarium i had so much fun here the large tani was bigger than the medium sized office building i work in we went on a friday and it was still quite busy\",\"definitely the best buffet place in town i been here twice and both dint disappoint they change the menu for variety but the taste was top notch i had biryani with couple of spicy curries pappadams and a potato pancake which was great from their malay menu i tried sayur lodeh sambal ikan bilis kicap and couple more dishes together with mutton and beef satay they were amazing their roti jala with curry impressed me i also had their fried rice which was flavorful despite their lack of color oh and the star dish of the night definitely the laksa you could put just any ingredients up to your liking and that huge dollop of sambal definitely sealed the deal i am in food heaven\",\"yes this is a hotel restaurant so prices come with the territory but it is a solid and dependable one particularly if you need to conduct a business meeting over a meal with international audience or if you are a visitor yourself and are looking for a safe accessible introduction into regional cuisine there is a large comprehensive buffet at traditional meal times all day long but you can also order a la carte which i did on a recent late night the carrot cake for example is not the western dessert but is instead a local specialty that is similar to the turnip cake lo bak go that you will see in cantonese dim sum houses it packed in lots of comforting carbs alongside some protein radish turnip egg shrimp chilli paste in such a complementary way that i did not realize where the shrimp ended and where the radish and turnips began service is polished as is expected of such a sophisticated setting a great way to catch up with colleagues or friends in a professional environment\",\"the variety freshness overall quality availability of local cuisines the atmospheric setup and ambiance are really fine unique and great for bigger gatherings and special occasions the price is high and therefore makes this a place that is more suitable for business outings or one time visits for the general public i think it is true that you can easily find the individual types of food served here at all corners of singapore but the fact that you can simply walk around and pick and choose what you would like to eat and enjoy the most helps increase the joy of coming to this place the general service is very average at best and possibly slow as often dirty dishes pile up or you have to wait and look for someone to help you with refreshment refills\",\"hmmm another establishment in town that i am indeed torn about for the finale dinner to say farewell to my good friend who is also a fellow yelper trip to singapore i made a reservation here for our last hurrah dinner yes there are plenty to choose from and eat majority of the food that were featured that evening are the items you can find at our local hawker centre but in a atas setting aka air conditioned and more comfortable setting without sweating or in this case without me glowing in my own glow our reservation was on a tuesday evening at  hrs once wearrived at that time we are ushered to our table once seated we went through the different food station to see what straits kitchen has to offer that evening highlights for the dinner buffet were these following items satay freshly charcoal grilled to order petai sambal prawns spicyok items were the rendang and some of the condiments the popiah are made to order though i cannot deny the dressing of the tamarind spread inside the popiah was way too much for my liking and not much of oomph aka no wow factor sigh disappointed items were sotong sambal fish and ginger crabsdo not get me wrong most of the seafood items are either lukewarm or overcooked especially in this instance the sotong and sambal fish maybe its a tuesday evening so did not get the chance to eat or have the chilli crab instead they offer the ginger crabs thank god for the desserts else i would not be a happy camper all in all its hits and misses dinner buffet here maybe i went on their off day perhaps will return say in  years time that would be the earliest else i will wait for another  years time unless straits kitchen can convinced me otherwise there are many more items to eat but since i am stuffed that evening or perhaps so the after taste of slight disappointment we decide to end our dinner with the desserts by about  hrs ish one of the server just gave us a complimentary chocolate cake without even telling us what was it or anything from the conversations i had when i made the reservation i knew what it was from the reservation staffs but that evening it was a let down service from this server double sigh the service was ok throughout our dinner service i expect more from a high caliber hotel or establishment per say in this case grand hyatt since straits kitchen received its halal certification by muis that alone received  stars in my books to end this is one of the establishment that one of my favorite chefs the late chef anthony bourdain went to chef you are dearly missed\",\"had lunch here today absolutely wonderful with authentic singaporean food wide variety good service and beautiful atmosphere over ate as usual\",\"straitskitchen in the grand hyatt is worth the stopover if you are in the area bourdain gave this place his approval and so do i it is a fantastic way to try all the local cuisines in one place without having to order  different dishes it is a buffet so you can sample a little of everything from local malay chinese and indian cuisines the malay station had otah otah freshly grilled in banana leaves stingray smothered in sambal beef rendeng chicken lamb mutton satay and that peanut sauce is to die for down by the desserts the station continues with made to order rojak and popiah i only wish they had the famous singaporean chili crab or salted egg crab the chinese station had peppered crab winter melon soup and various stir fried dishes the noodle station had every kind of singaporean noodle you can think of prawn mee laksa fish ball noodle soup and so many other options the bbq station had roasted duck steamed chicken and soy sauce chicken chicken rice straight from the rice cooker too all the condiments for your liking to boot the indian station had roti naan and tons of saucy dishes to go with your carbs the dessert selection is wide ranging from sweet soups tang shui to baked and steamed kuehs to mango puddings and grass jellies and tropical ice cream service was excellent they servers wi refill your water as soon as you take a sip and remove your plate when you get up when they see crab on your place they will place a bowl of warm water and lemon for rinsing i only wish i had a bigger stomach so i can try everything they were all so good definitely recommend if your time in sg is limited but you are a fatty and wanna try everything like me as of october  it came out to  a person for dinner\",\"to be clear this place is very good lol i mean you are inside the grand hyatt where all things are fancy and immaculate the most impressive lobby with grand entrances and flower arrangements so you would expect the restaurants to be up to the par and have to say the are we ate at both straitskitchen and scott straitskitchen dinner buffet was very tasty there were many food stations just from memory chinese malaysian indian greek japanese and i think there was a few more there was even a juice station with  different fresh squeezed juice options there were also several dessert stations too one for traditional treats then icecream then deep fry shaved ice we came during ramadan so the restaurant told us that meant there will be additional dishes of food but the cost will be bit more around  per person so i am giving it  stars because everything about the restaurant is specular really enjoyed it but it was just a bit pricey would recommend if have short amount of time and want to sample all the different cultural cuisine this is good or celebrating an occasion because it has just great atmosphere\",\"scotts wonderful tea time spread and pretty attentive staff but do not expect the staff to be able to explain the food ingredients but they are well informed about the the  tier dessert tray that comes to you somewhere in the middle of your tea best of all they had the good sense to have a separate section for those of us who simply want to read and catch up on the news mezza excellent food but the service staff were too casual and chatty martini bar at mezza wonderful people staff and guests often short handed on staff but the exquisite ambiance more than makes up for this straitskitchen for a five star restaurant the staff was a disappointment and the food was good not wonderful what i love best of hyatt here and around the world apart from the wonderful architecture lavish floors and flowers is that the staff are well groomed and the fabric of their uniforms show they are respected by management and of course you get a lot of good food and leave with a sense of well being for all these reasons hyatt is the best  star hotel in singapore based on what i have experienced as a diner\",\"not cheap by any means but my favorite restaurant in singapore super fresh and authentic cuisine from around southeast asia great service too\",\"every year i make a reservation at the hyatt straitskitchen in order to sample a huge selection of food that singapore has to offer in a short space of time yummiest foods laksa we had  bowls of this need i say more rojak chicken rice lackluster popiah always a huge line but a little disappointing ice kachang desserts not very satisfying we noticed that while there were huge crowds when we went i am guessing because hotel is in a prime location they lacked servers and a few staff had to run back and forth between multiple food stands to serve food that was prepared in a rushed manner i think this will be the last time we dine there the quality of food seems to have gone downhill over the years our palates were not happy enough to justify the prices they charge but straitskitchen for the years you filled our bellies with local goodies we are eternally grateful\",\"straitsrestaurant is the grand hyatt is all you can eat singapore style buffet made famous by anthony bourdain is layover singapore episode had dinner there tonight and the set up looks pretty much like it did on that program cost to eat here is about us per person after that it is eat as much food as your stomach will hold here is where the dilemma starts after you are seated what to do the staff will give you a tour and the set up is like any you see in vegas but difference the food quality is pretty amazing it broken down into at least five different eating stations there is the  indian station where you will have about three or  kinds of naan plain naan and garlic naan saffron basmati rice plenty of curry dishes from fish chicken and lamb curry then there are tandooris kebabs and then there is prawn tandoori after that you have the  chinese station that serves chicken rice with all the condiments including cilantro ginger sauce chopped red or green peppers etc roast duck and pork wok dishes including chili black pepper crab fried rice steamed fish singapore style chow mein and other stuff along with key toppings there is all sorts of soup noodles here including laksa hot and sour noodle soup shredded chicken noodle soup etc the there is the  malay section with satay grilled chicken beef lamb on a stick with a peanut dipping sauce super strong and flavorful red onions and hot sauce bbq otak otak and sambal fish sayor lodeh mixed veggies with coconut gravy cucur sayor vegetable fritters and some other itemsthen there is the  beverage area where you can make an english coffee espresso or any kind of a coffee various drinks from mango to cucumber juice to cool sweet chinese herbal tea my favorite was rose milk something entirely unique and very tasty lastly  there is the dessert section which has all sorts of goodies including gelatos including durian yummmy and sorbets various indian and malay sweets like barfi assorted nonya kueh warm sweet dessert soups like pulut hitam and coconut cream sweet potato paste and ginko nuts and yet even other sweet things it is been five hours since i was there and my stomach is still expanding my advice to anyone who eats here do not be overly ambitious because it is too much food even if you take just a bite or two of each dish other advice is that you do not drink alcohol you cannot afford the space in your stomach for it more advice have a alka seltzer afterwards still more advice do not lie on your back for at least  hours or you will get nauseous while this place is an excellent way to crash course in singapore it is simply too much the service from the servers to the food servers is pretty much nd to none and the quality is pretty decent you will find better if you explore singapore but you wo not be disappointed the dining atmosphere is a tad claustrophobic for an upscale hotel like the grand hyatt i did not feel comfortable being placed too closely to other parties whose conversations intersected mine i also did not like the lack of vegetables yes there was a salad bar but the food there was invaded by a few invasive fruit flies major atmosphere killer and very low scale despite my qualms i am partly to blame for overeating definitely worth a try if you only have a few days and are just passing by singapore like i am otherwise you have a week to search throughout and find the best quality out there\",\"straitskitchen is located inside the grand hyatt hotel on scotts road it is actually buffet style but this is more vegas quality than hometown buffet quality everything they serve here is top notch and inline with everything else at this  star hotel breakfast is free when you stay here on my first morning i was like a fat kid at a candy store i was blown away with the amount of food selection and the quality of the choices each and every station had someone stationed there either cooking or ensuring that all the food is elegantly presented and well stocked the host does a great job of remembering my name and always thanked me for my patronage there is a fresh omelette station where the cook will make you a custom omelette a porridge station with all the fixins the way mama used to make it dim sum with wonton soup and fresh veggies an indian food area delicious fancy pastries oatmeal cereal belgian waffles with real maple syrup and nutella fresh fruits juice and a coffee machine if you prefer ask the guy behind the counter to make you a tea malik or coffee malik both very good for dinner they also have some great singaporean choices such as satay with their meats grilled over a real wooden flame prawns crab salad rice cakes char kway teow and many dessert choices it is pretty difficult to not find something here for everyone as they feature cuisines from all parts of asia pretty pricey at  sgp but when it is hot outside and you do not feel like leaving the comforts of the hotel and enjoy the fantastic service provided by the staff and cannot get enough of the beautiful decor of this restaurant then this place is a no brainer\",\"i stayed at the hyatt for a few nights and while my time was limited i was trying to find somewhere to be able to try all the variety of cuisines singapore has to offer well as i started to look up places i find out hyatts very own kitchen is highly regarded so im a sucker for trying anything once amazinngggggg the foods were authentic the unlimited black pepper crabs were awesome the waiters bring you a bowl to clean your hands as well i wont say much more except if your time is short and you want a little taste of everything this is the spot\",\"had a reservation here one sunday in june hosted a friend who lived in my condo building back in atlanta i wanted my friend to try out the different variety of local food personally i feel there was no better place to try so many local items in a comfortable environment than at straits kitchen grand hyatt lunch includes a free flow of   types of juices there were many stations each serving different ethnic food there were like indian chinese malay sections there was a huge station that had many desserts displayed when we could help ourselves food quality was definitely good here and of cos very fresh the chefs cooks cooked the food right there and served them straight to the stations my friend has a small appetite so my brother and i would take a little of everything for her to try i could not remember how much was the lunch buffet since my mom was the one paying for all five of us just know weekend buffet lunch includes free flow of juices while buffet dinner does not the restaurant is entrance was kind of in a chaos when the staff started letting patrons with reservations to enter for lunch i believe that chaos could be eliminated with better procedure of how to get over a dozen of people to enter the restaurant at about the same time overall a very good place to try out almost all the local singapore food in just one place\",\"everything is halal halal halal first hotel manger mike took excellent care of us highly recommend staying here food buffet we did all  on different days breakfast lunch and dinner make reservations this place gets busy and i can see why prices may seem high but comparable to other hotel buffets the choices are in abundance malaysian singaporean indian indonesian and more try everything it is all good staff excellent this is now my  buffet spot is the world you cannot beat its variety quality service if i could give  stars i would excellent keep it up will be back in a few months\",\"yes yes and more yes we all know hotel restaurants are not usually the greatest but this place was so good i went back multiple times by choice my first experience was buffet breakfast the morning after i arrived since i was staying at the hotel i figured it would be easy the spread was awesome i started with fried rice and dim sum this was my fave it was so good i had to go back for more there were traditional western options such as pancakes waffles with various toppings nutella as well as a chef making made to order omelettes with plenty of topping options another area had fresh fruit and fresh juices lunch was great so many options to choose from my favorites were the indian food and the laksa soup station i would never had laksa so i had no expectations i was pleasantly surprised you have the option to make it as spicy or as mild as you wish the noodles prawn the broth all so delicious do not skip the dessert station the traditional singapore treats were beautifully packaged i indulged without taking a picture but the rainbow coconut delicacy was yummy try to save room for the coconut and lychee sorbet if you like ice cream great food great service you cannot go wrong with straitskitchen\",\"a bit of everything you would want to try in singapore especially if you are from the west variety superb setting air conditioning and ultra clean and warm ambience great tasting food and so colorful nice selection of fruits and desserts too yes it is never cheap but on a short trip if you want to try the best taste of singapore i would opt for this make sure you book way in advance if you do not want to miss out on this tasty treat\",\"great place to get your local food fix in an air conditioned place at a hotel restaurant price you get the same type of environment in an air conditioned food court minus the good plates removal service something you can never get at a food court and the expatriate crowd again cannot get at the food court the food counters serving different type of local food indian chinese malay drinks and desserts the quality is just above average of any food court really nothing special you get nasi lemak chicken rice wonton noodle poppiah ice kachang chendol u get the idea there are other places where you can get better local food but this place ups by having them all in one place\",\"i still think straits kitchen halal restaurant is a good introduction to local food albeit in an upscale and more comfortable setting with service you get to try the various singapore ethnic cuisines in one area peranakan straits chinese chinese malay and indian the indian food is always the favorite as the dishes are well executed the others are also good though not as good as what you can get in some well known hawker stalls the ayam buah keluak was a bit of a disappointment as the buah kelauk paste was mixed into the gravy the fun was in digging out the minced meat nutty paste from the shell though the satay was good though the peanut sauce was on the sweet side chicken would be more tender than the beef or mutton the desserts are also local fares with nonya kuehs ice kachang and chendol as staples the ice cream and sorbets are also tropical fruit based durian and coconut ice cream anyone lychee or mango sorbet i like the horlicks ice cream which is creamy and malty the not so good thing about a local food buffet is that you cannot really try everything as almost all the dishes are very rich with coconut and carb based rice and noodles\",\"offers a wide variety of items for buffet lunch and dinner all from hahal certified open kitchens menu highlights include chinese indian and malay specialties such as laksa butter chicken beef rendang carrot cake hainanese chicken rice and steamed popiah excellent quality and diversity see photos see the reviews from mark d glenn h azira a melissa z who all tell it spot on\",\"i have three words for you singapore chili crab our hotel recommended this spot so off we went late on a sunday night have no fear this spot is open til  am daily the menu is absolutely massive with delicacies from the ocean but we came here for one thing famous chili mud crabs long beach is also known for black pepper crabs too but we wanted to try this national delicacy on our last night the crab is   kilos and came in a vat of chili sauce piping hot we also got some fried buns for dipping on the side we were provided wet naps and a bowl of calamansi water to dip our fingers but luckily were seated by a washing station with soap and paper towels also i visited that station quite a bit our server and other staff were hilarious it was a fun atmosphere eric r asked for jumbo water glasses and that is the competitor is name so he got a hard time in a funny way and it was amusing the staff put a big pitcher of water on a saucer on our table to appease him we also got some tiger beer pints we sat outside because the inside felt cold at the entry way our hotel told us this is a very casual spot and we saw a variety of people dressed from super casual like us who came from the zoo to fancily dressed people one look at the vat of chili crab would explain why you do not want to be dressed up for this experience i saw some folks inside wearing bibs but we just went for it and got splattered the crab cracker tool was very slippery because we could not keep it from getting wet but it was effective eric r never likes working for food he said he prefers not to shell shrimp crack crab or crawfish or even going to korean bbq shabu shabu and hot pot are exceptions apparently but he thought this was definitely worth the effort our noses were running and our hands were messy but our bellies were happy and full this was really fun be aware that while this is a casual place there is a huge menu of abalone and other fancy fishes and set menus priced up to  sgd per person whoa crabs are market price but one order was plenty for two probably just a bit too much for us so we did not get appetizers or sides beyond the fried buns for dipping enjoy\",\"i had really mixed feelings about trying this place because the reviews i read were all over the place i think my hesitation came from the many reviews that mentioned how they leave you an appetizer as if it is complimentary but then charge you for it or that if you use the wet naps on the table you will be charged as well not sure if this is a normal singapore thing as we did not go to any other actual restaurants mostly stuck with the hawker stands or if this is purely a tourist trap but nevertheless we trekked on over to try the famous singapore chili crab it was odd that when we walked up that asked what country we were from they guessed us not sure what that has to do with anything but i did not really like that are they checking to see if we are tourists we read about the appetizer and wet naps we were hungry so we ate the peanut appetizers knowing we would be charged i had brought along my own wet naps a plenty so we did not use theirs we ordered chili crab and  mantou for the two of us that was the perfect amount of food it was a little scary since they do not really have the market price per crab listed and you do not know what size crab they are going to pick you you are hope is in the luck of the draw the flavor of the chili crab was not spicy at all to me the sauce was a little sweet it really was not what i was expecting but overall still pretty good dipping the mantou in the sauce is a must as there is a ton of sauce we literally did not order any other food just the crab  mantous and  drinks our overall total was  the crab itself was  we also got charged  for tidbits aka the seemingly complimentary non complimentary peanut appetizers there was a service charge added and gst not sure what the service charge is for what i also really did not like is that when they brought the check back after they charged the card the guy stood there waiting for us to sign the receipt from what i have read you do not need to add tip in singapore but here there was a tip line and you know we are from the us so we are used to tipping but even though i knew we did not need to tip the guy hovering there made me feel really pressured and i was not sure whether i needed to tip or not so we did and i ended up regretting it afterwards so no you do not need to tip despite their pressure and hovering do not eat the appetizers and bring your own napkins wet naps i am not sure i would come here again i would probably like to try chili crab somewhere else i do wish i would have had a taste of of the black pepper crab though perhaps another time another place\",\"looking for seafood look no further long beach seafood is the original creator of the black pepper crab for a table of four and a baby we went with the  course menu for four for sgd this menu started off with the salted egg prawns this was very tasty that i wanted to eat more of the seasoning as it goes really well with the prawns next up was the canadian dungeoness crab looks black all over because of the black pepper seasoning so yummy and a bit peppery hot the steamed fish came out and it also was quite soft and flavorful if you are not into fish then i would skip this the fujin qin long vegetables was also a dish that was a non stop eating for me the is oup with the veggies was so good too i could eat this forever the silver fish and sprouts rice came up next and we ate a little because we were so full last but not least was the lime lemongrass aloe jelly dessert it was cool to the mouth on a humid night all in all this was a last good dinner for the trip should have came here to begin with so we could eat it again and again\",\"i must admit that the only reason why i wanted to go to singapore was for the food particularly singaporean chili crab because nowhere else can i get this thick flavorful pot of meaty crab my friend who frequents singapore told me we should go here and so we did i decided to wear a white top and shorts because it was pretty hot and humid even in december in sg if you are reading this do not make the same mistake we got there at  pm and there were only  tables that were occupied and the hostess was still deliberating if they had a table for us ummm the place is practically empty she told us she can give us a table but we have to be done by pm wtf you should tell your server and kitchen staff to hurry up then we were not even offered bibs after placing our order we got chili crab fried mantou and tofu we got to cracking the crab and sure enough it landed on my white top and my legs then that is when they gave us bibs too late for that the food is good the mantou was good for soaking up the sauce there are hundreds of seafood restaurants in sg that serve chili crabs go there\",\"i think this place is better than no sign board and jumbo combined the staff are amazing and very attentive the place is huge and if you have a large party as we did you can get a private room most importantly the chili crab is delicious we also had garlic butter crab and my favorite black pepper crab and both of those two are equally delicious bring the family here for dinner it will not disappoint\",\"service is attentive black pepper crab is delicious along with other items ordered this place is consistent and you can be we will assure food is best quality stars deducted as they sneaked an appetizer on the table we thought it was complimentary but to our surprise they left it there as a trick for us to pay for it shame beware everyone if it is on the table but you did not order it return or ask server before touching it if in doubt do not touch at all they also did it with the wet wipes referring to other reviews we did not use the wrapped wet wipes however they went ahead and place two wet wipes on a plate on our table i went ahead and fell for it and used it this was also charged on bill food is already expensive not sure why they have to go out of their way with these little schemes and tricks to add little change on the bill i think that is tacky i will check out a diff seafood place next time i am in town\",\"chili crab is to die for it is amazing i can just take shower in that sauce it was so good and amazing blacked pepper crab was okay i think chili crab was must have if you must choose i also had some beef dish and noodle but i was just so mesmerized by chili crab i almost forgot yes they were as good but chili crab must have chili crab location is closed to a mall like everything else in singapore free parking right by waiters were very friendly and attentive\",\"i came to long beach seafood with my family friends and had a delicious seafood experience in particular the chilli crab was amazing the meat was juicy and the sauce was very flavorful with a strong but not overpowering spicy chilli taste the cereal shrimp was another highlight i loved the crispiness of the shrimp and how they incorporated salty egg yolk the accompanying crunchy cereal would really satisfy people who like fried stuff or intense flavors i also really enjoyed the mini squid i forgot what it was called specifically but the mini squid was lightly fried and had a dark brown sauce over it it again was crunchy and the sauce was slightly salty but had great flavor i also had their veggies and other dishes which were all pretty good the restaurant was big but we still made a reservation to be safe everyone was really nice and greeted us with great smiles if i were back in singapore i would def come back\",\"it is all about fingering the crabs baby you cannot say you have been to singapore if you have not tried their amazing seafood more specifically the iconic singapore chili crab a perfectly steamed from live mud crab samoan crab to hawaii yeeps claws the size of your hand shell cracked then basted in a fresh chili sauce fragrant herbs a touch of sugar and thickened by eggs messy to eat wear your bib or be prepared to toss your shirt but so tasty the warming but not thermonuclear chili flavor draws out the natural sweetness of the crab the meat itself very firm in texture closer to lobster that crab a side of montou deep fried sweet buns the perfect accompaniment to mop up the delicious sauce heck they even provide a bowl and spoon so you do not let any of the delicious sauce go to waste it is filled with the female crab eggs after all do not pass on the black pepper crab invented by long beach seafood outstanding the same mud crab perfectly steamed shells cracked but this time sauted in very finely ground copious quantities of black pepper the dry roasted pepper corns very spicy aromatic with no bitter or acrid flavors it works even better at bringing out the sweetness of the crab outstanding add a few additional fresh seafood dishes to round out the meal the razor clam ordered by the piece steamed in a gentle soy garlic sauce and topped with vermicelli and crispy garlic is exceptional the clams well cleaned and perfectly cooked display and oceanic sweetness and texture of an abalone more than a clam crunchy deep fried prawns cooked from live with freshly fried garlic also amazing the restaurant knows how to tease the sweetness out of the best seafood this prawn dish can be ordered with or without the shell note crab dishes can be done with the traditional mud crab australian crystal crab or alaskan king crab though why mess with tradition market price by the kilo  kg minimum what to drink tiger beer of course service is extremely efficient but always with a smile it is surprising that there are no accidents in the hectic dining room with servers rushing between tables advance booking required at all locations use the website indoor and outdoor seating despite the heat dine outdoors so the food does not cool too quickly although the food sounds humble seafood is rarely inexpensive this dinner for two inclusive of four beers tax and service exceeded  sgd it was worth every penny i truly cannot wait to get back to fingering one of my favorite crabs of all time\",\"crabs let is be real i do not care for seafood but if you brought me back to long beach i will eat almost anything you put in front of me my cousin brought us here for singapore is famous chili crab no joke that dish is legit however this place serves a lot of different carb dishes like the black pepper crab good and the white pepper crab the best imo they had other delicious dishes here but the most memorable were these three crabs you can also request the server to table side remove the shell for you what it is obviously less messy to eat and more enjoyable so if you are on that cra tour then swing by here and try their crabs i am telling you it is been a few months and those crabs are still very memorable for me\",\"fantastic seafood selection i would go straight for the curry crab not a huge fan of shellfish but man the sauce dipped in the soft bread impeccable one of the most delightful food experiences i have had\",\"im giving  stars for the pepper crab and service the other two which was deep fried baby squid was a total letdown together with the dried scallop fried rice the squid was overly sweet sprinkled with sesame seeds it was overly crunchy too felt like i am eating crackers the fried rice was super bland i had to finish most of the food as it cost us  to have  meals and dint wanna go to waste it was horrible food i thought jumbo seafood chili crab was bad we dint order chili crab here and the chili crab at jumbo was more like a ketchup crab than a real chili crab do not get me wrong their black pepper crab was good it was just the other  dishes killed my appetite and my tummy will never come back again oh yeah the crab was small for the price we paid\",\"long beach seafood at dempsey is a great place to sample singapore is variations of the crab dish i had their chance to taste black pepper salted egg and chilli crabs in addition to the crab beehoon although my favorite is the black pepper crab all variations were impeccable food is  stars the service at their dempsey location also deserves  stars the staff was attentive although we did not feel that we were being watched as soon as we needed something the staff appeared to our table the staff also offered to de shell the crabs the decor at the location was upscale the utensils were new and the table cloth clean long beach at dempsey offers a refined singaporean crab experience if you prefer a more casual atmosphere their long beach branch is not as formal while the food is as good\",\"this is my favorite place in singapore to get chilli crab mainly because they make each batch fresh and from scratch and the sauce is always rich satisfying and with a nice balance between sweet spicy sour and savory if you are lucky they will have enormous crabs available which are the absolute best they cost a pretty penny but it is so worth it when you can dunk that giant claw in all the delicious chilli crab sauce the sauce is so good i eat it with everything the crab additional prawns that i order on the side mantou steamed or fried buns i prefer steamed mee goreng if there is a lot leftover i even take it home to toss with pasta the next day they do good seafood overall i have had good experiences with their steamed clams bamboo clams or pacific clams prawns the drunken or steamed ones are my favorite baby squid fried in a sweet black sauce that i love geoduck expensive but yummy they also have some good vegetable sides and i really like the mee goreng especially when you can eat the mee goreng with the remaining chilli crab sauce yum because i do not eat crabs in any other style i consistently come back just for the chilli crabs which are truly the best thing available here i have had chilli crab in many other restaurants and none of them come close to what long beach offers at dempsey i have found that their standards can be a little inconsistent in other outlets but dempsey has always been consistently delicious service is great too you can get plastic gloves and bibs to protect your clothes and hands when handling all that seafood it just makes the entire experience more pleasant and it is also great when you do not go home with chilli crab sauce all over your top\",\"wow the black pepper sauce is unreal get the bread to soak it up the chili sauce is good as well be hands down the black pepper is more flavorful the scottish clams are fantastic too for desert the rose jelly is just sweet enough to not over power you as for the staff fantastic lively funny and accommodating as well as highly attentive a great place for a relaxed low stress dinner experience\",\"food was terrific chilli crab and black pepper crab were delicious totally worth going did not care for the fried squid appetiser tasted like overly deep friend something but nothing like squid everything else was terrific\",\"not worth it the service is bad and the ambience is worse spending  for two people in this setting leaves me uncomfortable the crab is good but not great many people had told me to come here instead of jumbo seafood and i think that was the wrong call certainly would not return\",\"must go your life is not complete without going to long beach seafood when you are in singapore my husband and i were skeptical about going out of the way for this restaurant we were staying at the mandarin oriental in marina bay getting to dempsey hill was a hassle and there are so many other good food options closer to us still a local coworker insisted that we try long beach seafood and thus the journey to great food began public transit was a hassle we took the green line on the mrt train to commonwealth then took the  bus to opp pierce from there we walked across a pedestrian bridge across a lawn up a hill thru a construction zone passed several parking areas and voila we finally arrived somehow we ended up in the back of the restaurant the really nice wait staff ushered us to the front whew instead of testing our luck at picking random things on the menu we went with a pre selected dinner menu the meal for  people cost  sgd which was about  usd razor clams had not been delivered as a result of bad weather so instead they gave us some other clams as substitutes but prepared the same way as the razor clams these were the best clams i have ever had the clams were stuffed with garlic glass noodles and clam meat there was also a light soy sauce that complimented the dish the savory dish was light flavorful and left you wishing for more up next was the leek flower blossom i never had this before but it was so very delicious the leek flower blossom was cooked but still had a nice crunch again it was a very light dish even though it appeared to be stir fried or sauted the main dish was the black pepper crab this was a life changing experience the black pepper sauce was thick flavorful and spicy it complimented the huge chucks of crab meat we dig out of the claws not only did was this finger licking good i almost kicked my plate clean i seriously had to go wash my hands and face after this yummy dish we also had the flat rice noodles with la la king sauce which was a thick gravy sauce with clams and topped with crispy friend wontons the flavor of this dish was very subtle and elegant lastly we had an amazing dessert of pudding with ice cream and a mango sauce no words could possibly describe light and yummy this dish was you will just have to go try it for yourself the wait staff was so very kind and attentive we never had to ask for anything bc they were always a step ahead of us our waiter even called a taxi for us to get back to our hotel the restaurant was also very clean the food restaurant standards in singapore should be commended\",\"wow this was awesome messy spicy crab but so worth it we drank wine but this is definitely a place you want to drink lots of cold beer service was great did not seem like a touristy place at all my only complaint is how expensive it is the crab and all the sides we had were great but i wish it could have been a more reasonable price oh well everything in sg is expensive i would go back\",\"we ordered the pepper crab chilli crab lobster shrimp each one was excellent but the pepper crab was exemplary want to come back to singapore just for that\",\"if you are itching to shop for knick knacks and cheap souvenirs this is the place to be everything you can think of is sold here the stalls outdoors have more interesting items in my opinion but most of them sell the same products so you can walk around and hunt for better deals some shop owners can get quite pushy but you just stand your ground or do not do any eye contact and keep walking you can easily spend hours browsing and it gets very hot in the middle of the day so either go in the morning or late in the afternoon also there is a lively restaurant strip which gets crowded in the evening but it is the right place to be when hunger strikes food looked amazing and the smell gets you salivating\",\"singapore is chinatown was an overwhelming assault on the senses mostly in a good way though for me once was enough i loved seeing all the colorful stalls and the insane amount of eclectic snacks and other food offerings that said it was pretty crowded around post work hours on a thursday as a tourist it was hard to walk past any restaurant without being called at by the hostess and most of the trinkets for sale looked like cheap junk also i learned quickly what durian smells like as it was absolutely everywhere that is a smell i do not want to get too close too ever again i would read that chinatown complex was a great option for dining but we walked into the super stuffy building did one lap and quickly made our exit back to the street i am the first to admit that i am a little high maintenance and this was not going to cut it for me i will just have to take everyone is word that it is a great spot for street food in summary glad i got to see singapore is chinatown definitely wo not need to revisit next time i am in singapore\",\"singapore is chinatown is very much like most of the other chinatown is all across the globe it is a bit contrived for those of us old enough to remember the original chinatown in singapore this one leaves at least me wishing for earlier times i am not saying that this is not a fun enough place to visit but you are not going to find much culture here and you should be prepared for what you will experience there are numerous tourist type shops in this chinatown and even a few people out on the street trying to sell you a custom made suit and stuff like that probably the high point of singapore is chinatown is the outdoor food stalls there you will find a lot of people cooking up a lot of food this is particularly a good place to visit and eat and drink in the evening when the colorful lights are on and people have come out to enjoy the relatively cooler air chinatown is definitely worth the visit just know what to expect\",\"when you want to go to chinatown singapore you have to tell the precise address of the location you want to drop off if you tell the taxis driver to drop you off at chinatown he will have no clue where to drop you because chinatown cover are is big and cross over several cross street most people visit the area at pagoda street and new bridge road from there you can walk to buddha tooth relic temple and to ann siang hill within the china town has  hawker centre i like the maxwells hawker centre chinatown has numerous shopping area it is up to you to search for it it has two hawker who has won the one star michelin definitely do not miss those there a bridge cross over new bridge road link both sections of the chinatown be prepared to walk a lot you can walk from chinatown mrt station to telok ayer mrt station in between you find a lot of great stuff\",\"china town for me used to be a place to shop when i started to coming to singapore on business almost  years ago cultural experience including food foot massage shopping was something i looked forward to price and quality at hawker centre used to be much better price is still good but not as good as i used to be i noticed same stuff was sold slightly cheaper elsewhere in singapore for touristy stuff they could be listing higher to allow price negotiation\",\"pretty cool chinatown with a couple of awesome food centres around including maxwell which is not to far there is a lot of restaurants shops and hostels hotels in the area at night or at least the nights i was there a lot of stalls open up at night and it gets pretty lively lots of things catering to tourists for sure but also some good eats stick around for the food skip all the shops\",\"chinatown is so close to maxwell food centre so it is nice to come here an walk off your food i came here so i can see where they filmed crazy rich asians the place gets crowded around lunch time but it was also raining when i went to it was a bit of a challenge trying to stay dry this is a tourist trap though there is a lot of shops here and also a history center the buildings themselves are pretty historical parking can be a bit hard so take the mrt instead\",\"chinatown in singapore is a must visit there are many things to do here many restaurants and malls two major metro lines intersect in chinatown which makes it easy to get to no matter where you are staying there is also the chinatown hawker as well as the chinatown street food\",\"what a wonderful historic part of singapore if you are ever in singapore you absolutely must come to chinatown to experience the unique flavors and multitude of cuisine options there are also in abundance of souvenirs and camera shops so you can shop to your heart is content chinatown is home to the world is first michelin star rated street stalls so be sure to find some of them in the hawker centers\",\"singapore is chinatown is pretty comprehensive ranging from abundance of souvenir booths to delicious eats to easy accessibility to nice decor there is something for everyone here given its popularity many tourists visit chinatown and it can be overly crowded luckily i went on a sunday morning when there was not much hustle and bustle i visited the famous michelin star rated restaurant hawker chan for chicken and got gelato afterwards at one of the booths easy to get to from chinatown as it is right off the subway station i got a good laugh seeing a sign posted no pda as that annoys children and elders is there really that much pda among couples in chinatown\",\"a place with a mixture of good and bad stores the best places to go for are the hawker centers the other places are meh for tourists like me\",\"fun to visit another chinatown in a big city not in china some interesting historical buildings tourist shops and many many restaurants guess what food is so cheap you can get entrees for  here and a drink to sip for  i had a kimchi fried rice and a lime drink definitely a good part of singapore to visit if you like chinatowns\",\"this area is a lot larger than i thought at first glance i thought it was just the one hawker center and some stalls then it just kept growing the more we walked the bigger it got some parts ranged from really cool to just okay for example i did not care much for the food street you always here about big cities like new york or tokyo because they are cities that never sleep well singapore sleeps and it goes to bed at exactly    pm that is just around the time where i am hungry for my second dinner but by that time most of the food street stalls are closing up even if you get there earlier than that certain stalls stop selling fruit drinks and desserts the cool part of chinatown is that it is more than just the touristy knick knack shops sure you can purchase anything with an owl on it here or some cheap tiger balm but there is also some mini malls and actual clothing stores around the area where you can pick up something more unique than an i heart singapore key chain but by far the coolest thing about this giant chinatown are the hawker centers i could eat there all day everyday lots of people lots of good energy\",\"chinatown is always bustling so much to see eat and buy the main objective for coming here was to find some fresh fruits i was in singapore during the end of november beginning of december so i could not find any durians at the local supermarket near my hotel the next best place was definitely chinatown since durians are not in season i paid  for a mao shan wang  which is reportedly the best it was so delicious and ultra custard like we also bought  bags of mangosteen each bag was around  pounds and it was only  a bag it is also nice to explore and view the historical buildings not only that but it is a walking distance to maxwell hawker center\",\"great area a very large and old chinatown with tons of stores and restaurants smith street is one huge food street featuring hawker or street food a lot of charm and always very busy\",\"one of my favourite parts of singapore its a great area to walk around do some shopping get a nice massage eat and get some clothes made at the moment it is decorated as cny is just around the corner and the streets are buzzing i love going to this area for excellent massage for cheap prices i had a foot reflexology for  mins  we had lovely lunch along the food street and there are tons of food options along that road maxwell hawker centre is also very close by for what i am told is the best chicken rice in town if you need competitive money exchange rates this area is a good option and in the people is shopping centre there are many exchanges with quite competitive and fee free exchange rates i have been to chinatown many times over the years and love it\",\"bumbling around chinatown was truly an eye opening experience architectural eye candy abounds are these buildings for real whoa look at that building with all those people carved into the building is structure my mouth just dropped viewing scanning the entire chinatown district and i kept saying over and over again whoa look at that oooh i smell curry not just any old curry smell it smells awesome fresh hauntingly delicious and does not smell stale there are so many shops grocery stores hawker stands foot reflexology clinics so much to see so many things to do here the best part about chinatown is the fresh fruit sold and the food cooked here is so delectably delicious everything is made fresh and this place is a foodie is shangrila there is no doubt in my mind why anthony bourdain visited chinatown\",\"i loved this part of singapore the street are filled with souvenirs shops as well as food places it also has a historical background to it and tries to show its chinese heritage the streets were full with guirlandes\",\"chinatown garden bridgea large pedestrian walkway bridge across eu tong sen street and new bridge road it connects the people is park complex with the pedestrian mall of pagoda street you can access the chinatown mrt station from either side of this bridge\",\"for tourists you have to drop by here to check out the older part of singapore which the chinese culture plays a role to the development of this country located at the heart of singapore you can take the mrt to either outram station or chinatown station and just walk to your heart is content there are lots of good eating places along the streets catering for both locals and tourists prices especially at the food street can be quite expensive but do check out the long queues as they are usually good alternatively you can visit the nearby maxwell food centre which serves good local food and if you walk a bit further amoy street food centre is another good option this would be one of the first venues i take my foreign friends here usually in the evening exploring the beautiful shop houses getting goodies for their friends back home grabbing some good food and dessert and after that walk to clarke quay which is a stop away or  minutes walk to the bars to enjoy the rest of the evening so if you are a first timer to singapore you have to include visiting chinatown in your itinerary for good food you can check out these places that i frequently visit in this area tiong bahru porridge maxwell food centreamoy street food centremei heong yuen desserttong heng confectionary egg tart is not bad\",\"beers on tap  dinner different beers in their five coolers an entire cooler is dedicated to dark ales they have some very high grade ales like anderson valley is stout aged in bourbon barrels they also have chimay delirium tremens etc\",\"i know you will get the spiel that craft beers have been in singapore for a while but it is not till fairly recently that the quality of the game has reached a critical inflection point there have always been joints serving good beer but here is the thing about beer it is a young fermentation product compared to wine and whiskey without going into a lot of geeky detail this just means that as a commodity it has to be handled fastidiously and served attentively beer loses almost all of its blush in a very short time this means that if you are having old beer or beer that is not been handled properly or served incorrectly you are not experiencing the wondrous experience the brewer envisioned for you all that love attention and expertise literally just evaporated in this regard beer is a lot like cheese once you cut into that wheel it slowly dies and the challenge is to serve it all before all the magic disappears therefore the key to determining the quality of any establishment that serves beer in singapore is proper refrigeration and turnover gbc is reasonably busy and that is a good sign it means you are not likely to be getting beer out of a keg that is been sitting for a while and that those kegs are getting emptied and changed fairly frequently make a point to check the bottled on dates on the bottles most pale ales will lose a lot of their charm six months from the time they are bottled in fact most us brewers will pull their beers off the shelf after six months these beers will still be safe to drink they just wo not taste like they were meant to they will likely be good enough for casual consumption where you are paying passing attention to the beer in your hand while engaged in some other broadly social activity enjoy gbc they have certainly put a lot of effort into making sure you not only have good beer but fresh beer and the responsibility lies with us the consumer to make sure that beer stays fresh by turning it over nuts and bolts convenient location right outside kent ridge mrt and nestled among restaurants bars and bottle shops in savourworld\",\"i am giving it  stars only because it is in a hawker centre but seriously i think it is great that it is in a hawker centre it is no frills you do not need to pay for service charge and the price is not marked up to pay for decorations and shit like that you just order your rare belgian beer or whatever and drink it it is hot and sweaty but what did you expect if you want air con walk  minutes to ann siang hill nearby both office workers from the us europe and  yo uncles from the neighbourhood come here to drink the fish head stall next door is also quite okay\",\"if you are currently in aa please do not read this review it is not meant for you it is for those who enjoy the finer things in life such as craft beer that you have given up for a stupid token jk i admire what you all in aa are doing keep it up just do not read this review okay here goes singaporeans love hawker centres and especially all the cheap but good food that comes with it i love this particular one not because of the food or the unpleasant scents of dead carcasses from the wet market in the basement that floats up everywhere but because of a small little spot nestled on the nd floor hidden from just about everything else called the good beer company owned by daniel but manned by the sweetest uncle that chuckles while holding a conversation and as excitable as a lil child given a disneyland pass with enough knowledge of beer to garner respect from a beer enthusiast this tiny stall carries just about enough craft beers to please a thirsty camel end run on sentence it is cheap it is glorious it is a destination it is a freaking pilgrimage spot for all ye true beer enthusiasts while everyone else is burning and dying in the singapore heat trying to tour the nearby areas of chinatown why not save yourself from the burning hells by coming here for a brew they even provide the right chilled glasses for your poison of choice they have trappistes stouts ales lagers and enough real juice to keep the world a better place they even carry some pansy craft crap for those who cannot hold anything down for a hawker stall this is pretty freaking amazing so why not take part in the awakening not to mention if you are actually hungry ta ta food all around to stop your whining and raw crap in the basement if you brought your stove logic beckons you to make the right choice if you do not get what i am saying you might want to consider amping up your brain power a bit and a strong trappiste might really aid you in the process oh yeah did i mention it is cheap well now i said it see ya around say hi to uncle goh he freaking works hard and is totally fun to be around ps anyone who gives less that  stars well i figured water and tea is what floats your boat p or you are just in aa lol yelp\",\"places like these are so very very precious especially for a new england beer snob living abroad to whom tiger beer a good night does not make i will gladly shell out the extra few bucks for a well crafted beer curated by some folks that truly know their stuff you might have some trouble finding it on the second floor of a somewhat out of the way hawker center but the search is worth the reward just follow the white guys with the curly moustaches they all know the way\",\"there is not that much i can say that has not already been said by others before but i can agree that this place has a really nice beer selection at reasonable prices the service is also friendly and knowledgeable which is a huge plus the environment is perhaps not the most charming but i do like the place and the fact that one can pick up a wise variety of food from any of stalls here just a great place to go for a few excellent craft beers or ciders\",\"lets face it beer alcohol is expensive in singapore trying to find craft beer that does not require you to mortgage a house is even harder to find so this little gem along with two other craft beer places in the same vicinity is a great find each of them have different craft beers so you can try all different kinds i did not see many white people other than ourselves which was fun because we got to share our love of craft beer with people from literally all over the world now hawekers are not the most fancy places to be but who needs fancy the beer was cold real cold it was cheap ish and it was a great place to talk to old friends and meet new ones best way to find this area it is on the smith street side enterence of the chinatown complex second floor\",\"i discovered this place after searching the recommended bars in singapore and i must say that it was not what i expected i spent about ten minutes wandering up and down smith street until i realised that it was a part of the chinatown complex jump another fifteen minutes before i first of all work out the numbering of the stalls and then where it is locate only to discover that it was closed however that was because i came here in the afternoon and it does not open until the evening however i was determined not to ignore a yelp recommendation and come night time i make my way back here to check it out and i must say i was not disappointed first of all it is cheap beer which is saying something in singapore and secondly it is specialty beer which is also something because most of the pubs in singapore have a standard offering okay it is not a bar in a traditional sense since it is a part of a food court but it is worth checking out for the beers that they have on offer\",\"great little spot i discovered with jireh michelle and nik inside the chinatown complex surrounded by food stalls what could be better they have a really great selection and the uncle makes great recommendations he really is the sweetest guy talkative and very friendly i loved the lychee beer i had and i am hoping i can find it in the states they have lots of craft brews from the us ciders for the gluten free crowd and some trappist ales too they provide you with a chilled glass i enjoyed it so much we came back a few nights later for a uye and i brought a large group of friends loved it if only uncle and his cases of beer could be in texas\",\"if you want to find white people at the chinatown food centre this is your place it is tucked in a very obscure corner that took some time to find but was worth it selection is not huge but very good prices are fair of course there is no ambience as you will sit at the hawker tables with no a c but the people watching is fantastic it is a good break from tiger bonus they have plenty of legit glassware\",\"uyes are great opportunities to discover interesting haunts and this is one of those that i got to experience through the last uye that i attended a few weeks ago i am not really a beer drinker and i think i would go for a cider anytime cos they are sweeter and more palatable however at the good beer company i actually found beers that i wouldnt mind downing cos the taste is so un beer like i believe i can actually cheat myself that im not really drinking beer at all one such beer is the melon beer that i tried it is so melon y in its scent you can smell it immediately when the bottle cap is removed the taste of the beer is also rather sweet not for the hardcore beer lovers but i actually enjoyed it too bad we cant visit it again anytime soon due to the renovation of the hawker centre hopefully the selection of beers will still be interesting and extensive when they re open\",\"the good beer company is a hawker stall that sells craft beers and ciders yes you read that right located in the heart of chinatown a guy that refers to himself as beer dude had an ingenious idea of having a specialty beer store inside of a hawker centre so that people can match their hawker food with beer wondering what goes with bar chor mee or claypot rice ask the friendly beer dude i wanted to try their famous lychee beer today but it was sold out boohoo so i requested for something sweet and was recommended the toffee apple cider a refreshing beverage that tastes more like zapple than alcohol with a hint of a toffee aftertaste beer dude went all out with his recommendations he gave me three to pick from and was a pro at describing each of their qualities my friend who did not enjoy sweet alcohol like me ordered a scottish ale with beer dude is recommendation and enjoyed her drink as well everyone should definitely make a trip down here and have a chat with the friendly beer dude and beer uncle and have some of the famous food at chinatown complex while you are at it btw drinks are priced from  to  no gst\",\"quality belgian european and us beers at a hawker centre in singapore who woulda thunk it well daniel did a beer connoisseur daniel decided to open up this little gem and boy i am glad he did it is a unique ambiance in it is own sense sitting around with a few friends on the second floor of a hawker centre sipping on the delicious hoppy and tasty beers i was afraid i had left behind on other continents the beers are relatively affordable around  a bottle cheap by singaporean standards if you are in the area and want a good brew i highly recommend it\",\"this is like a beer heaven that no one knows about if you are tired of all those common commercial beer such as carlsberg or heineken and want to look for some rare beers you should definitely head down to the good beer company some might find its hawker centre setting a bit weird but that is part of its charm and yes you can definitely pair good hawker food with good beer the owners are friendly and will happily tell you which beers go well with what you are eating if you are feeling adventurous just pick those devilish looking ones you wo not be disappointed pro tip head just a few stalls down to grab a big pot of the claypot rice it goes great with beer and friends\",\"who would have thunk that anyone would have the bright idea of bringing specialty craft beers to a neighbourhood hawker center and so the self named beer dude did in a rather quiet part of the hawker center he setup shop intent on bringing the finest brews he can get his hands on across the world if ciders and beers are your thing and you do not want to pay pub prices for them this is a no frills and a damn good way of getting your weekend tipple better than pub grub are our local fare that is around in the complex if you do not want to walk too far for food you can opt to buy some in the neighbouring shops just a few steps away they are good too ask the beer dude for recommendations nothing in his fridge has never been tried before by him they open all days of the week except sundays they open till late on friday and saturdays close up before pm on weekdays\",\"i had stumbled upon chinatown complex and after checking ye olde yelp app to see what is good i noticed my bookmark of the good beer company popped up after walking around aimlessly trying to find stall  i finally do and i am welcomed with a small but well curated fridge of beers and ciders to choose from as everyone mentioned in prior reviews the trusty uncle was present and gave me a ton of information about the beers i asked about it was really hard to choose but i ended up going for jungle beer is tropical wheat and i definitely was not disappointed i had not even heard of jungle beer before so to me it is a nice local alternative to tiger since it is at a hawker next time i want to bring all of my friends all  of them gahhhh i need friends will you be my friend and we will do a beer and hawker food pairing\",\"there is something magical about sitting around a rickety picnic table in a steamy hot singapore hawker market drinking an ice cold oregon beer even if that oregon beer is rogue zing daniel the man behind the good beer company is not just an oregon beer fan he is a fan of all delicious or should i say good beer and he has made it his mission to spread the goodness to a land that considers heineken a rare import tucked away in a corner of the chinatown complex you will find over  types of boutique bottled beer and cider something that is not only unusual to find in a hawker centre but anywhere in singapore california and oregon are heavily represented as are the uk and belgium as you would imagine but i was surprised to see a few from switzerland and the netherlands as well the stand out recommended by daniel of course was hitachino nest white ale from japan that tasted like christmas in a bottle if you are a fan of beer head anywhere in singapore but if you are a fan of good beer you will have to come here immediately\",\"great beer selection good prices but beware to foreigners that have yet to acclimatize to the sg weather if you think its hot outside drinking beers at this hawker center is like drinking a lovely refreshing beer inside your local sauna there is one table that has a fan pointed at it but short of getting that table after two beers dont be entirely surprised if you have a slight buzz the combination of alcohol with the extensive loss of fluids through sweat will make even the most hardcore drinkers have to pace themselves\",\"every time i bring someone to good beer it is like bringing a kid to a candy store i will leave them there for a while and come back to claim them later take your time and marvel at the wide selection of beers tried and tested by daniel if you here for a meal and cannot decide what to have tell daniel what you are having for dinner and he will do his best to recommend something that goes along throwing a party and wanna pick up some unique craft beers no a problem here as as student the main attraction here has got to be the affordable prices thirsty easties are in luck because they are gonna open a retail outlet in the katong area some time this month so do look out for that\",\"i cannot get over how amazeballs a bit of mei guo slang this place is they even have american microbrews like rogue this beats the pants off drinking tiger and dealing with the immediate hangover the fact that it is in the middle of the smith st complex and that they can help you decide what food to get with your beer kicks it up a whole other notch carrot cake or xiao long bao life is full of tough decisions they even have the proper glassware to serve your beer why deal with the pretense of clarke quay when you can just get down to the business of drinking delicious beer you can still walk to cq if you want to afterwards i really hope you guys are successful and will be back again next christmas good luck sirs\",\"fabulous dim sum as always my favorite was the black truffle shumai and the xo stir fried turnip cake very reasonable price for such a classy establishment hope to come back soon next time i am in singapore\",\"semi upscale dim sum cantonese place in ion overall good dim sum chinese dishes personal favorites are the carrot cake stir fried perfectly for the right balance of crispiness chewiness with complementary tangy sauce the pork ribs were also very tender and the char siew pao is definitely one of the better ones i have had at cantonese restaurants in sg the standard items like siew mai etc were standard good what you would expect from this type of chinese restaurantnice ambience and convenient location good for family gatherings a bit expensive and should make reservation\",\"service is great the food was yummy had dumplings soup and pork all good\",\"it is official taste paradise is my favorite dim sum place in the world this is no exaggeration been to this taste paradise for many years never a time the food was bad or experience a service lapse today was no exception lunch delicious satisfying happy me food   i ordered the following nah i did not finish eating all the staff packed whatever i could not finished for me to take away   for every one of the dim sum dishes i ordered  classic xo carrot cake a must order nobody does carrot cake like taste paradise i had tried similar elsewhere but there is no comparison  baked honey bbq pork pastry this pastry was another item here that was the best compared to many other establishments which offered the same the crust was buttery and flaky in a good way i only despise flaky when it is associated to humans the filling was generous with savory honey bbq pork  char siew bun or stream bbq pork bun the buns were so fluffy  the fillings which were honey bbq pork were savory and so good  steam cheong fun with honey bbq pork fillings rice flour rolls which were thin and soft this is how it should be it was light healthy and tasted good  deep fried prawn dumplings with salad cream generous and fresh prawn fillings in every of the dumplings the dumplings skins were so thin and crispy d ambience  no tacky dcor but elegant beautiful surrounding comfy plushy chairs nice table settings and lots of seatings service  jorrine the hostess at the door had been working here for years i recognized her always friendly and hospitable she led me to one of the room inside the server shaun took very good care of me the moment i sat down he was very pleasant well mannered and attentive taste paradise has never let me down this is the best restaurant i would recommend anyone who visits singapore when they want some top class dim sum chinese food accompanied with  star service and ambience this is truly a well deserving  stars establishment in singapore and ranked the top among all the  stars restaurants i rated\",\"made a reservation for dinner a couple weeks ahead via phone and was promptly welcomed upon arrival eating cantonese food in singapore by a singaporean chain was questionable at first the experience was world class meal started off with pickled vegetables which were tasty and flavorful opted for the peking duck wasabi prawns and foie gras appetizer which was just heavenly peking duck was perfectly crispy and the wasabi prawns was flavored to perfection the foie gras was decent entrees included the salted egg prawns which consisted of a dozen or so juicy and flavorful prawns lightly fried and then dipped in salted egg yolk yum the us beef with gai lan was also excellent it was rather odd having us beef in singapore trust me on this one next came the kurobata pork with mushrooms which was also heavenly super tender pork in a world class gravy ended off the meal with lobster with xo sauce noodles and their famous mango pomelo sago lobster was delicious and their xo sauce was on point service throughout the meal was decent seems like we were serviced by a new hire  sgd head after tax and service for dinner\",\"i wanted to visit this place because of the soup dumplings i came here on a sunday lunch time and they still had dimsum ordered three items baked bbq pork bun soup dumplings and shark fin soup i liked the pork bun and soup dumplings the pork bun dough was crisp on the outside and the meat inside had a lot of flavour the wrapper is thin and strong that holds the soup and meat well that is how you know it is good wrapper it was my first time eating shark fin soup the soup was light and there is a huge dumpling that holds all the meat the shark fins all dispersed when i opened the dumpling all in all it was a good experience\",\"we visited the restaurant which is located at the ion building for dinner if i would have to classify it this is a fine dining chinese restaurant extensive but well appointed decor throughout clearly stating that you are at a classy restaurant very comfortable sitting nice tablecloth all sets you in a mood to prove that this is a fine dining restaurant it offers a great wine selection which includes practically all first growth bordeaux lafite latour mouton rothschild as well as petrus massetto drc and if i was not mistaken even a cult california screaming eagle we had  rauzan sgla with our dinner and the wine was outstanding after  minutes in the glass excellent service starting with wine and food pairing recommendations considering our choice of wine we got recommendations to go with crispy duck instead of peking duck as crispy duck is less sweet and the recommendation was spot on excellent pairing also the duck was cooked perfectly we also had tofu and green beans each dish is excellent on its own one of my dining companions was raving about his cod with spinach sauce we also had the dessert fresh mango pure with an ice cream which is also beautifully presented on top of cold steaming bowl another high point of the dinner experience once again excellent service prompt attentive helpful and friendly definitely recommended\",\"beautiful place delicious dim sum wonderful service when you are in singapore try this place\",\"weekend dimsum brunch here is usually pretty crowded and require a reservation the dimsum here is delicious the hargao has two shrimps in it and the xo carrot cake is savory and flavorful the xiao long bao doesnt break easily and has lots of soup in it while the liu sha bao oozes when you bite into it the egg tart is also best eaten when served warm the bbq pork is rather pricey but one of the best i have had definitely highly recommended\",\"hands down this is the best dim sum restaurant i have been to anywhere in the world including hong kong which had seen a drop in the quality and service quality the last time i was there the hargow and siewmai is excellent as well as the lobster noodle their soup is also great with excellent flavor\",\"move aside crystal jade taste paradise is the next big thing for chinese food in singapore why i keep coming back despite having to reserve every time i wanna eat here  conveniently located above orchard mrt which is in highest floor of ion mall  not overpriced or overrated  polite servers  have dim sums every sundaymy  most fave dishes  blueberry foie gras braised vermicelli their bestseller in carb dept  hot almond paste soup for dessertlove this place a lot\",\"is this what paradise tastes like because i can definitely get used to this first let is start with their impeccable service the servers here are polite friendly and actively try to engage in conversation they see you as an actual person rather than just another customer constantly checking in to make sure everything is up to standards their interior is very similar to hotel restaurants you find in mainland china with revolving round tables and private vip rooms their food might come out a bit slow but it is worth it given the fantastic quality the shark fin soup is best i have had anywhere clear crisp broth with subdued flavoring that enhances the shark fin rather than overpowering it which is something i have experienced on numerous occasion in the past the spring roll that comes with it also adds another element in the texture department with the flaky crispy shell playing foil to the soft fins their garlic fried and boiled lobster was also delicious offering two interesting takes on the classic lobster dish the fried pieces were not overly greasy and had enough meat to counterbalance the shell the boiled meats however were the real creme de la creme served in a butter garlic sauce each tender piece of meat melted the moment it entered your mouth delivering an explosion of flavor among the other dishes i thought their peking duck was cooked perfectly though the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking their braised pork cubes and steak bits were also pretty good though a bit on the fatty side in terms of drinks there was nothing too standout so i would recommend just sticking to tiger all in all a fantastic dining experience at one of my favorite places in singapore\",\"this is one of my favorite dimsum spots in singapore it is in orchard where all the action is the decor is amazing inside tea kettle is quite peculiar food is amazing from the egg tarts to the pork ribs a must is a liu sha bao or the egg custard bun careful though as it is very hot\",\"i do not give out  stars lightly best dimsum in singapore forget the terrible tim ho wan seriously or the cramped and overrated victor is kitchen wtf this place has dimsum to match hkg has great service and is reasonably priced xo sauce carrot cake is a die die must try and all other usual dimsum fare are of great quality har kow and siu mai are large and full of flavour i am also slightly addicted to the little pickles they give for appetiser just make sure you make a booking on the weekends forget trying to walk in\",\"we had lunch from the dim sum menu as other reviewers had pointed out the dim sum is all round very well prepared we had plenty of items and the hits included carrot cake sheng jian bao soupy pork buns har gow prawn dumpling shumai pork dumplings however one star off for slow service repeated badgering was required and we had to wait unduly long to be brought our menus to have our orders taken and to get our iced water refilled we paid s   for  adults and  child\",\"my friend strongly recommended me the place for dim sum i have been meaning to bring my parents here for weekend is dim sum galore alas they are always fully booked on a lazy sat afternoon i managed to get a table for after  pm they still serve dim sum at that time yay we ordered the usual char siew so which is extremely delicate and crispy it is a must order dish here next came the xo carrot cake which i heard so much about it tastes good and the carrot cake is chunky i think another place which may be better than here or on par is at chinatown is spring court i honestly could not be bothered with taking photos subsequently cuz the food was just too delicieus to ignore we had the braised foie gras in blueberry reduction it is super yummy i would say it is basically foie gras terrine with blueberry jam crackling pork belly could be one of the best served in singapore i could have a whole plate to myself again i think that goes for every single dish that we ordered will come back for moreeeeeeee\",\"i have been here a few times and keep coming back convenient location inside ion reliable dim sum and elegant surroundings make me a repeat customer yes it is a bit pricier than other places but i like the fact that there is quality food proper tablecloths porcelain china and pretty teapots dim sum lunch was  and we left with happy and satisfied bellies for the same price i was at marmalade pantry at the stables where i paid for  subpar dish and  latte helped me decide to not go to mp again ask for a table in the back section the drapes are drawn allowing the sunshine in i sat in the front section of the restaurant this time and it was kinda dark must xo carrot cake exquisitely made here shrimp dumplings avoid bbq pork belly it was something like  for the tiniest portion i have ever seen\",\"have been coming here for the last   years and their egg custard bun is still in my opinion consistently the best great location great ambience the rest of their dim sum is great as well crackling pork belly is heavenly unfortunately everything comes at a price in this case quite literally the pork belly costs something like  for a tiny portion the rest of their dishes are also pricey worth it but you probably cannot afford to come here too often\",\"one of the better ones in the league of siew yok roast pork in singapore i have returned time and again for it alone crispy and crunchy skin with tender flesh and a sliver of fat not too much just enough to be justifiable for those counting calories whilst most rave about dim sum here best dish in my humble opnion is mango prawn not quite the traditional favourite but the best one for me i thought their usual fare was more impressive winter melon soup was served steaming hot in a hollowed out winter melon a little corny but may be the reason it tasted better than others cod was very well cooked and it made my day that my mango sago came with a trailing smokey stream of dry ice for only   i was getting all the fireworks the restaurant is lavishly decorated typical of chinese opulence but with just a touch of modernity it may annoy you that the wait staff continuously stress that you can only stay for min hr  hr before you have to vacate your table but service is prompt and attentive and the quality of food easily makes up for everything else\",\"coming from the us i have never had an amazing dim sum experience such as this one the place is very classy and the attentiveness of the staff is on par with restaurants that cost x as much over in the states the price is a little on the heavy side compared to the local street food but you certainly get what you pay for and comparatively from the us it is the same as regular crappier dim sum establishments if you are looking for some of the best brunch experiences in singapore taste paradise is certainly one of them\",\"loved the ambience service staff they asked if i have any food preference allergies very attentive we had the  omakase dinner and we had a wonderful dining experience with the cocktails concocted for us definitely will look forward to go back again\",\"all the drinks are pricey even with the hh list attached of  drinks what a steal sense the dripping sarcasm haji lane is a must for locals and tourists alike it is known as the heart of boutique shopping in the muslim quarter but after a few shops down everything starts to blend in expensive wooden panelling and chic not really our fashion vibe so we turned to the cool libations and food spots here there were cafes and restaurants open while we window shopped but even more exciting are the second story hidden bars maison ikkoku was the first second story bar we visited in haji lane that day we were the first ones inside around pm and luckily it was happy hour i guess singapore has a different idea of happy hour because drinks were a hefty  i got the passion thymes gin vodka passionfruit thyme lemon while my sis got the moscow mule i loved my sweet drink i got it because of the passionfruit but it is on the sweet side thank goodness for the thyme which balances it out the mule was smoky because of the garnish he torched however it was a refreshing mule just like all other mules they were delicious so say the least but after one i would not want to order another round because that would be almost  for two drinks per person like are you kidding me this is not bayfront or mbs i do not understand affordability would be so much more welcoming especially to tourists however service by our cocktail connoisseur was great he made the drinks in a much more timely manner compared to the guys at bar stories but he was not as warm or talkative it seemed like he knew we would just get one round of drinks and peace out because hell o it is freakin expensive cannot blame me for that i would definitely come back here again for their libations they are not snobby about their drinks and they definitely do not take  minutes to make you a sipper their bar space is beautiful and airy which is hard to achieve given how small the upstairs space really is\",\"very nice cafe coffee shop during the day its small so you might need to wait for a table once seated you order at the counter food was tasty and portions were generous with sufficient options for vegetarians i loved the avocado on toast topped with cherry tomatoes the scrambled eggs were a little too soft for me taste but i am extremely picky about that the flavour seasoning was great coffee was a touch sour but still decent the cakes all looked amazing egg dishes were about   each it seemed reasonable by singapore standards\",\"dude i have been here two times in the past month i tried the signature  course menu on my first visit and it did not disappoint creative dishes and also paired with  different cocktails also as it was a friday during lent the chef was gracious enough to substitute a veggie dish for my main course since i was not eating meat second time around i went for the omakase menu peep the pictures its  courses for under  is there a better deal just relax and enjoy the chef even came over to talk to us about what he prepared nice touch location is awesome cool points for date nights or to impress people from out of town i am coming back as i have a queue of visitors coming through bartenders also excellent and super nice i heart this place\",\"excellent service been wanting to try this place for sometime the lobster udon and lobster linguine were very good the chicken sliders and salmon don were good the bespoke cocktail was freshly made only thing was the place was a bit cramped\",\"as far as surprise dinners go this was a success the surprise was meant for my husband but never having been to fort it was for me too in a way i liked the fact that you drive up the hill fort canning park not really knowing where you end up it is beautiful up there and the pinacoteque de paris is a wonderful example of a heritage building we walked around for what seemed like ages not finding any signs whatsoever and then called the restaurant to ask for guidance as they were not allowed to put up any signs outside just walk into the building and look for black signage the entrance to the restaurant is quite inconspicuous and the place is really small really small looking at the photos i would have imagined some kind of room with space for tables but literally all it is is a large rectangular bar divided by a ceiling to floor crimson curtain the chef at one end of the room in his small sushi kitchen and some hipster lighting exposed filament bulbs a nice touch is the small terrace outside you can use for a smoke or just getting some warmer air where you can also follow the action of the shakespeare in the park show drawing to a close depending on the hour of course the welcome was very friendly and the seating at the bar quite ok despite the chairs not being too comfy we ordered water and were asked when opting for cocktails what our go to drinks usually were as this is a bespoke bar the mixologist would prepare something that should then come close to your favourite drink using homemade infusions and literally mixing it up a bit so he did my husband received a great alternative to his beloved negroni with earl grey infused gin and i loved the new take on my manhattan for dinner we went with the  course omakase which had started right away and i can only say that we enjoyed each course immensely our mixologist matteo also the only staff on duty that evening apart from the chef explained each course to us and also suggested how to eat it e g how to mix the flavours on the plate for a truly delectably experience very fresh ingredients and lovingly prepared portions are however on the small side which is to be expected from a  course meal and we did feel quite hungry still having some food at home later on although this might have had to to with our alcohol intake as well all in all we had a lovely evening and would readily visit fort and matteo again\",\"fort by maison ikkoku located at the serene and idyllic fort canning hill is a new cocktail bar and fusion dining concept helmed by executive chef and head mixologist ethan leslie leong the creative team applied different styles and techniques of cocktail mixing such as distillation infusion spherification dehydration emulsion and smoking to bring you chemical transformation of ingredients and the best of molecular gastronomy to elevate your dining experience the  signature mainstays available in their ala carte menu are the sea the nest and the fort all in all the synergy of the gourmet dishes with ingenious cocktail pairings brings me on a gastronomical journey fit for an epicure in a truly magical setting no less\",\"overdue review from my last trip i came here on a saturday morning with my sisters for breakfast so many cafes have popped up in singapore that i am skeptical half the time but this one really delivered i enjoyed the piccolo latte and french toast with caramelized bananas place has a nice laid back vibe and is not way too crowded on a saturday morning when we went there\",\"when i received my bespoke cocktail i just stopped and stared and stared some more it was just that pretty and then i was not sure i could drink it because what a waste that would be so yes maison ikkoku they make pretty damn good cocktails both literally pretty as well as the figuratively i was really happy with my tweaked old fashioned as well as kiwi something i call it bellissima staff are really friendly and knowledgeable atmosphere is really nice and this is a great place to chill out with your date and people watch\",\"came to the bar about pm on a wednesday night for a nightcap another mixologist bar where the men take pride in their dressing and drinks nothing spectacular a safe bet in terms of cocktails where the mixologists mix according to what you feel like i asked for something fruity and with a thick layer of egg white foam yum i got a fabulous diana v and my companion got a french maid which is essentially coffee and alcohol i would not say this place is stunning but it is quite cosy and nice i would still rather go to the horse is mouth instead\",\"the espresso is really good at this place the cakes although huge and pic worthy is just average imo they are  people size so you will struggle even with  people i dunno i know that cake is a simple dessert but i rather have a smaller dessert that wows me lady m when it comes to dessert maybe it is the motion of the ocean rather than the size of the  star on the espresso though yumz\",\"it is hip because there are naked light bulbs hanging from the central bar it is a great place for first dates yes if you are a teenager or in your early s cos it is cheap  plus for dinner omakase honestly it is not an omakase dinner it demeans and disrespects the word omakase it is not sophisticated service is patchy at best drinks are mediocre and if you are a real foodie have been to a number of decent restaurants you will know what i mean whatever seating you go for the earlier dinner or later service means you eat with everybody else they serve everybody all at once the same course so yeah i was starving by  pm and finally the first dish was served all dishes were what you would expect an  year old unsophisticated culinary student would come up with the dishes mostly japanese inspired were ok at best and some were quite laughable just imagine a run of the mill japanese chain restaurant in singapore and whatever they have on the menu just itemized into very small portions and you get to try about   dishes that is your dinner at fort cocktails are made a la bar stories what do you like sour ok so it is some vodka kiwi yuzu concoction nothing like bar stories unsophisticated wait staff varies none were rude but obviously that is not an acceptable baseline one of the waitresses serving us could not enunciate her words properly and we could hardly understand what she was saying when introducing the dishes obviously wo not return you have been warned\",\"had a great coffee in here liz was managing and can really work the very state of the art expresso machine great atmosphere and very engaged friendly staff as it was slow i got many kind tips about the neighborhood this is a brilliant business model be kind when you can clients will return to that\",\"i have only been here for brunch and coffee and cake on weekends love the brunchy egg dishes and coffee the cake we had was decent but not something to rave about coffee is really good smooth it is always crowded on weekends and with that came the noise which is loud enough to give you a headache service is average to non existent especially when everyone is rushing around when it is full house probably a   stars place  stars for the food and coffee  stars for the service and ambience\",\"yes our favorite brunch co now has a cool and classy restaurant bar sister at pinacotheque de paris on fort canning hill the menu sees a line up of bespoke cocktails alongside pretty plates of mod japanese food and the entire concept is developed by the familiar ethan leslie leong who is both the executive chef and master mixologistmuch thought has gone into the cocktail pairing multi sensory dining experience at fort by mi expect to be surprised by the changing scents textures sounds flavors and techniques showcased in the food and tipples preparation it is a f b lab with the insert chemical process here processes going on right before our eyes some highlights from the a la carte dishes here the sea  is a pretty sashimi platter which layers on hokkaido scallop irish oyster seaweed ikura tobiko and ebiko on a bed of sea salted ice it is gorgeous but the overall flavor was a little too salty for me with all that roe and it got fishy as well the nest  is such a festive plate does not it remind of easter think of this as a western chawanmushi which combines hot melted mozzarella and parmiagiano reggiano with free range chicken eggs not a fan of the smoked hay it smelled like gym socks but i guess that adds to the overall rustic appeal of the fish a mod sushi roll which is quite fiery is the spicy maguro hand roll the fort  pcs  pcs  pcs the heat comes from a special asian chili sauce added to the minced tuna which was a bit mushy but the overall bite was quite shiok to end off the dinner the delicious martell cordon bleu lavender crme brle silky custard infused with the subtle lavender and a buttery caramel cognac end the night perfectly with the snowman a concoction of spice rum with buttered popcorn hazelnut and milk which is another dessert in a cup i am definitely coming back for the super affordable  course omakase for just  pax ethan definitely has many more tricks up his sleeves bespoke cocktails are priced at  and infusion shots at\",\"i have heard plenty from my friends who have been here and they raved so much about the coffee atmosphere and food that i simply had to try it sooner rather then later although it was a saturday evening at around pm there was not much crowd we nabbed a cozy spot next to the door with sofas and our back to the wall panelling it was a pretty interesting place as we had the privilege of looking at the types of people walking in the door my keen eye spotted a socket plug at our table and immediately started charging my phone coffee was excellent while the lady lemon cake that we ordered looks tasty but fell flat to our expectations they have other cake selections on display as well but the selection names did not catch my attention the staff service is highly commendable even though we were seated near the door the cashier took note of our departure and bid us adieu would definitely be back here again tips our seat had  socket plugs so internet phone junkies would love this spot to recharge your phone do not sit outside unless you are sure that the people at the table next to yours are not going to smoke if you prefer a cooler air conditioned experience it is better if you take a seat further into the cafe\",\"set in a trendy area of singapore this place is also clearly mainly aimed at the hipsters perhaps the hipster have already left the area for cooler places but the popularity of maison ikkoku seems to still remain they do coffee cocktails and food the coffee is surprisingly good i was a bit skeptic after looking at them make it as it appeared i got a new employee trying to learn how to make coffee but it the kenyan coffee came out clean and crisp perhaps lucky that i ordered it as an aeropress as it is one of the more forgiving brew methods they offer an extensive food menu where a lot of the items are fairly pricey but everything i have had here has however been very good and the cheese and garlic bagel is both good and good value but it appears to be a seasonal dish so try it now the handcrafted cocktails are also good but a bit pricier than other as good places in singapore a general issue for both coffee and cocktails is the slow service they are very friendly but even when it is almost empty it can take a very long time to even be able to place an order and even longer to get it brought to the table if they would up the service a little bit i would change the rating to a four without a doubt\",\"cafe changed management on st july  they are no longer doing brew coffee too bad as i have been coming here for the brews time to explore others all the best to the new mgt anyway\",\"this place would have received a   star review except the bar was so rude charging me a  drink and forcing me to pay  tip for a bar trick f you chris a who came to visit me from l a and i were catching up when a bartender interrupted my conversation and asked if we wanted to see a trick of course we reluctantly said agreed she then asked for a  put the bill in between two beer bottles and asked us to remove it without tipping the bottles over or she will place the  bill in the tip jar w t f would i come back again i do enjoy the drinks but forcing me to tip ha\",\"this was my favorite cocktail bar however on my last two most recent visits the cocktails are just not up to par they are awesome if ethan himself is mixing them but when left to the other mixologists the drinks just do not step up still love the space and the concept just do not believe in paying their pricing for the quality of the drinks that i am getting the search continues for the next perfectly balanced cocktail in that elusive bar in singapore\",\"nothing can beat handmade croissants with homemade pandan egg custard jam free from the condiment bar we have been going back to this place every time we are in singapore located in quiet neighborhood worth checking the shops around the bakery store\",\"if you are desperate for a good french croissant tiong bahru nails it it is fluffy inside has crisp outer layers that fall apart into flakes when torn apart and your fingers get a little greasy my daughter loved it too i tasted their croissant at their safari location such a cute ambiance and had a few other classic french items there hence the determination to go to the original location this bakery is a stone is throw away from tiong bahru food centre so if you are in the neighborhood do stop by stick to the classics plain croissant latte cannele and save yourself some dough haha from the expensive items on the pastry display case i tried a flawless looking chocolate eclair s   but was a bit disappointed when i bit into it the custard was nice tasting but the outside did not taste fresh things took a downturn when i received my iced earl grey lavender latte because it arrived with just plain  tea bags did i just pay s   for iced tea i asked the lady who brought my tea to confirm this is my order she came back to say this is correct last time i checked a latte comes with milk should i have brought my own also do note that even if you purchase items for take away you still get charged for the  cover charge this place was named best french bakery in singapore i highly doubt it\",\"neither my kouign amann nor my green tea croissant were as up to snuff as snob carb moi expected the expectations were much too high certainly the ones i have had in other places had better buttery lamination with good flavor the ka simply was not buttery or fluffy enough sounds funny that a ka could actually not be buttery enuf and the caramel y bit was amiss not cheap prices just expected more places like b and arcisault and tartine are my benchmark comparisons\",\"let me begin by saying this is a small neighborhood establishment it opens at   am me and my friend decide to get there before the opening because we had an engagement which required us to leave the hotel at   am we showed up at   am and there was already a queue this tells you how good this place is taking a hint from the french patisseries this establishment is quaint and comfortable typical of its european model the individual comes in grabs a danish or a breaded product with a cappuccino and makes their way towards the beginning of a new day i cannot say enough about how good the bread is in this place the almond croissant stole the day it is crispy sweet base contrasted delightfully with it is flaky soft body i almost wish i had purchased two of them the apple my apologies that i did not get the full name of it also had that sweet succulent flavor combined with the flaky bread crust the ham and cheese croissant would have been stupendous except the ham selection left a lot to be desired whenever i am in singapore i will make it my business to show up at this establishment in order to enjoy it is fattening but delightful\",\"i set my expectations too high for a high end bakery named after the hipster neighborhood it is in when i arrived  minutes before closing time i was hit with a nice gust of ac as expected options were limited i expected some sort of discount as many bakeries do near closing time but they did not have after i settled on the mille feuille the older woman behind the counter said it was   the display had said   so i asked her if she charged me the dine in price instead of just answering me she snarkily started explaining that here in singapore they have to pay a thing called gst to their government and this money does not go to them i said yes i have been in singapore for  months already and that was not my question i want to know if you know mine is to go then she said you should know that already then who talks like that to a customer overpaying for your pastry eventually i figured it out and said oh i see that gst is not included in the price although sometimes it already is but speaking of the mille feuille it was such a letdown the cream had barely any flavor and the puff pastry layers were bland too leaning on the salty side the highlight of this dessert was literally the raspberries\",\"really awesome bakery in a young kinda hipster neighborhood of singapore make sure to walk around and check out stores bookshops murals the croissant was heavenly but i think my favorite part was the creams and jams available in little pots i was able to put as much nutella as i wanted on my croissant which made me quite happy def take advantage\",\"amazing place for breakfast nothing short of perfection the latte i ordered was flawless and the salmon spinach quiche was simply delightful i found nothing wrong with this place it was not crowded extremely clean and the staff was engaging during our visit i think a return visit is mandatory\",\"we definitely over carb ed here lol trying everything and being two people but one life no regrets came on a weekend and everyone was there so super hard to get a table we waited a bit the traffic was just flowing with ppl buying pastries and coffee some to go and some to stay we bought a bunch of goodies then ate it then more goodies\",\"alway a lime at this outlet at lunch time good quality sandwiches and croissants almond croissant was a little heavy some sweet thing stuffed inside that makes it a bit jelat coffee is strong friendly service systematic way of dealing with the crowd from the notice board i found that they have another  gluten free cafe called the butcher is wife which is about  minutes from this cafe\",\"this is a really nice little bakery they have many pastry selections as well as coffee to choose from the cinnamon chocolate swirl that i ordered was nice and flaky and tasted good although the mocha that i had ordered was okay\",\"great bakery with air conditioning and nice indoor seating enjoyed a kouign amman and cappuccino here and a great start to the day\",\"green tea almond croissant    starsmuch better than i last remember reviewed and probably one of the best croissants i have had in singapore would love for it to be a bit less sweet though\",\"delicious pastry i have tried many different bakeries and out of all the locations this is the best i cannot remember the names of the pastries i ate but i have photos these are the most popular and best selling items in the store crispy outside and so soft inside also their coffee is so good this is not normal coffee just to give you an idea starbucks coffee level  coffee from here is level  coffees are specially brewed by barista to perfection it takes time to receive the order but worth it i also ordered ice chocolate glass bottle drink because i love the bottle not only the bottle looks pretty taste is even better very deep rich taste employee told me these are made and prepared daily very good but expensive compare to other items next time i should try their fresh juice\",\"famous bakery chain in singapore known for its croissant the croissant is the heavy dense kind as opposed to the soft airy flaky one the croissant is rich and guiltily good the other signature item i would recommend is the krouig amman though a tad bit sweet the crispiness of the pastry goes very well with the sugary filling which seeps through each layer of the pastry other dessert items are so so one comment is the quality is a bit inconsistent across branches the best one is at the original tiong bahru branch tried it at another outpost but they slightly overbake burnt the croissant\",\"the baked goods and sandwiches are top quality coffee is too but they only have medium roast beans this is asia and they like it medium i preferred dark roast and i would rate this bakery a  star the teh tarik is one of the best that i have had and the first that i have seen with latte art this would be an awesome beverage if they make the tea a bit stronger\",\"yes it is as good as the hype take it from a pastry hating sweet tooth lacking miser even though the almond chocolate croissants are over  they are worth it their flaky outside somehow holds a thick kind of gooey but not cloying center outlined in good rich dark chocolate the paper bag is hefty in your hand when you carry it out felt like a good pound\",\"amazing croissants and beverages croissants were the right amount of sweet and their flavoring pleasant and not overpowering similar could be said of the tea coffee and hot chocolate\",\"very nice bakery just outside the hawker center nice place to cool off from the heat once you have had your hawker center fare i was very impressed with their latte art nice selection of pastries and baked goods too\",\"this was one of my top places i wanted to check out while i was in singapore i thought that tiong bahru bakery was good but not great the options are fairly limited and because their items are pre made and i was told there are no chefs behind the kitchen during working hours then they do not do any substitutions or adjust menu items for example they sell croissants and have boiled eggs in another menu item but they could not sell it to me together i had ordered the quiche lorraine croissant and apple kouign amann to share with my mom the croissant was okay nothing really special the kouign amani and quiche were fantastic very flavorful i also felt in comparison to all of the other places in singapore the service was lacking the waitress was not very attentive she would forget things or ignore us and the tables next to us regardless of those details the kouign amann and quiche earned the four stars\",\"this place was right next yo my hotel lucky me ofcourse i got the croissant yummy they are really soft and chewy not like typical croissants i got the plain one with hot chocolate with soy milk i got these  days back to back i will likely go back for the hot chocolate but i had to say to myself self you cannot eat croissants every day while you are in singapore so today i will go elsewhere the store itself it is moderately sized i really like the door staff there are pleasant\",\"well organized overview of the history of singapore nice use of senses in this museum ticket purchase online or in person educational for kids and adults rated g pg version of the war non residents visitors  admission steep discount for singaporeans\",\"any nations you go for the first time it is respectful to learn about their history and culture a museum like the national museum of singapore would be the best example underneath the glitzy hotels and swanky retails lies a more profound singapore a history that started with the entire nation being tropical agrarian land before the arrival of the westerners it was more man vs wild than crazy rich asians it starts off with the indigenous people aka the malays and their methods of cultivating land then the arrival of chinese mainly from provinces of hainan and other parts of south china who arrived as early as the th century both groups worked along side each other in the jungles later traders from india mostly from tamil arrived museum murals depicted how each of the groups worked side by side later segments in museums depicts the arrival of europeans and especially stamford raffle the founder of modern singapore it focus the control of singapore under the british east india company it was still a colony with current day malaysia known as british malaya until  when it joined malaysia as a soverign nation rest of the museum focused on its succession from malaysia in  and the formation of todays singapore which is the modern metropolis of success\",\"i am a sucker for museums especially national museums representing a country the nms is located in a prestigious english parliamentary type building with large columns sweeping staircases wide corridors and numerous wings bottom floor entry has a singapore history exhibit which talks of the native people early chinese indian malay traders dutch and british colonizers japanese imperialists and eventual separation from malaysia the latter with film clips discussing the hard decision on the separation from malaysia quite poignant artifacts throughout the exhibit including a japanese wwii replica tank second floor has an animation exhibition in the round and also streaming along a winding corridor depicting animals trees flowers etc impressive to kids and adults other exhibits on fashion women is changing roles in singaporean society the benefits of government housing changes between s and s singapore you can easily spend  hours here cost is  singapore dollars per adult\",\"a great place to learn about the history of singapore highly recommend taking the guided tour at  am tixs are  per person sd our docent was a retired pilot who spent  hr  mins taking the group thru the gallery he was excellent and knew his history well and passionate about sharing his knowledge the museum is very modern and pretty several things to see besides singapore is past history also modern growth since the s onward in the upstairs area and an animated d area with a sky fall of flowers and a forest of local animals habitat and flowers i found it to be dark for the animated portion but it was very pretty there is a section which talks about all the colonial occupation of singapore including the japanese occupation during ww and the suffering endured by the singaporeans when we were in japan  yrs ago the museum in japan made their war invasion sound like a patriotic thing and how their citizens suffered and the recovery efforts after they surrendered no mention of their atrocities to the countries they invaded nor regrets or public apologies there is a tiny cafe on the bottom floor if you are in need of rest or nourishment\",\"i believe the national museum of singapore should be the first thing everyone visits during their travels to this beautiful country this museums shows you the history behind this amazing metropolis and all the hardships they have been going through before and after their independence in  this museum will definitely give you a greater understanding and appreciation of how this country works and how they have been so successful during my visit i got to enjoy a special exhibit in world war ii which was very eye opening growing up in mexico and then moving to the united states i only learned what happened in europe and north america during wwii and it was somewhat scary to learned everything the japanese empire did in this side of the world during the same time period i could not believe we were never taught any of this at school thank you national museum of singapore for teaching me something new and opening my eyes to new possibilities and world views\",\"as far as national museums go this appears to need a major overhaul completely skipping the dutch influence on singapore is history is a major faux pas especially considering how singapore wants to be seen as inclusive they apparently had no problem setting up a comprehensive display on the brutal japanese occupation and that was only three years for the admission price the facility leaves a lot to be desired though the effort made is certainly commendable\",\"great museum especially if you want to take advantage of their air conditioning lot is of history and you get to finally learn all the western influences had on singapore and there are exhibits that talks about singapore during world war  and their independence several years later\",\"great place to learn about singapore is history especially the guided tour by a passionate volunteer guide a lot of coverage on life during and post ww lunch options are rather limited and overpriced though\",\"entrance is  for regular adult and  for senior citizens however it is free for all local residents nice way to soak into the history and culture of singapore place is huge and immaculate wanted to see the janice wong exhibit however it was closed for a private function\",\"i was visiting singapore for a few days and as someone who is used to dry heat the singapore humidity is a lot to handle especially midday as such it was important to us to find things to do that would be both interesting and allow us to escape the heat one of the things we did was to check out the national museum as the name suggests this is a museum dedicated to all things singaporean the exhibits detail singapore is history throughout the years and smaller exhibits will go into more detail of certain eras or certain facets throughout the ages e g pop culture fashion plants even if you are not a huge history buff i think that you can definitely find something interesting one of my favorite exhibits was the special story of the forest exhibit created by teamlab it has digital images projected onto the walls maybe not everyone would find it interesting but i happen to be a fan of teamlab is work although all the descriptions are provided in english they did have handouts in  other languages for non english speakers this was useful for my mom as she reads and understands chinese a lot more easily than english overall this is not a bad way to escape the heat for a few hours you will be able to see some interesting things while learning more about the development of singapore as a country\",\"the building is flashy and the interior itself is worth seeing if you are a singaporean pr you can get in for free otherwise it is not too much to pay either i give this place three stars because most of the exhibitions here are from other countries yes granted that people of singapore did come from many other places and they are all immigrants so to speak but there are not many interesting contents in the museum apart from the time when they were colonised by the great britain museum wise it is ok bordering on the must see because what else do you do in singapore after eating laksa and chilli crab right kidding but chinese heritage museum gives you so much more story than this place\",\"the previous time i was in singapore i gave this place a miss namely because i thought that it was basically a natural history museum however as it turned out it had nothing to do with natural history and eveything to do with the city of singapore basically the museum looks at the whole period of the city from the prehistoric eras through colonialism world war ii and the birth of the island republic and the problems that arose therein it is interesting but really only if you are hugely keen on knowing more about the city itself or are bored and looking for something to do as for me i found it interesting but not hugely fantastic\",\"it is always a good thing to learn a thing or two about a new place when traveling we visited the museum to learn more about singapore is past present and future i loved the exhibits and the artistry the museum offers great for the whole family did i mention that there is ac and escalators\",\"a good museum for singapore is history but i went here after going to the asian civilisations museum so it seemed a bit repetitive although cheaper the second floor of the museum is singapore through the decades that portion was a bit fun especially the  s room lots of reminiscing for my mom i guess the culture over in hong kong was not too different during that decade\",\"if you are rich dine at flutes restaurant in the museum if you are middle class eat at food for thought in the museum if you are on a budget makan at food republic across the street if you are poor chow down at koufu food court in the basement of smu cross the street and take an escalator down museums make visitors hungry\",\"absolutely phenomenal the nms is one of the best museums i have every visited beautiful building with terrific architecture both inside and out for the main admission fee of  sgd you get access to several art galleries and two exhibits on singapore history there is also one special exhibit that you need to pay extra for which i opted not to pay extra for the art exhibits are okay full disclosure i only had time to check out two but in my opinion the stars of the show are the history exhibits there is one of the first floor that offers a fairly comprehensive overview of singapore is history starting from pre european contact through the present i felt like i really learned a lot about the different eras in singapore is history and there were plenty of cool artifacts along with mny different oral histories that you could listen to by picking up the receivers places along the walls the past  years of singapore was a smaller exhibit upstairs in a beautiful wing of the building this was split into four parts each in a different room pre war colonial era through s japanese occupation s post war independence s and s and the beginning of the modern era s and s each room gave an interesting snapshot of the era depicted my favorite was the last one covering through the s it was quite elaborate with a giant mosaic screen in the far wall facing two rows of stadium seats that were taken from the original singapore stadium the screen changed every  seconds or so to show a new scene there was also a second smaller room behind the giant screen that was set up like a drive in theatre complete with mock up cars that you could sit in to watch the short film that was playing on repeat brilliant visit this museum if you do not you are really missing out\",\"i think this is a good way to get a little picture of how singapore has evolved over the years there are several galleries that cover sort of one or two decade stretches of time and those are really interesting and presented in very engaging and creative ways the main singapore history gallery has information dating back to about ad and forward to the economic powerhouse that it is become careful to point out that singapore existed before raffles landed and started it plus for the wwii buff in me the downstairs traveling exhibit covers the experience under japanese occupation i wish some of the exhibits had gone in to a bit more detail i am the guy who loves the most minute details about some of this stuff but all in all worth visiting more expensive than the nearby asian civilizations museum but definitely covering very different content\",\"a born and raised singaporean my first trip here was long overdue this is a world class museum of the history of singapore with plenty of interactive audio and video exhibits to tell singapore is story from its roots as a sleepy fishing village to bustling global city state i thoroughly enjoyed my visit and spent   hours here by myself i explored every nook and cranny and there was always something exciting to see one of the highlights of my trip were the glass rotunda which houses teamlab is magic forest interactive exhibit if you are familiar with teamlab you will know they make the most entrancing magical interactive exhibits when you first enter you will be captivated by a large room with magical plants projected on the walls swirling around as ambient background music enveloping you amazing there is also a larger room like that with comfy bean bags that you can lounge in and just soak in the atmosphere i loved it so much i visited twice another highlight was the exhibit life in singapore surviving syonan it documents life under the japanese occupation and was completely fascinating i have heard stories of the occupation but never visited an exhibit showcasing the documents and personal accounts beforehand there is also a cute room with a heartwarming story of how a couple fell in love during those harsh times this exhibit gave me great insight into the japanese occupation and i loved every moment the main exhibit history of singapore is large comprehensive and beautiful it covers singapore is entire history and i believe singaporeans and tourists alike should visit admission for singaporeans and permanent residents is free just flash your ic and it is only   for non residents if you are on a budget skip the special exhibit that is going on right now what is not visible is not invisible because it is not really worth  its the kind of art that is only art because of what the artist writes about it there are two cafes and a restaurant to choose from when you get hungry clean and beautiful bathrooms are everywhere the architecture of the museum is both traditional and modern and will take your breath away overall an amazing museum it makes me proud of my homeland and to be singaporean\",\"good place for a quick rundown on singapore is history ground floor is currently about the late prime minister lee kuan yew who was instrumental in making singapore what it is today the lower floors are about singapore is history how the major ethnic groups chinese malays indians came here and what they did also some colonial history and about the japanese occupation of singapore during the nd world war i found the revere bell see pic interesting i bet most americans do not know that american patriot paul revere is daughter gave this bell made in boston to a church in singapore in\",\"really nice building where we spent some time waiting for our battle box tour learned about the history of singapore which i did not know much about really liked the sculpture or is it a display of all the pots and pans making a huge sphere in the entrance i did not have time to see the rest of the museum but apparently goes into detail for specific eras in history i enjoy historical museums a lot more than art museums so this was good i think entrance was about   but worth it to get outta the rain\",\"if you are going to spend over  sgd on a cocktail do it here the mixologists at native take their job seriously and have a passion for making the most creative cocktails i was very impressed with their style devotion to representing local flavours and above all the taste their menu is eclectic and fun you will find amazing mixtures like soy sauce and coffee oysters and kaya toast a handful of selected drinks sure to please the adventurous palate after a tipple take a walk upstairs to learn about how the magic happens it is the fun day in science class that i missed a well earned evening\",\"native boasts cocktails off the beaten track procured with native produce i enjoyed an oyster cocktail seriously locally sourced oysters from the nearby isle of ubin infused with miso cured egg pepper and coriander shoots i was either going to love or hate my cocktail selection loved it the sparkling saki is a must try too sweet and easy to drink friendly knowledgeable staff make for a great social eve out\",\"i came here while visiting singapore with a friend the ambiance is very cool and trendy the bartenders and staff were excellent so friendly and welcoming they spent time explaining all of the drinks to us and even showing us where they make concoctions and try different things for the menu they may have also snuck us a few different drinks to try sparkling saki is my new favorite all the drinks were tried were excellent delicious and unique i would definitely recommend coming here if you are in singapore\",\"can i give this place  stars native is not just my favorite bar in singapore it is a strong contender for my favorite bar on the planet there are many reasons to love native and i will list most of them below if you want the quick rundown native serves super high quality expertly made delicious cocktails many containing very rare spirits with amazing customer service and all in a cozy and inviting setting here is some more detail the drinks native is drinks are a combination of superior quality and exquisite taste i have been looking all over the planet for sri lankan arrack a slightly sweet liquor that reminds me of a combination of bourbon and rum and not to be confused with arak which is completely different since i visited the island nation last year and not only does native have it but they make one of the best cocktails i have ever had with it the pineapple arrack this drink showcased the near perfection by which native crafts every cocktail i could not get enough of it not to be outdone my wife is cocktail was also amazingly tasty while the prices are a bit above average you wo not feel like you are overpaying by the time you leave and you might feel like you did not pay enough the extras we were not expecting anything more than the drinks that we ordered but the bar included complementary welcome and parting drinks these two drinks showed off their in house distillery and turned the slightly higher than normal drink prices into a great value the service not only were the bartenders personable and knowledgeable but they were obviously very passionate about working at native in addition the owner came out and talked to us for a long time which we really enjoyed at the end of our stay they even took us upstairs and gave us a tour of their distillery all in all this was an experience not just a visit to a bar the location easy to get to very comfortable and inviting and with clean bathrooms if you are in singapore and like cocktails you owe it to yourself to experience native\",\"at first i was turned off as i wanted one of the bartenders to explain the difference between two drinks i was deciding between another staff member explained the difference between the two cocktails to me not a good look as all the staff should be able to discern each drink on the menu what i really liked about this place was that the cocktails were very different craftily concocted organic and represented different parts of the world even the playlist is carefully constructed for this place my intrigue and respect came back for native i enjoyed both of my drinks at this place\",\"second stop on my night of nicer cocktail bar hopping native welcoming and homey with drinks inspired by the bartenders travels yes they go on little trips together and come back with jars of local ingredients to infuse into their cocktails cool right it reminded me a little of the whole nordic farm to table philosophy that i am such a fan of and what do you know some of their bartenders are currently in copenhagen collecting ingredients and learning from the noma chefs amazing fun fact my drink came in a frozen napkin and i thought it would be wasteful to keep a freezer full of frozen napkins but my friend kindly reminded me that liquid nitrogen is a thing oops anyway along with our drinks shown above we were given some sparkling sake much better than hot or cold sake potentially because the flavor is lighter and some gin infused pomegranate stuff and a tour of the cocktail lab where they distill and extract concentrated flavors of the various ingredients that they collect straight up fancy versions of the distillation apparatuses that i have used in organic chemistry lab wild they do not use lemons and limes typically staples of any bar due to waste instead relying on the acidic profiles of other ingredients to give their drinks that same flavor very unique concept and i am a huge fan of their narrative definitely give this place a try tourist or local\",\"tldr this place exceeded all my expectations which was a lot considering its one of the worlds top bars highly recommend due to amazing hospitality i came to check out the place near opening because i was worried it would be busy but luckily i was immediately seated at the bar the place is tiny but not in a bad way maybe it is because i did not have to wait long so it did not bother me it had an intimate setting once seated they hand you a menu and a glass of sparkling sake the sake was refreshing and slightly sweet maybe to cleanse the palate it was great considering how hot and humid it was outside i ordered the strawberry kimchi had a nice kick and they used strawberry granita to keep the drink cool the drink was just okay in my opinion it is kind of pricey but that seems to be the norm in singapore i would have tried more drinks but there were other bars i wanted to stop by as well what really gave this establishment  stars was the customer service maybe because i was by myself but the bartender and host were friendly and easy to talk to i ended up leaving with recommendations for bars in taipei and tokyo too\",\"this place is amazing we walked in late for our reservation and the staff could not be nicer or more welcoming we interacted with all of the staff while we were there and all the drinks were explained in detail we were offered a tour of where they make many of the ingredients for the drinks but we were already late for our next destination i got the sarapan and jovanie got the pinapple arrack both were good though i liked jovanie is better i was even going to order it but thought to try at least two drinks while we were there if you are looking for a beautiful bar with a great staff and delicious drinks that you have never tasted before go here\",\"i really enjoyed myself at native not only were the drinks pleasent the customer service was excellent native brings to the bar scene local and regional influences sourcing and just an all round good vibe their spirits are mostly derived from small regional distilleries mostly in south east asia the seating begun with a free shot of sparkling sake and proceeded to our orders and finally a free whiskey citrus combination to end the night very enjoyable our host spared no details as he shared the philosophy behind native most of what they have are created in house from kombucha to different pastes and other fermentation not to mention they only played local music i had the grasshopper which is a classic twist on the usual grasshopper with a dash of actual fermented grasshopper my friends had the peranakan which came with a kueh and had strong essence of gula melaka and we also tried the oolong highball and pineapple drink overall i really enjoyed the experience i believe the drinks could use a little more strength but i believe the experience at native itself is worth the visit\",\"what a cool bar experience the drinks are so unique because they really pride themselves on sourcing local ingredients and traditional flavor pairings and the bartenders are all incredibly knowledgeable of their liquors where they are from history etc came here with a rather large party while visiting singapore with a family friend who always takes guests here and i can see why we sat at the booth and as members of our party started coming in they provided us with a free starter drink a delicious sparkling sake which was very much appreciated some of the drinks had really interesting profiles like strawberry and kimchi and a grasshopper that used crushed up dried grasshoppers when they served the drinks the bartender would go through each drink to explain the background behind it and the recommended way of enjoying it a few minutes later he would come back with some of the key ingredients and liquors in them and go further into the history and importance of those ingredients it was really cool to experience and provided some key insights into singaporean history overall native has a really cool atmosphere and is unlike any other bar i have visited before you can tell that they really pride themselves on their quality sourcing and sustainability as an establishment the painting along the stairs as you walk up was made using the scraps from the bar the interior is not very large but is very intimate and homey yes the drinks are expensive but it is comparable to other cocktail bars in singapore you get a really authentic experience and delicious drinks when you visit native\",\"what an incredible bar in singapore the drinks are extraordinary very special and the taste is unbelievable there are only a few so innovative bars in the world so if you go to native slow down enjoy the explanation of the team of each drink and maybe you have luck and you will be invited into the lab\",\"very creative and innovative cocktails lots of restaurants and bars are fond of saying we are telling a story this is actually happening at native you can get a nice education of local flavors through these drinks stayed way longer than anticipated deserving of all the accolades\",\"this place is great the vibe the atmosphere workers and most importantly the drinks my only qualm about this bar is the teeny tiny baby portions you would need  drinks to get a buzz huge ice cube and the drink barely has any liquid drinks are around  sgd so be prepared to spend if want to get drunk\",\"amazing upscale cocktail bar with an amazing theme they focus on regional spirits and even go so far as to have all their drink ware hand made and hand painted every drink i tried was unique a pure delight to the senses the drinks are a little on the pricey side but then again what is not in singapore it is worth the price for such a special experience\",\"best bar in singapore one of the best in asia and one of the more unique in the world of their bottle collection they had only about two kinds that were widely distributed really excellent cocktails knowledgeable and fun staff relaxed atmosphere very cool distillery on the third floor if you visit one bar in singapore it should be this one\",\"great ambiance super informed friendly staff that is all before one gets to the drinks wow pictures do not do it justice and they even have a mixing lab upstairs to try out new variations highly recommended\",\"some of most creative thoughtful well executed and downright delicious cocktails i have ever had this place is different very different it is not just another cocktail bar with the usual drinks you will not even find spirits you recognize here the spirits used ingredients and ideas are as original as i have ever seen they have spirits i have never heard of and note i collect and am a spirits enthusiast and the recipes are epic they do not have rail spirits ambiance is nice but the place is new and more folks need to discover it and once this happens trust me it will be as packed as anywhere else bartenders are awesome and super friendly and clearly really skilled go here of you wish to have happiness\",\"absolutely unique bar with completely handcrafted local cocktails you simply will not find anywhere else in the world\",\"this place is groundbreaking and inspiring got to try some really amazing spirits from thailand i cannot wait to go back\",\"while visiting another bar nearby i was recommended to visit this bar and i am happy for this tip while most bars that i visited in singapur are focused on western spirits this one is clearly focused on what they call regional products of course regional in this case means from india up to japan with these products they need to invent their own drinks and that is what i really like here you do not get the same drinks as everywhere else they are also trying to reduce waste and so you wo not get lime or lemon juice too small amount of juice for the big fruits they use different products even ants yes ants are part of recipies to get acid into the cocktail crunchy very nice personnel who even showed me the whole third floor with their own gin production\",\"on the first morning during a business trip to singapore my boss gave me two options for breakfast continental breakfast at our hotel or some indian food was not much of a choice we walked for about  odd minutes from our hotel on orchard to little india soaking in the heat humidity and the greenery admiring the clean streets and the well mannered motorist silently pondering that this looks and feels like india except for much cleaner sigh we descended onto mtr courtesy yelp mtr is a small clean air conditioned restaurant trust me  mins of a morning walk in  humidity you respect air conditioning i ordered the pudi dosa neer dosa and the filter coffee i confess i would not have tried those except filter coffee if it were not for the nudge of my colleague i had never tried those two the pudi dosa came first with the chutney and the sambhar oh man those flavors and the texture it looked like an uttapam the savory pancake with ghee and a concoction of red spice on top not hot but spicy amazing flavors it had been a while that indian food has surprised my palate writing this review triggers the flavor and aroma memories such a delight then came the neer dosa neer means water in the local language as the name suggests its very light and subtle flavors quite the contrast from the previous dish this came paired with coconut sauteed gently with cardamon and sugar it was heavenly for me my colleague on the other hand was slightly less impressed he said he has had better neer dosa i believe him it was amazing for me two chutneys and the sambhar came with one of the dosas not sure what came with what what i can tell you with confidence it that my colleague and i agreed that the coconut chutney was as authentic as it gets and as flavorful as one expects we topped off the food with filter coffee that was probably the least favorite for me it tasted like instant coffee not a huge fan i went back another day for more pudi dosa my new favorite south indian restaurant only  hour flight away from palo alto and  hours from india ps i wish i had clicked pictures\",\"this was a delight to go to in little india very good service and authentic unique menu which is not so common in south indian restaurants i have been using mtr spices and have known this brand since childhood so going to the restaurant was exciting and special the manager graciously let us keep our stroller outside the door and mentioned not to worry about it the server was very helpful and told us to try few specials which we relished i definitely enjoyed their set dosa highly recommend this place if you are looking for south indian meal or just tidbits\",\"great food at good prices i ordered the mini meal pudi idli and buttermilk pudi idli  was my favoritebisibelabath raita rava kesari and avial in mini meal  were outstanding veg pulav was good and curd rice was decent but again i have never been a fan of curd rice so my opinion could be biased buttermilk  was very good too the portion size is generous one dish should suffice\",\"love that i stumbled across this gem on my first day in singapore delicious food kind service reasonable prices credit cards accepted i have been working my way through the menu and everything i have gotten so far has been fantastic always crowded it is that good\",\"firstly the place is clean and i mean clean even by singapore standards in keeping with the high standards set by the original location in bangalore try to go before  am for lunch especially on weekends and before pm in the evenings to order one must get in line at the cashier and pay up front then one gets a stand with the order number which is displayed on ones table menu highlights include the ragi finger millet dosa bisi bele bhaath rice cooked with lentils and veggies puliyogare tamarind rice maddur vada crispy fritters seasoned with onion curry leaves and spices set dosa like pancakes served with coconut veggie curry called avial drinks are decent the lassi is always good to try as is the badam almond milk this visit i had the akki roti roti made from rice flour and seasoned with onion and green chili and button idly soaked in thove kind of a thin daal without the typical spices of sambhar or rasam for dessert i highly recommend the badam halwa which is a deceptively small serving however since it consists of just ground almonds ghee and sugar it packs a massive punch do not underestimate its ability to fill you up only reason i give it  stars is that the spice level is often a tad too high for me else thumbs up including for the prompt and courteous service\",\"love the food not a veggie guy but this place has one of the best dosas in town enjoyed the unique experience\",\"overhyped indian snacks restaurant prata walau serves better dosai at better price too good for tourists though\",\"uddin vada similar to a donut very good fried crispy but inside was softpudi masala dosa has a spongy texture came with potatoes on topmini meal set tastings of five different rice stew sampler\",\"this place was up off the beaten path past little india and my husband and i went way out of our way to go here based on the reviews we ordered dosai dosa dishes and the sooji halwa for dessert the dosai were way too crispy missing the al dente chew you look for in a good dosa especially if you intend to roll it up it requires a flexibility to do so service was meh and the wait was long for a table lots of local indians so clearly they are doing something right though\",\"some amazing south indian food here its a very distinct style though something i have not tasted so far the dosa is thicker than usual but oh so crispy loved the vegetable special dosa unique texture and great taste the rice idli and coffee was amazing too will be back for sure\",\"not only is the indian food absolutely incredible but they were extremely considerate about my dairy allergy here the food came out quickly and the owner double checked to make sure it had no allergens great food great vegan dairy allergy options and nice service plus lots of free drinking water all around great experience\",\"love love love mtr in singapore do not miss the bisibele bath set dosa and filter coffee liked it so much that we had mtr catering and all our guests loved it fully vegetarian menu service is fast and restaurant is centrally located in little india\",\"i was not wanting for vegetarian but was very happy i sought out mtr is little india authentic curries and breads stuffed with all good things such as potato and onion popular with the locals too so you know you are into a good thing do try it if it is veggie curry in a hurry you are after you wo not be disappointed\",\"this was the most authentic indian food ive tasted in singapore the staff were extremely friendly and even seated me at  pm right as they were closing down for a switch to dinner i was really blessed by my experience highly recommended a must try in singapore many thanks pictured below is a famous single uddina vada doughnut accompanied with chutney\",\"poor quality oily food i guess this is the state of all indian restaurants in singapore\",\"the best south indian food in singapore for the price range that is saying a lot since there is a lot of completion for the same kind of food there used to go there often love the dosas button idlis vada filter coffee consistent good food used to eat there then pack food for home highly recommend it\",\"nothing more you can ask for a early morning dosa crispy and spiced just nice came here at exactly  am saturday and was the first customer no issue finding parking which is mostly a drag for eateries around here place is clean service is excellent before  it was packed back again july rd with the in laws and yep this as good and efficient as ever\",\"amazing restaurant very homely food for me as a south indian the food is well cooked and tastes very different and unique compared to other indian restaurants around little india try the pudi dosa a dosa with spicy chutney powder and ghee which is very special to this place service is fast and friendly i will come back again and again and again\",\"we went to mtr for breakfast two days in a row as we loved it food was freshly prepared and tasty the restaurant was very clean and well kept the staff was attentive it does get pretty crowded on weekends as soon as you enter the restaurant you need to place the order at the counter before being seated hence it is better to take a look at the menu which is placed outside the restaurant before entering so that you do not feel rushed i would highly recommend this place for good old indian breakfast\",\"deliciousness exemplified the taste of set dosa took me back to the days of delicious dosas at udupi upahar in kormangala south indian cuisine is hands down the best of all\",\"this is a well hyped speakeasy style cocktail bar located in a subterranean venue that is not super obvious to find google maps gets you pretty close but you have to look for a building marked  ann siang hill and find a black door with a tiny operation dagger sign next to it still it is worth the effort required in finding it while the cocktails are premium priced you are also getting quite a unique sensory experience their menu for example is not the standard listing of drinks and their ingredients instead you will get vague descriptions of the flavor profiles of each drink the bartenders can explain further what ingredients go into them although i was not sober enough to remember what went into mine the cheese no egg for example was described as offering notes of cheddar cream honey and smoke it certainly delivered on the first three parts as the drink was on the surface a chilled almost egg noggy affair served in a small cup but the smoke was what distinguished it the cup containing the actual drink came inside a large glass jar full of nest like material that was set ablaze which created lots of smoke that settled into the drink once the glass jar was closed see the accompanying pictures and videos to get a better sense for what i am talking about the so it was not coffee meanwhile had no hint of coffee whatsoever although it was a strong boozy wake up call that tasted like ginseng but there is no ginseng to it the bartenders explained that it was the interaction of the specific ingredients that created such a strong flavor the space itself is super sexy and is perfect for both intimate affairs and for small groups it is a dimly lit bunker like venue although cocktail purists might not be impressed the novelty of it all made for a very compelling experience\",\"this was a complete  from native in terms of atmosphere but yet again the drinks and staff were amazing we walked through an unmarked door and down a set of stairs to a an open bar area that was very industrial and had a canopy of lightbulbs on the ceiling i think we tried almost every drink on the menu we had to stop before the last two because we had an early morning flight out of singapore my favorite was the hot and cold i also tried the red eye bee pollen corn and oil and black attack i cannot remember if these are the correct names of the last two but again as with native these are drinks i have never tasted before i have barely even heard of the ingredients we always had our water glass filled and people checking on us without us having to flag someone down they had hip hop playing in the background and it was pretty full for a wednesday night i want to visit singapore again just to come back here that is how good these drinks are\",\"what a crazy and quirky bar i loved the decor here especially those light bulbs overhead i had the hot cold drink and my husband had the gomashio while the cocktails are pricey what alcoholic beverage is not pricey in singapore they are absolutely worth the experience while we were here only for a nightcap i could see myself staying here for a long time everyone seemed very friendly the music was great and the drinks were fantastic\",\"wow i was pretty blown away by their cocktails you will literally miss this place if you do not know about it no signboard located in a corner of a building only indication is a glass door and the operation dagger stick figures on top of the door it is down a narrow set of stairs that kinda smells like someon yakked there part of the vibes maybe they have been around for about  years and have this prohibition theme for secret societies and triads of singapore it is a tiny room which could use a little more smart planning but perhaps this is what the space is meant to be we stood and waited for about  mins before a table opened i tried the egg one of their classic signature cocktail served in a tea cup displayed in a glass nest the nest hosts smokey star anises that were flamed and added to the drinks essence i loved the texture of the drink it is like a thick milky emulsion that washes down with its pleasent sweetness at  it is kinda standard for sg hipster mixologist scene i also enjoyed the hot and cold give it a try i will definitely be back to try their other stuff\",\"on the outskirts of traditional and touristy chinatown there is this hipster little street on ann siang hill with a darn good selection of bars and if you know me you know i love a good cocktail it was my first time visiting singapore and after getting rejected from a different cocktail bar for wearing flip flops give me a break i am a tourist and it is real hot outside me and a friend ended up at the mysterious operation dagger so mysterious that the entrance is marked only with their logo that you gotta be in the know to recognize the interior is hipster industrial with mood lighting the atmosphere a little more than cold and aloof and the cocktails divine you better be strolling in in your yeezys and supreme which i was not the menu lists only flavor profiles because reallllly the focus should be on cultivating these profiles rather than thinking about whether you are feeling vodka or tequila an appetizer of cucumber pieces in some white creamy stuff served on a stone plate to cleanse the palette my drink was served in a ceramic tea cup with a white chocolate cup and some frozen yuzu balls inside the cup that you are supposed to eat first then drink original definitely unique and very very smooth prices are not cheap but for the experience i would highly highly recommend\",\"stars creative cocktail bar in ann siang hill one of my favorites in sg very creative drinks and everything is good personally enjoy the hot and cold and gomashio the bartenders are also very helpful they give great recommendations based on your preferences pricey though  for a small drink location wise a bit hard to sign as there is no obvious sign you have to look for a creatively designed o d symbol at the address specified speakeasy atmosphere\",\"had the mocktail version of hot and cold to say it is delicious will be an understatement my first sip of the drink was euphoric the creamy hot white chocolate at the top combined with the cold pineapple at the bottom was heavenly in the mouth coupled with great music dark ambience and rich intellectual conversations you are gonna get an absolutely memorable experience\",\"people laugh when i say my saturday night plans consist of drinking alone at a bar with me myself and i i did not let this hold me back as i did deep research into good solo traveler bars so i could continue on my mission to review all the finest food and drink singapore has to offer originally i tried to go to the much talked about  hong kong street but was turned away because they had a private party and i was not invited womp womp of course i had a fall back operation dagger operation dagger is advertised to be kind of secret but also really well known for their cocktails i would say the interwebs has done a great job capturing the essence of this place because that is also exactly how i would describe it i felt silly walking past the door many a time i had dressed up determined to take myself out on the best date of my life and i walked behind the hustle and bustle of club street down a street that no one seemed interested in i nervously hoped i was going the right way and did not look like a total doofus that got all dressed up with nowhere to go at this point i am torn whether or not i should post photos of what the entrance looks like but i have decided not to because finding this place is part of the experience if you cannot find it there are some pretty obvious hints scribbled on building walls so do not worry too much or just google it i opened the unmarked door and walked down a short dark cement staircase that made me think twice about continuing the trek but i did and it was so worth it in an attempt to avoid the crowds i got to the bar a bit past pm right after it opened i had no trouble finding a seat another solo traveler sat at the bar and two larger parties sat at the tables the menu was full of elaborate seeming cocktails that truly seemed unique at prices that i would never pay in america i had just spent  on a regretful singapore sling so i questioned whether i should drop another  on a unique cocktail i did it was great i got the hot cold which is apparently a mix of pineapple lavender white chocolate and coconut i have to say it was one of the best drinks i have ever had ever the cold is the actual drink which is proabably where the pineapple comes into play the hot is the delicious dessert like foam on top which oozes white chocolate and coconut i drank it all dangerously fast and could easily see myself downing four drinks before dinner that is  for those of you counting at home i did not but i wanted to i wanted to try everything on the menu as i saw people around me getting truly fantastical creative drinks made before them like works of art the staff were so kind and committed to their craft they gave me a few tips on which other bars i should check out and i even got a free ginger beer as i waited for a few friends to show up the only downside of this place is that the drink i had did not taste like alcohol at all so i am honestly not sure if there was any in my drink seriously did i order something off the virgin menu this is definitely a place worth a trip or two or three if i lived in singapore it would be a go to date place for me especially since the music is on point i honestly want to try to omakase and see what else od has up their sleeves i will be back for sure maybe even tomorrow night total cost     usd no  ann siang hill b singaporevisa acceptedthis review was copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews\",\"that is not a knife there is a good reason why you are not sitting in operation broadsword or operation halberd because those would provide a front on assault to the senses operation dagger is a stab you in the back with the x multiplier fiend who will lure you into the dark and then steal off with your gold purse and giggle with glee as he does so i have been in singapore for   years and have only just visited this bar recently having been to the likes of hk shin gi tai debespoke gibson adrift and countless other fantastic cocktail bars od had a lot to measure up to and it was a big glug of the good stuff short on all counts the first impression is dark and dank which would be ok if there was some sort of atmosphere or vibe the lightbulb conglomeration is interesting for about  minutes before you realise that is the entire theme of the place the menu was extremely short and i am told has not changed in forever which was disappointing to say the least because the drinks are underwhelming i had  drinks from the menu and both were so sweet i almost could not finish them no balance no finesse and certainly no demonstration of mixology expertise i also had one off menu just asking the bartender to make something based on a flavour profile whilst this was marginally better it was still a long way from just a standard negroni i could get in just about any bar in singapore the staff were hit and miss we were attended to quickly upon arrival with menus water but then had to wait significantly to get drink making attention when looking for the next drink we had to wait again there was a distinct air of indifference from the staff they were not disinterested they just seemed to be going through the numbers rather than providing that great vibe and banter that you are looking for in a best bar in asia one is a hard score but i could not go two for three clear reasons firstly od comes with a fair bit of hype being listed on the best bars of asia lists all the time and alongside those esteemed entries it just does not stack up secondly i would never return here or recommend it to anyone it is dank and dark and offers little to no atmosphere other speakeasy type bars even sparse ones offer some sort of thematical nuance to draw you in i cannot imagine any scenario where i would find myself coming here to start middle finish a night lastly it is expensive for what you get i e high end singapore prices for low end cocktails served by indifferent staff in a dark hole in the ground\",\"the space is a little cold and bare but the staff and the drinks are great they have a limited menu but this bar is known for creating drinks based on what you feel like drinking just tell the bartender what you like and he she creates a unique drink for you we were presently surprised with how well made our drinks were and the process they took to make them the best by far was a drink called hot cold which consisted of pineapple lavender white chocolate and a coconut foam top\",\"i am glad my brother came to visit me otherwise i would not have ventured here on my own od is a very cool speakeasy we came on a thursday night to only two other patrons present but it was still a pretty great atmosphere thanks to the reviewer who mentioned looking for the crown above the door without it we would be lost while i am not one for cocktails i followed the reviews and ordered the off menu hot cold and jesus christ the most amazing cocktail i have had hot foam cold drink a dessert in a cup and granted you really did not taste much alcohol but it is delicious enough to overlook this fact my brother ordered the bee pollen and enjoyed his as well although likely not worth the price point it was regardless the vibe is very nice and i would recommend coming here at least once frequent visitors might find a large hole in their pockets\",\"not cheap easily a  to  us dollars but delicious and inventive cocktails in a space that is as cool as any trending speakeasy in new york or la absolutely unpretentious and chill the bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable part of the fun is hunting for its hidden entrance so enjoy the search the surrounding area is full of other bars and restaurants so you can easily make it a full night of barhopping\",\"as stolen from rachel r if you are looking for a glass of wine or a beer go somewhere else if you want incredibly creative cocktails this is the spot operation dagger was our rd stop on bar crawl in attempt to hit each singapore location on the world is best bar list we arrived right as they opened and enjoyed having the place and the bartenders to ourselves the menu is small but each drink is exceptionally well crafted the space is a little cold and uncomfortable but i ordered the hot and cold and it was the best alcoholic drink i have ever had without a doubt pineapple lavender white chocolate and coconut with a foam top be sure to sip deep enough to get the warm and cold liquids at the same time be sure to ask the bartender is what they recommend they know the menu better than anyone if you are interested in doing a similar bar crawl operation dagger is easy walking distance from the tippling club and exceptionally close to native world is  best bars  manhattan singapore atlas singapore operation dagger singapore  hongkong street singapore tippling club singapore native singapore\",\"this underground speakeasy is a must for your singapore adventures i read about it on a couple of sites so i was excited to experience it it is hidden so a little hard to find but there is a discreet crown their logo to help you know identify i was thankful to have a local who knew exactly where it was it is such a unique space once you get in very minimalist decor the huge lightbulb fixture over the bar is really interesting and makes for good pics as well as the liquor in the individual bottles on the wall i definitely fed into the hype but let is be clear this place will make a dent on your wallet with most drinks running at about sgd to sgd\",\"if you are looking for a glass of wine or a beer go somewhere else if you want incredibly creative cocktails this is the spot its an unmarked door on the left keep your eyes out for people exciting its quite loud on the weekend but they have great taste in music ask for the off menu hot cold a delicious combo of coconut foam with pineappley deliciousness prepare to become addicted\",\"relatively small bar with a cool vibe and unusual and creative drinks we were glad we were able to locate this bar and complete our mission\",\"this place really has something special here it is a must go if you love cocktails their bar snacks will beat most restaurants appetizers awesome staff and really intriguing menus\",\"it is cool it is a speakeasy but the drinks are ok nothing to write home to mom and dad everything pre mixed and all the staff could care less that we wee there to try out one of you asia is best bars\",\"whatever happened just before i went there i am not able to understand any good review for this hole at all besides quite unfriendly barkeepers and the fact that sitting in froint of the sink is definitely not a nice spot the drink that i was offered tasted like a mixture of dishwater and vinegar prepared in a small bowl and garnished with some dry thyme this was far away from anything being good perhaps i did not understand the drink concept perhaps they forgot some ingredients but no this bar will never be a target again\",\"the ambience for this bar is awesome love the drinks my favorite was hot cold had snow for starts and then had the bee pollen but that was not to my liking my friend ordered the gomaishio and that was too cucumber and ginger ish for me new york punch was really good toothe drinks are like  each pretty pricey but for the novelty i think it is okay the decor was cool too\",\"located on the nd floor of the  building in chinatown singapore you will not stumble upon this beer bar out of coincidence you will probably have to ask   people the location and address before you even get close to the proximity of this bar once you find it you have yourself one of the top beer bars in all of singapore i visited smith street taps on three separate occasions during my one week trip they are constantly rotating their taps and have very friendly helpful bartenders there are also many options for food as this bar is tucked away between food markets if you make it here on the weekend they have opened another location  meters away that serve local singaporean craft beer the name of this is smith street taps friends and you cannot miss it i also was able to host two bottle shares with local friends who i met with in copenhagen two years ago the international craft beer scene is always friendly inviting and you never know who you will see again down the road i would venture to smith street taps if you have a free night on the weekend\",\"this place makes a colorado guy feel right at home with a great selection of beers to choose from they also have a gluten reduced beer that my wife can drink who has a mild sensitivity to wheat so that is a win too seriously check this place out for quality beer on tap and excellent service as well the satay around the corner makes for a tasty snack also\",\"smith streets taps as others have mentioned has a great selection of beer on tap and quite a few bottles the best part the hawker stalls come here to enjoy cheap food while drinking delicious brew the service is always very friendly and the owner knows a lot about beer and great places to drink highly recommend\",\"nice spot in the hawker center they have a lot of imported beers they had some from australia hong kong and the uk they had a big variety i had a pineapple sour from australia the beers here are a bit more pricey compared to the other beer stall these are around s  it is pretty popular lots of tourists worth a stop for some good beers\",\"wow great find in china town they have a load of beer on tap and in bottles on tap from singapore uk and u s they face smith street on the nd level nice breeze and food all around in the hawker stand the owner is nice but ray who works there is awesome chat him up for his lore knowledge on beer most beers ran\",\"wow beer o clock fo sho superb selection of import beers at almost reasonable prices stone ipa for  can you believe it it would be amazing if there was a bbq smokehouse hawker stall next door but i can dream or order uber eats to deliver decker to the hawker center\",\"finally awesome beer place knowledgeable staff i am finally home this place carries even the most obscure beers they even have modern times on rotation that is like the most niche of all san diego beers i had a great conversation with the owner so cool to speak beer to someone here on the island i love the fact that this place is in he chinatown hawker center of all places i will be coming back again and again since they have a rotation selection of great craft brew thank you smith street you have saved me\",\"i really wanted to have craft beer under ac but looking at  perfect reviews here it was hard to resist giving it a shot it is not so hot at night anyway and there is plenty of seating bottles at the good beer company taps here take your pick a ml glass is   the usual in singapore cannot help the alcohol tax the selection is great as amply detailed in the other reviews service is very fast the biggest difference compared to a typical crafts beer place is that you are sitting in what is probably the largest hawker in singapore with over  stalls so you can eat whatever you want and it will cost very little maybe a tenth of what you would normally pay for your hipster bbq or quinoa salad or mexican several of the stalls are well known so just google chinatown complex stalls before you head out although we had no bad experiences in the evening the queues are much better chilling out with great hawker food a glass of cold craft beer in the hand on a warm quiet night just a couple mrt stops from home the cbd towers lit up in the distance it is a pretty good experience and i think we will be back often\",\"what is going on in the chinatown food complex there are two of the best places for craft beers in the country almost next to each other this place does also have excellent selection friendly and knowledgeable staff they have their beers on tap rotating selection and prices are very reasonable to be in singapore as with the good beer company it is a plus that one can grab cheap and mostly good food from the surrounding food stalls\",\"in direct proximity of the phenomenal good beer company is another stand that creates a dynamic duo of drunken deliciousness where gbc has bottles sst has rotating drafts most of which are solid winners even in the sweltering heat hearing a nearby stand blast chinese pop music from broken speakers i feel transported back to boston if only for a moment it is my cure for homesickness looking forward to my next treatment\",\"i am so glad that i decided to come back here because this is certainly one of those places that you really have to check out if you happen to be in singapore if you are getting sick of being offered the standard beers such as tiger or even simply paying through the nose then make your way down to the chinatown complex and check this place out though it does not open until about   pm this and it is sister the good beer company are one of those secrets of singapore that unless you are either in the know or simply a gun and locating things on the internet or you simply jump on yelp and type in bars you would probably end up missing this place and if you are a beer connoisseur then you will simply have to make you way back here where the good beer company serves bottles this place serves beers on tap and from what i am told it is even rotated okay you do have to put up with the fact that it is in a hawker centre but then again those places are pretty cool in and of themselves this place just makes them even better\",\"the good beer company has metastasized apparently the owner daniel was no longer able to live with the limitation of the bottle only format so he teamed up with meng chao brewers craft and opened a second nearby stall with taps singapore is first draft beer only hawker stall i have stopped by a few times since their recent soft opening and i am thrilled currently they have  rotating taps with great offerings so far i have seen rogue deschutes hitachino nest and jungle beer and they always keep sapporo on tap if you want something light the price is right starting at  for the sapporo and going up to  for the craft beer no food of course but it is in the chinatown complex smith street hawker center so it is surrounded by excellent food stalls\",\"drunk review jush kidding do not tell your friends about thish place just bring them here excellent beers and they will fill your growler too\",\"after trekking around the food court for an hour and been given directions to taps on smith i finally found it but it was closed so pay attention to both the stall number and business hours but i came back at  pm to enjoy there lovely fruit saison while worth the wait\",\"smith street taps is the real deal craft beer for the people at a people friendly price bosses daniel and meng chao are very knowledgeable and the modest tap selection is tightly edited and balanced to offer something for novices and hardcore hopheads check out their facebook page before dropping by to see what is on tap\",\"blk  smith street chinatown complex is massive but what really sets this place apart are the number of excellent beer stalls here it takes awhile to go through the maze but you are rewarded by  solid options of which smith street taps was my favorite they carry a line of approximately  craft beers ranging from hoppy american ipas to german wheat beer to japanese craft beers prices are at least   cheaper than at a proper restaurant or bar so if you deal with the heat and minimal amenities this is the place to go plus you can order just about anything in terms of food so that is a plus too although i would to have some good tacos here my friend and i made it through half of the beers here and our fave was the  hop ipa by deschutes the selection changes frequently so do not get too attached to a certain beer but the line up is always interesting the two guys running the place are super friendly and knowledgeable hint take good note of the stall number unless you need the exercise definitely a gem and a great find in singapore\",\"smith street taps is a hidden gem in the singapore beer scene taps rotate with a mixture of micro brews and old world draught beers the staff are knowledgeable and friendly\",\"this is the sister stand of good beer company ran by the same owner and with an amazing selection of beer on tap they always have some really rare stuff including some whisky barrel aged and bourbon barrel aged beer this week from the u s but the selection almost always has some japanese some german and a mix of uk and nz\",\"i came across man man some time ago while walking from duxton road to keong saik road i only mention this bit of information because man man is tucked in the back of a shophouse which faces keong saik road while man man itself faces a pedestrian access path park that people typically use as a shortcut despite it is hidden location apparently queues here for their dinner service can reach up to an hour or more having just had lunch there i hate lining up i can see why people go through the trouble of waiting at the top of the steps and just inside the glass doors leading into man man are  large thigh high tanks with water flowing into them these tanks are home to live anguilla japonica japanese eels or once grilled unagi it is quite fitting that one is first encounter upon stepping foot into man man is the main course because it truly is the star of the show here the restaurant has tables spread out in the oddly shaped space along with a bar counter that faces both the chopping board where the eels presumably shuffle off their mortal coil and the binchotan grill where they get transformed into unagi the menu features several types of hitsumabushi a specialty of nagoya city unadon and smaller side dishes such as unagi cooked in tamago i settled on a large unadon which was served within   minutes and was the perfect size for lunch without going into too much detail not all unagi is created equal and sometimes you end up with something that has the consistency and texture of chewing on a rubber hose this is not the case at man man where they serve the real deal and which is the perfect combination of flaky meat combined with the slight crunchy chewiness of the charred skin barring a plane trip to japan this is one of the most authentic unagi meals you will ever have anywhere with my benchmark being marushizu in tokyo coming to a total of s   after service and tax it is also a lot cheaper than that plane ticket for that price you will not leave hungry as the unagi is served on a generous portion of rice with a small tofu appetizer gari pickled ginger and a bowl of suimono clear soup along with a cup of cold barley tea the only thing i recommend is asking for the sansho pepper as a touch of the ground pepper really rounds out the flavor of the unagi oh and they have takeaway too if you really hate lining up\",\"we came here at   pm on a monday and there was no line taste   if you love unagi your dream will come true really flavorful unagi perfect sauce on top and perfectly bbq the level of attention to its detail is great love the fresh wasabi you are getting for you to make fresh wasabi yourself price value   for a midsize set you pay s  and for a large set s  yes it is more expensive than hawker center but you get quality food and we are talking about unagi a fresh wasabi a soup and you get a good portion of it i would recommend the large size if you crave unagi i ordered the midsize one and regretted after the first bite to not have taken the large size onethis place is perfect for lunch or generally if you just want to get food quickly it is not a place for a candle light dinner where you sit for hours we would come here again for sure\",\"easy to get to from the mrt when i got here there was a long line in the rain but the unagi was so worth it by far the best unagi i have had the unagi was so fresh delicate yet we will flavored there are freshwater eels in the restaurant in a tank so i am guessing thats how the freshness is maintained the bento don let is you experiment with how you want to eat it with soup wasabi seaweed sauces or all of the above it is a little pricey at  but definitely worth it when you feel like treating yourself\",\"man man is a very well known restaurant in singapore and i can definitely see why now the unagi here is some of the best that i have ever had just know that the queue can get quite long so i would recommend showing up before it opens otherwise you will end up waiting outside in the heat this place is a bit pricey as well you will probably spend around s  per person here food unagi hitsumabushi this is basically an unagi don set with a broth that you can pour on to the rice plus miso soup i would definitely recommend adding the broth as well which mixes fantastically with the taste of the unagi i got this in the regular size and this was plenty of food for me unagi bone crackers we got this as an appetizer and it was surprisingly good the crackers are very crispy and had a nice smokey taste to them wait i arrived at  am on a saturday for lunch it opens at   and waited about min i have heard the line can definitely get over an hour so would recommend going early if possible\",\"definitely something to get when you missed the unagi don from japan their hitsumabashi is really what you will get at japan totally in love with the crispy soft texture good stuff that is worth our time to queue for it\",\"be prepared to queue for a long time for this place but it is completely  worth it because eating here was spiritual experience for me all the ingredients are so fresh the taste of everything is perfect the unagi is so crispy yet tender because it is grilled to perfection they give you real wasabi to grate and that was so delicious i honestly savored every bite i could eat this every day\",\"man oh man what a unagi place ever since i watched friends i have been wanting to eat japanese unagi but all past attempts were just soso even in japan and in my opinion could never compete with western eel dishes however as i am a sucker for japanese food i had to give unagi one more try thank god i did because the hitsumabushi set eel three ways is one of the most delicious meals i had in a long time i had the large set it was way too much food but i still finished all since it was so good aaaaaand although the restaurant is super busy the service is awesome all wait staff is mega friendly and attentive yes for regular tea top ups so delicious food and awesome service  stars worth the hype\",\"extremly delightful i was visiting my gf in sg and she took me to this unagi heaven the signature menu with seaweed soup is worth to have if you are planning to visit sg this is where you must go\",\"oooooh nagiand so the  michelin singapore guide is out with a bunch of new entries and new recommendations one of them man man japanese unagi restaurant i have heard the reviews i have seen the queues and i have to admit my first reaction was crazy i wo not queue for that how wrong i was if not for my colleague suggesting man man for a group dinner i might have never gone to try it despite my love for unagi  tip if you are going to be arriving anytime after  pm be prepared to wait we got there at  pm our office is pretty nearby and still ended up being the  th group in the queue the restaurant is small and cozy and really reminds you of japan what makes this restaurant different from other restaurants serving unagi the unagi is freshly killed skewered and grilled in the restaurant medium donburi   we decided to go with the basic although the sight of everyone having the hitsumabushi made us regret that decision a bit oh well gives me a reason to come back after one bite all i could say was life changing what ever idea i had of what a good unagi should be and taste like went completely out the window the sauce was flavourful without overpowering the natural sweetness of the eel and the eel oh my it was tender juicy it melts in your mouth and tasted so pure i cannot even find the right words to describe it bottom line i can see why it received its bib gourmand only draw back would be the queue but despite that it still easily gets  stars from me\",\"man man unagi stands out in singapore as a restaurant that is passionate about serving quality authentic chargrilled unagi at accessible prices the entrance is humbly tucked in a back alley that you might not notice if you were not looking for it as you walk in you are greeted by nothing less than two pools of live unagi i like a restaurant that knows what they stand for and is not shy about it around  pm on a thursday there was not too much of a line and we were seated almost immediately most of the tables are cozy which is typical of a japanese restaurant so smaller groups are more ideal most come here to try unagi three ways and that is exactly what i got the butamabushi for s   the unagi was so fresh and perfectly basted basically the three ways are unagi with rice unagi mixed with the side ingredients seaweed scallion and wasabi and lastly unagi with the ingredients and with a soup dashi broth you actually divide the serving into four parts and the last part is eaten in your favorite way my favorite was with seaweed and a hint of wasabi the refillable ice green tea was also very welcome and i am glad they did not pinch on small things like drinks we also got a small side dish of unagi bone crackers for s  which probably was not necessary but it was different and fun bravo for going all out on unagi by sourcing and preparing it like nobody else in singapore\",\"they basically do one thing here and it is eel also it is really good i mean really really good there will probably be a line formed outside at any time of the day do not hesitate to wait in that line because the absolutely fresh barbecued eel on rice is worth it they have a tank of eels in the restaurant and so your meal was probably swimming  minutes before you ate it the portion is good sized but not huge so at least order the medium size eel rice bowl which is about  us\",\"the restaurant was the latest by chef teppei interestingly the entrance to the place was at the back reached the place about  minutes before it opened and there was a queue of about  persons in front of me the  counter seats were the first to fill up the place was quite smoky one could even smell the smoky grilling smell before entering the place the place was decorated in a light wooden look by the way i did see a customer who bought a couple of fresh eels back too tables were placed quite near to each other there was barely place for bags but lucky i selected a table by the shelf therefore got place in the shelf for bag on the table there was condiments such as sweet sauce unagi sauce spicy japanese pepper and chilli powder to help yourself to refillable iced tea was served kimoyaki liver   looked quite charred it was chewy with smoky although it was a tab bitter at certain parts yahatamaki   unagi roll stuffed with pickled radish in it crunchy and tangy large kouhaku histsumabushi   unagi served with mentaiko sauce soup pickles broth spices the dish was a january special to eat histsumabushi divide the serving into  parts  have one serving in the small bowl which is also known as torizara to enjoy the dish in its original tasteyakumi second serving add the yakumi condiments such as fresh wasabi chopped spring onions and green onions i spend quite a lot of time busy grating the wasabi the fresh wasabi really peaked up the dish  third serving add the lightly flavored dashi made from simmering fish or meat broth the dish reminded one of teochew porridge  eat the last serving the way you like best as for me i like it with the broth and freshly grated wasabi in it the layer of mentaiko sauce was a tab too little to make a different to the dish although there was long queue most customers finished their meals quite fast\",\"love this place a lot they import their live unagi from japan and they guarantee that this is the cheapest place to enjoy japanese unagi in sg my partner had the kabayaki unagi set   and i had the shiraiyaki set with the same price the unagi tasted really really fresh my partner and i agreed that man man unagi tasted better than the one in japan with one michelin star we also had mini unagi with vinegar as appetizer really nice but a bit too salty and tamago which was really fluffy delicious i was also lucky because i did not have to queue as i came during odd hour otherwise be prepared to wait at least an hour location a little hidden but the area outside the restaurant is very conducive for queuing me thinks\",\"really nicely chargrilled unagi shipped in weekly from japan and grilled by a team of japanese pretty authentic experience however do not think the broth meal is worth getting not too much a difference for the three different ways you can have the unagi and rice then again we were not porridge people  odd for a meal hearty and nice though long crowds expected due to the small restaurant tucked in keong siak worth the wait though\",\"the best unagi i have ever eaten i did not know about this place until my friend recommended to me you wo not miss this place with its long queue outside the entrance everyone is orderly with a small number queuing right outside the door and an empty passage way for pedestrians to walk through then the longer queue starts so do not be deceived if you only see a few people at the door my friend and i waited an hour which would have been longer if we were a bigger group the place is pretty small which explains the long queue we got a seat near the counter where they prepared the food we were lucky to face the side of grilling the unagi instead of the side of slicing the unagi which was quite a bloody and unpleasant sight you can also choose not to look up and just dig into your food the unagi had really crispy skin and tender meat to justify the waiting time to myself i ordered the medium portion which was definitely filling and satisfying we each paid about  which is value for money given the quality and portion of the food service was also polite and pretty attentive\",\"what a sinful saturday this is my second attempt to dine in this restaurant first time i quit because the queue was ridiculously long and i determined that i would succeed this time the dinner starts at pm we arrived at pm and we were the second in the queue less than mins another  more group arrived and by  pm i could not see the tail of queue at all not exaggerating it is really loooooooong queue it is a small restaurant and if you miss the first round it will take another hr to come to your turn they do not limit the time means you can eat as slow as you want the unagi is so delicious it is so fresh as they slaughter the eels on the spot it is so yummy that the price is no longer important the staffs are very friendly and know very well the food they serve i ordered hitsumabushi and i love it i am not a porridge person but i am really falling in love with this one my favorite is adding the unagi rice to the soup and sprinkle the spring onion and seaweed and i like to grate some fresh wasabi on top the price range is  per person reasonable for this quality\",\"having lived in nagoya i really miss hitsumabushi or grilled eel eaten several ways e g with rice with wasabi with soup etc my benchmark for hitsumabushi is atsuta horaiken in nagoya so it is quite high so i was excited to hear from my japanese salon that a place specializing in hitsumabushi opened up nearby i finally had a chance to check out man man and i can say that the experience exceeded expectations sure it helps that the eels are shipped live from the nagoya region but the execution of the dish also was excellent with just the right amount of sauce and char service was also excellent and no service fee either the place fills up quickly on weekdays for lunch but seems to also empty fairly quickly so if you would like to avoid a queue come a bit later around  definitely a great addition to the japanese food scene in singapore\",\"wow it was my first time and i wow the suitable word in describing what i had my hr queuing is paid off the grilled unagi is sooo tasty and chewy the unagi sauce tastes really good make sure that you have it on definitely will come back again\",\"a very small restaurant that specialises in eel rice the food gets five stars the eel is chargrilled to perfection and served on a bed of short grained white rice with a side of fresh wasabi the price is reasonable for the quality this place does not take reservations so wait times can be long the line that forms outside the restaurant on the park connector makes it awkward for others using the park connector the ventilation of the restaurant is also wanting you will leave smelling like grilled fish\",\"dining here was a real treat i enjoyed the venue so much located inside a large contemporary museum it is not often you get to walk thru a closed museum so quiet then into an intimate bustling and oh so charming restaurant like this it is a step back in time with history lining the walls in framed photos and culture embodied in the gorgeous chandeliers and artworks a classy night out so dress up a bit to feel part of the ambiance service was some of the friendliest we have had anywhere host made excellent suggestions we enjoyed every dish reservations normally a requisite though we got lucky arriving without because a party had finished early and they graciously accommodated us\",\"i think we had the miss here in the hit or miss situation i was at a work holiday party a few weeks ago and learned my colleague next to me at dinner used to live in singapore he told me to eat here and order buah keluak ayam as it would change my life i made reservations for dinner which we had last night when i mentioned to people we were going here there was a lot of hype someone said the chef is a national treasure the concierge at our hotel said she has not been able to get into the restaurant as a local and was surprised i was able to secure a reservation the anticipation was really high our chinatown tour guide also shared with us about the peranakan people and culture to prepare us for peranakan cuisine when we arrived the host expected us asking lisa first he seated us at a table in a high traffic area but we moved to a quiet side space the restaurant is not very big so that might be why the reservations are hard to get it turns out my mom was sitting in the same seat michelle obama had been sitting in  days prior as the host shared a photograph of her sitting at the table with him shaking barack obama is hand we started with this fried tofu skin stuffed with crab shrimp chicken and water chestnuts it was kind of like an over fried shrimp toast my mom suggested for our dishes my mom ordered butter prawns i got the buah keluak ayam and eric r ordered the beef rendang the server recommended nasi lemak coconut rice for eric r and my mom and jasmine rice for my dish when the dishes came out eric r was the lucky one his had a lot of flavor and spice and we all liked it his beef was also very tender my mom is dish was prawns in shell that were not cleaned with very little flavor topped with egg floss which was not mentioned when she asked questions about the dish the server warned me that the dish i ordered some people love it and some people do not but i was adamant that i must see if it will change my life the story of the buah keluak ayam is chicken stewed in a sauce with the buah keluak a swamp based nut that is a poisonous fruit only the peranakan people know how to cook it without killing people it holds hydrogen cyanide which has been used in chemical weapons the peranakan people scoop out the center of the fruit ferment it underground in ash for  days and put it back in then boil it to remove the poison a demitasse spoon was provided to scoop out this nut and mix it with my rice which was adorned with fried shallots then drizzle some sauce and supposedly i would have some sort of food nirvana unfortunately the buah keluak did not taste like the truffle of the swamp as i had hoped it would based on my colleague is enthusiasm for the dish we also were essentially ignored by staff through much of the experience and with tiny water glasses we were often without drink eric r is dish was very spicy so he asked a server to leave a pitcher of waster but the server refused eventually we were served a complimentary warm tapioca cake with palm sugar syrup coconut milk and coconut ice cream to cool eric r is mouth and perhaps make up for poor service the best parts of the meal were the rendang and the dessert we left a bit disappointed with the experience given all of the hype but it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to try peranakan food so now we can say we did\",\"the decor of this place is on point you can definitely find an instagram moment here the server who greeted us was very friendly and handsome he seated us and then ended up being our server too it is a pretty small place but i imagine that he was spread a little thin he maintained a helpful and friendly vibe throughout the whole meal and we were there pretty late in the evening i ordered a drink called a haliatini which was probably the best drink that i have had since i can remember the price is pretty standard for singapore probably even a little less given that this is a nice restaurant we ordered the chicken wings and satay to start both were excellent the wings came with this spicy fishy sauce and the peanut sauce with the satay was on another level for main courses we got the daging chabek beef cheeks and the garam assam fish both had some much flavor some spicy heat and everything else very well balanced and all of that was the perfect amount of food for two people who heavily eat for the price point this place is worth it the only negative criticism that i have to say is that the napkins are paper which kind of makes it feel like it is not as nice as it is but since this is in a museum i am guessing that it is because washing cloth napkins might not be a feasible option a very small detail and in the end who cares especially because i recently got yelled at somewhere else gaggan for being too messy on my cloth napkin\",\"the national gallery is a treat to be walking around and even more so when you find yourself in a gastronomic beckoning called the national kitchen black panels with gold trims and a strangely harmonious cacophonyof floor tiles the atmosphere is elegantly singaporean the black leather upholstered seats however is in a sad state of disrepair and really needs to be replaced the back of my thighs were constantly reminded of how beat up they are food good end of story solid mustard green duck soup just right amount of sour kueh pie tee is a generous helping  altogether unlike candlenut with its skimpy  and of course i showed up for the buah keluak noodles could have sworn this was called buah keluak spaghetti at the bt timah branch and it did not disappoint noodles was al dente and buah keluak sufficient there was an undertone of coconut milk solid service\",\"nice old school classy restaurant food is good but i do not think it is worth the price to pay for the food ordered the coronation chicken appetizer cod with laksa sauce and the eggplant sambal the service was really good and attentive once i actually got to order it was a little slow to start overall i think it is a good place to visit once to see what the hype is all about if i was to return i do not think i would immediately return here\",\"what a treat had some time and a colleague took me here the service is very stately though friendly the decor gorgeous and if you can spare the time take a look at the various displays its not a lot but still enjoyable to peruse the food is flavorful complex and delicious the presentation is also very appealing we ordered the sambal eggplant if you like eggplant get this also had the fried bean curd salad definitely ensure you add the cucumber papaya julienne on top of the bean curd with that rich deep sauce and let the flavor explosion begin we had several other dishes all wonderful unfortunately as i was visiting i do not recall all the names the server was also very helpful as he heard our initial order and mentioned it would be a lot of food and helped us pare down vs focusing solely on getting the largest order\",\"nice ish singaporean traditional food in the national galleryfood tastes pretty good though a bit sweet overall details by dishes below beef rendang very tender perhaps even slightly too tender for our liking satay well grilled a good starter dried laksa an interesting take on the classic sg dish the dried version does not short change the laksa taste at all still retains that fragrance and touch of spicebeautiful ambiance a good spot to bring out of town guests\",\"there are two words that should describe this place dry laksa the preparation of this singaporean staple is simply phenomenal with a burst of many unbelievable flavors that have spice tanginess and light sweetness of the coconut all of which merge to create a dish with an unbelievable flavor profile admittedly i will not call myself a laksa expert as i was in singapore quite briefly but i do know a mouthwatering preparation of a dish when i try one this is an absolute must the establishment as a very beautiful interior and is located in the national gallery thus there is a museum like feel to the entire establishment it is grand and beautiful but dishes are priced very fairly and not over the top as many restaurants in singapore would be with this type of ambiance our waitress was pleasant and attentive giving great recommendations from the menu to help newbies into singapore food scene get oriented quickly i really enjoyed the singapore sling here as well the cocktail was made with great proportions and was a perfect refreshment for a warm summer evening it is unique flavor and festive appearance can serve as a complementing detail to an otherwise very grand environment aside from the dry laksa tried a couple more dishes and was very impressed tau hu goreng fried bean curd with cucumber and bean sprouts topped with peanut sauce interesting dish despite its simplicity but cannot say it was to my flavor profile personally kayu pie tee fried rolls with bamboo quite delicious and unique a flavor unlike anything one would experience in the western world there is no wonder that this restaurant sits in the michelin guide for singapore it is a phenomenal combination of elegance authenticity and reasonable pricing\",\"i stopped by this place to get some afternoon desserts with my family friend after walking around the national gallery we got  desserts and the chicken satay although there was a little too much chicken skin for me the satay had really tender meat and seasoned pretty well the kueh beng kah was a sticky cake with nice coconut and caramel flavors the pilot hitam was my favorite it is black glutinous rice with coconut milk and coconut ice cream the rice stew is not as thick as other places but i liked how i could the coconut flavors really came out especially with the ice cream the hot rice with the cold ice cream gave the dessert a nice twist the service was great i remember a server brought us bowls to share our dessert before we even asked him to the decor is really classy with mirrors all around and hints of gold but also has elements of traditional south east asian architecture like bamboos apparently the menus are different at each location so i would want to try out their other dishes next time\",\"violet oon is a renowned chef in singapore specializing in peranakan cuisine which blends chinese dishes with southeast asian spices and cooking techniques the cuisine has a large base in malay food such as the rending and coconut milk is a major ingredient in many entrees dishes from northern malaysia have more of a thai influence while those from malacca and singapore carry more of an indonesian influence this cuisine is the finest of asian fusion turmeric chicken wings a plant of the ginger family which is prominent in indian and se asian cuisines this deep orange color powder is an essential ingredient of curries by itself it has a very distinct aroma and flavor which is peppery and slightly bitter coated in a thin layer of turmeric batter with a hint of lemongrass and deep fried to perfection these wings were some of the best that i have ever had beef rendang this se asian rendition of a beef stew was packed with explosive flavors and was served in a rich and spicy hot creamy coconut sauce the beef was melt in your mouth tender the sauce carried just the prefect level of heat for me slightly burning hot but not overwhelming i think the coconut milk had a soothing effect and made the heat more enjoyable spoon a healthy portion over steamed rice and enjoy this foodie is dream come true dry laksa laksa is a rice noodle shaped almost like spaghetti and is often served with soup just like chinese noodle soups the dry version however was soupless but was instead sauted in a delicious house gravy this dish also carried robust and explosive flavors that were stimulating to the palate the deveined and deshelled prawns that came with it were tasty and fresh kueh beng kah if there is something known as a life changing dessert then this must be it this tapioca cake looked innocently like an ordinary slice of cheesecake but was actually a slice of heaven in disguise the cake had a good balance between softness and springiness was browned on the top but moist inside it was mildly but not overly sweet perfect and had a refreshing and delightful taste it was topped with gula melaka palm sugar syrup and served with a side of warm coconut milk\",\"fish lovers paradise if you love fish or shellfish you will love this restaurant it is inside the national gallery building on the nd floor attentive waitstaff lovely ambiance dcor food beautifully presented and served family style some dishes are spicier than others so start slowly be aware if anyone in your group has a shellfish allergy i booked a group of  and we had a set menu\",\"ok so after getting in some history i was treated to this wonderfully appointed restaurant i enjoyed the authentic food although some of the dishes were too spicy for me if you have a high tolerance for spicy you may love it\",\"violet oon is a hometown proud celebrity chef and national kitchen is her dedicated exhibit within the national gallery to peranakan food everything here is slightly more upscale in its decor and food preparation so you will find a  hainanese chicken rice among other popular dishes priced upwards the cocktails are good too i suppose in keeping with both its upscale nature and its singaporean hospitality my crummily dressed self was seated in a far back corner behind the bar unseen by the top echelon of singapore is diners it also meant that service was slightly subpar as being in the dark corner made getting waiter attention difficult nonetheless i was in it for the food and it was fairly delicious i started with a meaty duck soup this was followed by a malaysian spicy noodle dish that was actually made with spaghetti pasta and the starter was brought last an oversized plate of turmeric chicken wings that had good flavour to them and again very sizable and meaty i would save this place for a special occasion but having preceded a visit here with a visit to the peranakan museum it seemed a suitable way to end the day\",\"when in singapore you must try peranakan or nyonya cuisine what is it well it is essentially the result of melting chinese malay and indonesian cuisine into one which is pretty representative of singapore violot oon is one of singapores original celebrity chefs she is been doing this for over  years i had the chance to enjoy a meal at national kitchen during my stay in singapore and it did not disappoint the place situated on the second floor of the national art gallery national kitchen by violet oon makes you feel as if you have entered a french salon says conde nast traveler i mean just look at the place it actually reminded me of this little french restaurant in toronto called la societe the food mmmm so good for starters we had these little bundles of fried goodness called ngoh hiang  it is essentially deep fried prawns crab and chicken with water chestnut seasoned with five spice powder wrapped in bean curd skin dry laksa  i usually have the soupy laksa so this was a interesting change for me chap chye  it is a classic mixed veg dish really good but it was not anything special sambal petai with prawns  okay so this was interesting this is stinky beans fried in sambal shrimp sauce love sambal sauce but man i could not take the stinky beans please note that it was not the flavoring or how it was cooked in fact i loved the spices and the sauce i just was not a fan of the after taste that the stinky beans left tip you must try their kueh beng kah  super yummy tapioca cake toped with gula melaka syrup and coconut milk\",\"located in the beautiful national gallery with a fitting design style in the dining area high tea at national kitchen is a great experience and at a very reasonable price point service was exceptional every item was explained in depth the waiter let us try three different teas all of which were world class this place has both great style and food quality recommend making reservations even if the same day\",\"when in singapore have peranakan food we searched out national kitchen by violet oong after learning about the peranakan during our visit earlier to the national museum of singapore nearby hint take the guided tour we were not sure whether we could get into the national kitchen without paying for entry to the national gallery turns out we could the guard at the entrance was very helpful in showing us how to get to the restaurant on the second floor from the ground floor museum entrance the dishes were served famiy style which i love since i get a chance to try all the dishes we had a variety of dishes sambal kimchiam udang lily buds with prawns and starfruit sambal petai with prawns stinky green bean fried in spicy dried prawn sambal sauce with prawns dry med siam rice noodles with mee siam chili with prawns bean curd and chinese chivesgaram assam fishkuay pie tee famous must have the brown colored sauce is sweet the sambal is spicy all delicious when in singapore have peranakan food\",\"it is a very busy place so i thought it must be good ordered baked lobster not as good as it should be when it came up it was lukewarm and a bit tough to chew full of senior citizens not sure why think i am the only tourist dumb enough to order lobsters no one else there did salads are very fresh\",\"the food and drinks are quite expensive since the restuaurant is inside national gallery the environment and decoration add points\",\"i came here twice during my stay in singapore the food is exquisite duh it is violet oon oh but let is talk about the decore swoon you are instantly transported to  is peranaken wealth just so charming and lovely afterwards or before be sure to explore the original courts and the beautiful art exhibits throughout the national gallery love love love the national kitchen and if i ever go back to singapore i will go back to this beautiful perfect place\",\"violet oon has several restaurant locations throughout singapore this one is located in the city hall section of the national gallery it is not every day that you get to experience dining in a beautiful historic building that houses a stellar art museum it felt extravagant to go from viewing an amazing art exhibit to then dining in a lavishly opulent historic setting reservations are a must you can dine in the grand hall or on their scenic veranda the menu is focused on singaporean asian influences the service was fantastic they were very accommodating for those of us in the group with dietary restrictions the wine selection for a fancy spot was mediocre stick with the cocktails here i was with a large group and everyone enjoyed their food better than our expectations i had the house specialty the beef padang with coconut rice i could have eaten the coconut rice by itself it was phenomenal the local chicken rice was bland in comparison the beef padang paired with the coconut rice was one of my favorite dishes while in singapore note if you are low on fitbit steps just go to the bathroom a couple of times it is a trek to the restrooms located in the museum it is easy to get lost definitely ask the staff for directions they will actually walk out a bit with you and point you in the general direction until you find the signs that then lead you to the museum bathrooms in that section of the building\",\"this place is amazing it is bomb in nyc and it it bomb in singapore the pancakes and french toast are just soooo good place is open till  and sometimes pm breakfast till pm insane that is right there gets  stars place is small but they do a great job of placing tables for everyone they ended up giving us two tables because we ordered for five people even though there were only two of us blueberry pancakes fire my only complaint is they do not put the blueberries inside of the batter tastes so much better when inside walnut banana pancakes with a side of chocolate chips so good it is like a cookiebrioche french toast bomb great flavor nicely cooked egg white omelette with goat cheese mushroom spinach delicious nyc to singapore place is a staple\",\"so long as clinton street baking company continues to dish up the best pancakes i have ever had in my life be they in new york city tokyo or singapore i will continue to give them five stars star  how were the service and atmosphere this clinton street is a cute little one comparable to their tokyo location and while it lacked the natural light conducive to food photography i know i know i am sorry for even pointing that out the service was fast and friendly star star  how were the portions relative to the cost   for brioche french toast was pricey but very much on par with other spots catering to tourists and expats like clinton street and common man star stars  and  how was the food clinton street continues to dish up the best pancakes in the world seriously i do not know how they do it and especially how they maintain consistency internationally but these fluffy cakes of goodness are so flavorful and go so well with the blueberries and maple butter syrup that it is just impossible to compete two stars star  would you be excited to go back always star\",\"i wanted to go here for the past two days for breakfast but it was so crowded today i waited until the afternoon and had a late late breakfast i got the banana walnut pancakes and they were delicious looking around all the food that people ordered looked good\",\"definitely on the pricey side but that is to be expected of most of the restaurants in the downtown area i went for breakfast and the food was amazing with a variety of american style options to choose from i shared the chocolate chip pancakes and a scrambled eggs dish and both were fantastic the pancakes were fluffy and the chocolate chips were a perfect complement it was such a sweet rich dish and i wish i had gotten a larger share i split between  people though so that should not have been a surprise the eggs were delicious and the biscuit that came with it was amazing so buttery and satisfying i would definitely recommend getting a few things to split because then you can try multiple offerings next time i am in singapore i will definitely come back\",\"the pancakes are insane went here for breakfast and we ordered heuvos ranchis and the salmon omelette both were ok but nothing special next we ordered the chocolate chip pancakes i believe they are one of the best pancakes i have ever tasted they are hot fluffy and the chocolate chip are melted inside them plus the pancakes are hot such that the chocolate chip sprinkled above them can easily melt other than the perfect pancakes the maple syrup that comes with it is also perfect it is not your average maple syrup\",\"i am not a huge fan of pancakes and that is not because i do not enjoy them i do i really do it is just that not everyone perfects them my husband and i were in singapore for a couple of days and we both like our meals to be delicious so my husband found this place mostly because they have good pancakes based on the reviews he read and we decided to give it a try we both ordered our pancakes with chocolate chunks when the waiter brought the pancakes to our table they looked like regular pancakes however the moment i drizzled the buttered maple syrup on top of the fluffy round edges of my pancake i immediately knew that this one is going to be one of the best i ever had and i was right the buttered maple syrup was so darn good to the point that without it the pancake would not taste this incredible my husband loved it and so did i glad we gave it a try now i think you should\",\"outstanding pancakes the portion sizes are a little intimidating so if you do not tend to eat much i would recommend sharing one dish with a friend i had the blueberry pancakes as well as a mocha the mocha was good but the pancakes were where they shined\",\"good american style food large portions good coffee and tea recommended pancakes are huge and tasty bacon is crunchy and very nice\",\"favorite brunch place in town always bustling atmosphere whenever we drop by expect a waiting list during weekends chicken waffle is definitely a must try we have tried the huevos rancheros sugar bacon burger as well which really are not bad at all overall everything in this place are cooked tastes well\",\"great american styled brunch option the biscuit was perfect the portions were big would definitely go back if visiting the country again\",\"best fluffy pancakes in singapore love the sausage patties huevos rancheros is my go to dish the only item i would say does not tickle my fancy is the sugared bacon i like my bacon unsweetened will try to order that next visit\",\"this is a great place to get breakfast all day long i ordered the pancakes with bananas and walnuts and was not disappointed the syrup is rich and flavorful the nuts are candies and the bananas are lightly dusted with sugar it does not look like a lot but it was very filling the restaurant is not very big so get here early or plan to wait for a table the prices are average for the area i will definitely return the next time i am in singapore\",\"clean and nice interior friendly staff however the food was not up to expectations the fried chicken waffle was horrible does not taste like good fried chicken and waffle was not crispy but soft the pancakes with blueberries were ok pretty thick pieces\",\"if you are looking for a typical american diner style breakfast clinton is is definitely the place for you the portions were more than generous though still not as massive as the portions in the states the food quality was pretty good as well i had the farmer is platter or breakfast cannot remember the exact title now and i loved how well the eggs were done slightly runny just to my liking everything was a little sweet as if coated with maple syrup but i think it blended well together i would definitely get the pancakes the next time i visit this place the nutella one looked awesome just to throw some caution they are pretty strict on reservations also they only can confirm a reservation of up to  pax any more they cannot confirm have to walk in\",\"by far the best western style breakfast brunch i have ever had in singapore i highly recommend the blueberry pancakes and the hash brown came in a party of  noting the portions of the people around we ordered a blueberry pancake a hash brown and a two eggs any style which we chose scrambled the blueberry pancakes extremely fluffy not at all dry with a fragrance that reminds me of nice waffles which on its own is already worth a   comes with the blueberry sauce which unlike typical jam type of sauce is not too sweet but somewhat tart very refreshing also comes with a small cup of maple butter oh the brilliance saves you the trouble of spreading the butter an extremely cumbersome process the maple butter is not too sweet with a flavour that is surprisingly not too heavy somewhat reminiscent of caramel and has a nice amber fragrance to it these  items eaten together is heavenly so overall a   for this dish without a shadow of doubt portion to us is too large for  person maybe closer to   persons for typical singaporean breakfast portioning the scrambled eggs well done nice butter fragrance nothing spectacular compared to the other  dishes   the has brown oh the hash brown drenched in buttery goodness with a mix of smooth mashed potatoes chunky potatoes and some portions that are fried crispy plain simple goodness made to perfection this to me overtakes the well done rosti at marche as the best rendition of a potato dish   all in all i am impressed i am not even sure why some people complain about the prices it appears expensive yes but that reflects the portion they are serving bring friends along to share and the prices are extremely reasonable coupled with the brilliant quality this is a no brainer never had a western style breakfast that truly impressed me in singapore this is the first\",\"the service was great and the atmosphere was too i ordered the blueberry pancakes and the veggie sandwich the veggie sandwich was good it was packed with avocados which is a plus but it is a little bit pricy the pancakes is however tasted incredible along with the warm maple butter and the blueberries on top of it   would recommend y all to come here just to get a taste of the pancakes\",\"tried the much lauded fried chicken today the chicken and waffles and chicken plate did not like the way the chicken was prepared for the waffles boneless fillets with a thin batter as it was rather dry chicken plate was very generous with literally half a chicken on the plate along with a decent chunk of corn bread and small token coleslaw the batter on the chicken plate was better buttermilk and had a good crunch unfortunately it was either bad old oil or the oil was too hot but ultimately had a burnt and slightly acrid flavour the flavour and seasoning was not great either so i found it rather plain overall i would go back for a shake or some of the desserts and maybe give the pancakes another shot all the other tables food looked well prepared and equally generous so value for money is decent by singapore standards for these sort of establishments service was clinical and efficient without being particularly friendly venue itself was quite cramped with tables extremely close to each other i went to the original store in nyc and was not that impressed by it either thankfully the ludicrous hype has died down and we got a table with no issues on a sunday at pm\",\"did not have to queue on a weekday afternoon blueberry pancakes  starsgood fluffy standard fare nothing spectacular imo i would have preferred plain maple syrup to the maple butter and would have liked more blueberries on top but there was a decent number of blueberries in the pancakes themselves spanish scramble  starsan omelette with chorizo and caramelized onions well done the brunch dishes taste better than those over at wild honey though wild honey is more conveniently located i would pick this one if i were picking based on food alone update  apr black angus cheeseburger    stars    stars for the price i like my math apparently everything on the burger the caramelized onions the cheese was good and the meat itself was juicy but bland i got it medium and it was still kinda red and oozed the fries were mediocre salty and crispy but again the taste was not great the slaw was alright i appreciated the pickle overall okay wifi only for phones they wo not type it in for your tablet or laptop  stars for the ambience nice bright and roomy\",\"back again on a saturday night for dinner and this time we had the angus cheeseburger chicken and waffle clinton st omelette and buttermilk biscuit sandwich oh and of course the blueberry pancakes friends loved the food particularly the blueberry pancakes and the buttermilk biscuit sandwich i had the chicken and waffle i would prefer if the chicken was more deep fried and crispy though the waffle was tasty with the maple butter the angus cheeseburger looked delightful and we particularly enjoyed the very tasty fries portions were satisfying and we barely had space for desserts could only make room for  pancakes amongst a party of  the bill was about  per person i had made reservations by phone which was painless though i wish they have an online option it is interesting that is not available considering the reservation confirmation was done via an automated system we will be back again to try more of their desserts\",\"this was easily the worst experience we had anywhere on our entire trip left waiting for  minutes to place our order while the table next to us seated after we arrived placed and received their order we were generally ignored by the staff and at the end we paid  extra for their service do yourself a favor and go elsewhere\",\"absolutely loved dining at colony i was warmly greeted and shown to my table and on the way set my eyes on the beautiful buffet the restaurant itself is tastefully designed and the lay out of the buffet flows nicely the selection is wonderful and clearly makes sure to incorporate local dishes naturally i sampled as much as i could and was pleasantly surprised to have found everything to be delicious from experience often not the case in buffet style dining the steamed salted egg bun specifically was phenomenal and is a must try every individual i encountered working at colony was exceedingly friendly and one of the chefs even posed the steamer baskets so that i could take a nice photo with the salted egg buns i will be visiting again on my next trip to singapore\",\"another day another lunch my girlfriend and i made plans to come here for a buffet lunch she was the one in charge of making reservation after all her dear friend was still fighting some jet lag demon which never want to go away she texted me and highlighted about the dress code lol i assured her there were no tees or shorts in my suitcase and flip flops i know better and she should know that p so everyone note there is a dress code at the colony and i hope everyone stick to that dress code not only out of respect for the restaurant but also out of respect for your fellow patrons as well i arrived  mins before noon the staffs were busy prepping for the lunch that starts at noon my girlfriend showed up and we just waited around the entrance and soon one staff came and checked us in i supposed one should definitely not try to walk in in order to dine here by this time the restaurant started to fill up with a lot of people who were all here for the buffet it was a far cry from  minutes ago when it was so calm and quiet ambience  i really like the ambience i like the natural light flowing in from outside and how bright the whole place is then what went wrong  there were some tiny fruit flies at the restaurant one was drinking the water condensation on one of our glasses but not before i ended it and my friend i each have taken the lives of one of those insects on our table  this is probably not the fault of the restaurant but i was not thrilled when there were so many noisy and unruly kids at the restaurant they were goofing around their table and i was so worried my bowl of piping hot noodles would end up on their heads trying to make my way back to my table with a plate of hot food while trying not to get bumped into by these kids i did not need that kind of stress to all those who like to dine at the colony and planned to bring your kid s if your kid s cannot behave and you cannot control your kid s please for the love of god do not bring them there food  the buffet was divided into many sections there was the chinese japanese local cold cuts seafood indian juices drink stand etc i have to say the colony did not fare well on the chinese food section just to point out a few  char siew pau bbq pork bun non fluffy and the filling was so dry shrimp dumpling filling was not tasty the skin though soft was funky chicken siew mai chicken dumpling not tasty bbq pork ribs looked absolutely delicious but they were so tough i made better ribs enough said there were a few things which i absolutely love or like  beef not sure what it was called so soft and  yummy  golden pineapple rice not bad at all herbal chicken soup wonderful blueberry iced tea think i had like   glasses so refreshing what could be better  the chinese food section of course cook those ribs longer please  pastries they were alright but i expect better service  staff was attentive and our water was constantly refilled plates were removed very promptly new cutlery was given every time we were done with our food i was absolutely happy with that most restaurants let one reused their cutlery i hate putting used fork and knife on the table however one question why did many other tables were served with coffee or tea no one came to ask us if we like to have coffee or tea hmmm\",\"this buffet was worth every dollar spent my wife and i celebrated our  year anniversary and part of our honeymoon at colony and it was everything i read about it and more buffets are typically unattractive gorge fest atmospheres filled with gluttony and sloppiness everywhere but colony puts a whole new spin on it the restaurant puts other buffets to shame adding a major touch of classiness and romanticism to it all the restaurant is located in the ritz carlton hotel and can easily be found in the lobby customers are first greeted by the patisserie section with its delectable collection of pastries and desserts before making their way onto the dining area after a quick glance one might even want to skip straight to dessert that is until they lay their eyes on one of the other  sections of the buffet besides the patisserie there is the following sections which are all connected to one another ice bar jumbo shrimp cocktail snow crab legs raw oysters mussels craw fish sashimi sushi etc grill rotisserie grilled ham brussels sprouts mashed potatoes sausage squash kale etc steam basket steamed dim sum buns ready to made hot pot food fish balls noodles etc wok chinese malay cuisine such as steamed fish chili crab fried rice prawns ribs vermicelli etc tandoor indian cuisine such as various curries basmati rice etc fruit stall juices and whole fruitsi probably did not come close to naming every single food that was served in each section but it should give any hungry person an idea prior to walking in i cannot fit a comment here on every single item but to summarize the seafood was extremely fresh the sushi was great for a buffet the hot foods from the chinese malay indian cuisine sections were very tasty we did not find a single thing wrong with anything we ate by far the most attractive section though was the patisserie the assortment of pastries and little desserts here and there were fantastic and any dessert lover is dream it really gave us the opportunity to sample away because they were small enough yes the buffet is  per adult for dinners and it is totally worth it with the amazing selection and chill atmosphere buffets are not typically thought of as date restaurants but colony really redefines what a buffet is on top of it all our waiter was excellent he knew we were here for our honeymoon and even gave us a quick tour of the buffet when we arrived so we would not get lost the perfect buffet if it is not it is damn close to it\",\"my favorite champagne brunch spot in singapore it use to be called the greenhouse the same space was renamed colony but the all you can drink and eat decadent buffet is pretty much the same as expected of a champagne brunch in singapore it has a full raw bar plenty of charcuterie a nice cheese selections some dim sum pasta and noodle stations a roast of some sort breakfast items soups salad bar and a variety of desserts you can eat for days but you only have a few hours to gobble down all this goodness nevermind the free flow vintaged brut or rose champagne and bloody marys champagne brunch in singapore is not a meal it is an event so bring an empty stomach and some great friends and prepare to have an amazing time getting stuffed on food and drink\",\"it is a promising buffet but like buffets food in general is good but never excellent they do offer a good variety of food noodle stand dim sum chinese bbq pizza burgers cheese table sushi seafood king crab legs shrimp oyster big dessert area with different chocolates ice cream and cake even nitro infused dessert made on the spot last thing a juice bar it was a bit pricey but with the selection it is fair dining area is good size and service was attentive\",\"i absolutely loved this buffet i came here for everyday for breakfast and lunch i would say the lunch is more spectacular than the breakfast spread they have sushi singapore food juices meats cheeses chinese food indian food a whole bread station and a beautiful dessert section lunch is special because you can get crab legs\",\"one of the highlights of our trip in singapore the buffet was to die for all you can eat sushi indian chinese dim sum soup etc it was amazing we also had the beverage package which came with bottomless wine our server was super sweet and really friendly everything we ate was delicious\",\"this place was excellent exactly what you would expect from a high quality buffet it had mainly malay chinese and indian food and every bit of it was so delicious i started off with the laksa which is one of my favorite dishes i have had in singapore then transitioned into the heavier foods they have a great spread of cold cuts pat and jamn ibrico aside a large selection of cheeses to choose from their sushi selection is not too extensive but it does have the main crowd favorites salmon tuna yellowtail they have both sashimi and nigiri as well as a few simple sushi rolls to choose from they had a great seafood selection and delicious fresh oysters too i loved their salted egg chicken wings they taste exactly like salted egg and are so so good very crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor i wish i had gotten more they also have a unique selection of bread the wheat and seaweed ones were my favorite the desserts were one of my favorite parts of the buffet there was every kind of pastry imaginable and you bet your ass i tried them all lol my favorites were the carmel brle truffles and gelato but there are so many more i am probably not remembering so be sure to give them all a taste they are small portions so as long as you pase yourself you should be fine the service was just as good as the food our server was cheetah i apologize i i spelled that incorrectly he was very attentive and checked up on us very frequently to clear our plates this place was a great experience but keep in mind it is very expensive we ordered all you can drink which was about  per person there were three of us and we totaled over  but this was for a special occasion and they even brought out a candle and a plate with not one but full of different pastries to sing me happy birthday\",\"the crowd as expected in a hotel is all tourists sometimes gems can be discovered in unexpected places despite the aging ritz carlton starting to appear more like an average marriott than a ritz the colony restaurant inside was a treat both in design and quality stepping into this uniquely designed space there is a sense of surprise and confusion the confusion arises from the vastly dispersed food selections throughout making the breakfast appear endless the dividers decorated with antiques and imagery of singapore provide a museum like feel to what would otherwise be a buffet selections are very vast making it difficult to make a decision every piece of the meal was amazing with the exception of one dish the chicken curry in the malay section which was not prepared well and the chicken very dry the service was spectacular and the buffet selections even beat out the st regis where we spent the last evening in singapore sitting next to the bamboo garden here is very relaxing and the building provides a fair share of natural light so do not get discouraged by the otherwise sad looking architecture of this building and the cramped boring entrance into the property this restaurant is a must for luxurious breakfast\",\"christmas hope log cake   starsdark chocolate ganache hazelnut biscuit gianduja crmeux raspberry mousse gelethis was pricey but absolutely delicious the cake was not too sweet and the flavors chocolate raspberry and hazelnut and textures the silky smooth cremeux melt in your mouth mousse and crunchy hazelnut complemented one another perfectly not to mention the fact that the cake was absolutely gorgeous with gold dust glittery gold streaks against the sheen of chocolate ganache and dark chocolate shapes that tasted divine i could not ask for more in a dessert best enjoyed at tea time with a cup of black coffee because i am usually too full after dinner and would not be able to appreciate it\",\"in one word awesome so much variety so much food good quality food make a reservation since it was quite well patronised even on a sunday there is lobster ball noodles really it is like a fishball duck and chicken rice northern indian food and naan and papadam leg of lamb and the usual suspects etc desserts a wide variety of desserts ice cream and i especially like the broken chocolate pieces like la maison is mendicant but only with nuts overall a good meal good service too\",\"i used to like to go to ritz carlton is colony restaurant for its buffet we went to colony this monday the restaurant was not full house though however we were given a make shift squeezed table of five by a service staff nina at first she refused to change table for us saying that the table is ok with  people and the restaurant was fully booked we told her to call for the manager then she agree to change to another proper table for  persons the food in the colony is getting very boring with declining quality the japanese counter sashimi and sushi are the standard offerings with no creativity the color and presentation of food were not attractive the worst is at the chinese counter the dim sum was terrible with no quality control the texture of dim sum was either rubbery and the sui mai texture was soft and starchy with no prawn and meat texture the laksa noodles gravy does not taste like laksa at all the gravy was over cooked with a burnt taste the dessert counter was boring and there were no outstanding desserts at all just average quality with variety i was not even tempted to take any dessert when i pass by the dessert counter service was excellent apart from the host blunder in table assignment i realized nowadays stars hotel like ritz carlton fullerton due to their reputation and good business have ignored their initial brand promise to customers they are sitting on their laurels because the numbers are good and get carried away with food quality and presentation of food no use of providing wide variety of food if as a six star hotel restaurants is unable to deliver a star professional attitude towards its operations in quality presentation and innovation of the food offerings to your customers i realized the so called  star hotel restaurants in singapore cannot be compared with those in thailand and hong kong the owners of  star hotels needs to shake up the hotel management staff and constantly keep them in checked to deliver the brand promise and commitment to their customers\",\"easily the highest quality buffet with so many options that i have ever been to this is the only buffet i have been to on multiple occasions that has been consistently high quality a bit of dim sum with some indian curry and some roast duck and some sushi top it off with a solid champagne and this place is everything desserts are phenomenal and i love that they make sure they have a local twist to most of them it is a great setting that everyone truly walks away happy i highly recommend for an excellent sunday brunch\",\"high quality buffet with ritz carlton service good food great selection especially for the sunday brunch and pricy\",\"great setup for breakfast and dinners broad range of cuisines fresh tuna and salmon sashimi salads chicken duck pork lamb beef fish prawns crab in addition to a range of indian malay and chinese dishes the desert range is fantastic in addition to ice cream and chocolate bars not bad for  ahi tuna salmon sashimi is very fresh braised red snapper is firm yet supple tandoori chicken spiced just right and the tiny sesame naans are but tasty\",\"what better way to start  than to write a yelp review for how  ended this is all about their nye buffet dinner oh what a night wow what a spread with quality festive party favours beyond just a hat free flow mot definitely check that alone is worth coming back service staff deserve extra brownie points for constantly being around and always having a yes we can attitude anticipating your needs generously topping up your champagne like there is no tomorrow clearing cutlery and plates that needed to be cleared and not those that you are still working on lending the young and old a helping hand whenever required always smiling making sure you have a great time and genuinely requesting your feedback food wise where do you start if cold seafood is your weakness you might well be stuck and not try anything but only inconvenience is the need to use your hands to prise open these succulent treasures but fear not as individual finger bowls are readily available and when you had enough of those aphrodisiacal oysters exploring colony will lead you to greater pleasures be it local or continental you will want one and also the other lobster laksa chilli crab tandoori and briyani with a whole lamb displayed spanish style sucking pig tomahawk steak beef wellington wagyu sliders bread and cheeses from every country ever however do pace yourself as the sweets sanctuary will make sure you and your stomach live happily ever after lessons learned drink do not drive oh and make sure someone else picks up the tab happy new year\",\"high end hotels in singapore know how to buffet colony is at the ritz carlton and  for dinner here is a steal what makes colony unique is that they not only have an impressive western selection but they have dedicated stalls that specialize in singaporean cuisine you can easily get famous dishes such as chicken rice chilli crab dim sum laksa with lobster and indian food here everything is high quality but if you are a tourist here i still recommend that you go outside and try all these at their respective restaurants for a more authentic experience as a resident here i decided to focus on their western spreads of course i loaded up on all the fancy cheeses and charcuterie i really enjoyed their roast along with all the curries in the indian section the desserts also had a western focus with things like cookies ice cream sundaes and pies though they did have some nice kuehs to choose from considering the ambiance and price this is a great place to go for special occasions with the family or celebrating a milestone birthday or job promotion with friends who are picky\",\"there are buffets and then there are buffets the colony at the ritz carlton is a buffet you literally dream about at some point during the buffet i literally thought i was stealing the sgd price per person vs the collection of food offered is simply absurd first the seafood bar is out of this world what buffet offers three types of oysters canadian french and irish so customers can different tasting oysters from sweet to salty to creamy to everything in between wow obviously these oysters are air flown from where ever they are located in the world so do not expect absolute freshness nevertheless it was more than satisfying next to the oyster baskets are whole crabs half cracked lobster claws the ones you find in maine mussels clams honestly i could not contain myself no where in singapore can eat  whole lobsters and a dozen oysters in one sitting and not break the bank other than the seafood bar there was a sushi sashimi bar indian buffet chinese singaporean buffet other note worthy dishes included all you can eat chilli crab claws butter grilled half cut lobster tails xo fried rice the ambience is great perfect for a friday night date and service is impeccable a must try indeed\",\"probably one of my favorite buffet spots in the city lovely colonial settings with a wide variety of meats cheeses warm charcuterie desserts food is delicious and the drinks are well balanced i have spent my birthday here brought friends here and if i could afford the calories i will be back sooner also when you are stuffed walk about the lobby of the ritz and admire the whimsical glass creations from chihuly i love chihuly\",\"after a six month period renovation the all time popular buffet restaurant arm of the ritz carlton millenia singapore opens with a new concept and name called colony which draws inspirations from the rich heritage of singapore is colonial history what could be better to relish an authentic afternoon tea experience than having a traditional british style three tier afternoon tea set here in fact decor is a key draw here i was instantly attracted to the eclectic settings when i stepped in adorned on the walls and partitions are old maps photographs alongside with vintage black and white crockery which i secretly wished i could bring some back home in line with the concept of the restaurant there is some local twist to what would otherwise be a strictly english tea the golden raisins and plan scones baked in house was served with scented kaya jam clotted cream and lemon curd which somehow reminds me of a delicious kaya toast when i put everything into my mouth the second deck and third deck feature an assortment of sandwiches and sweet pastries including a entire slab of peppered foie gras on beef pastrami simply too indulgent but if you jumped to the conclusion that it is the usual mixed of sweets savouries and scones then you are wrong it includes a plate of incredibly fluffy savoury pancake topped with sour cream and french caviar for that touch of luxe and when it comes to tea it is serious business here go for the signature brew called colony tea a custom blend of black and white sumatran tea leaves from tea bone zen mind that is soothing without any bitter or harsh tang the most unique aspect is the addition of flavored syrup such as french rose ginger lavender palm and cinnamon pandan and pineapple to enhance the tea they work to tease out the nuances of the tea and create a therapeutic experience as one slowly sips along with the light bites available daily except sundays this afternoon tea also comes with a glass of moet chandon brut imperial champagne indeed colony does not only set itself apart from other local high tea by virtue of its nostalgic charm the quality of food and tea are highly accomplished as well if you favour both substance and style this would fit the bill\",\"this hit the spot and you can find many of them sprawled around singapore it was great for an afternoon tea coffee break while also substituting as a rest stop for some ac in the hot singapore weather i recommend the usual kaya toast with pandan and butter as well as a an iced coffee or kopi it is made with condensed milk and not your usual iced coffee here but it is the right amount of sweetnedd without being overwhelming this chain has been around for years and i cannot complain i think the only thing that could make it better was more butter on the bread\",\"something to try if you want a simple meal especially breakfast in singapore get the kaya toast with butter set and make sure to dunk that toast in the eggs drink it down with some delicious coffee is it a life changing meal no but it just hits the spot and is extremely cheap\",\"ya kun has dozens of outlets in singapore but this is the original location it was conveniently located near our hotel in chinatown and was a great way to start the morning it was his first time in singapore and we shared one order of kaya toast eggs and tea it was not a bad way to spend a few dollars\",\"ya kun is a local breakfast store good speed and highly recommend for first time travellers\",\"despite the many recommendations that came to us from friends to try this place when visiting singapore it had just an average impression on us food kaya toast   it is just toast with their famous spread butter while it is definitely unique taste wise it was just ok soft boiled eggs   i am a huge fan of eggs and was excited for this but this also was just ok service is quick and fast be prepared to pay as soon as your food comes out that is just the way they roll here while i would still recommend newcomers to singapore to try this place when visiting i would say it is a one time visit spot only\",\"it is hard to miss ya kun kaya they are everywhere in singapore this particular joint is located near far east square a much bigger venue than the other ya kun kaya outlets plus point that they are open at   am to have your early breakfast in solitude their menu is simple it is all about toast coffee tea soft boiled eggs but those three things have served me well i got the savory chasu toast and the durian kaya toast the chasu toast was quite flavorful but the durian kaya toast won a sweet spot in my heart perfectly toasted crisp bread sandwiching the rich and creamy durian paste added with kaya and butter delicious and they smell so good sniff sniff p service was not exactly friendly but at least they are speedy and efficient overall ya kun kaya toast is an awesome spot to get your quick breakfast fix i will most definitely be back\",\"really good kaya toast and coffee it is a bit strange with the whole paying and ordering system first you sit down someone comes and takes your order then your drink will come out first and you pay when your toast gets here and the lady tells you the amount in our case we order two sets of toasts so she asked for the money when my first toast got to the table and asked us to pay again when my second toast arrived until i gave her a weird look and she said you paid i said yes you collected the money two minutes ago be careful of their inefficient system\",\"a classic establishment in singapore would go for the famous kaya toast which is surprisingly good considering how simple the dish is their kaya paste is not too sweet and has a good sticky texture the bread is toasted well and the butter adds to the decadence creaminess the traditional coffee tea kopi teh are ok you can find better ones elsewhere\",\"i wanted in on this kaya business as i saw references to it everywhere asked my friend km what it actually was just toast with asiany brioche like bread with a slather of coconut jam atop liked so much i ordered it again at terminal  in changi where there is also a little first floor kiosk\",\"this place was closed for  days for chinese new year but finally opened on last day of our singapore trip had to try the traditional breakfast this place has interesting history that you can read about while waiting in the queue once we ordered the food came out fairly quickly it is a family business and the service was excellent the coffee was amazing and made the old fashion way w a sock order one of the kaya value sets and you cannot go wrong great prices too would highly recommend this place for traditional kaya toast\",\"put down that nasty free hostel breakfast and go spend the  sgd on breakfast here gotta eat kaya toast when in sing it is their version of dessert for breakfast this is the orig so skip all the makeup and go sweat it out at breakfast the sweetened iced coffee is strong and delicious runny eggs you should mix a little with soy sauce and salt yum as others suggested bring wet wipes kaya will glue to your fingers and sing is a land of byot tissue wherever you go staff is so very friendly but when the boss lady walks around to collect before you eat better pay up quick\",\"although this place is a chain i am still a big fan of this classic singaporean breakfast chain the usual kaya toast with butter and soft boiled eggs and iced milo is the winning combo my boyfriend and i walked into this place on one morning and got told that the hot drinks maker was down but singapore is always warm anyway so why get the hot drinks we were however puzzled on how on earth the soft boiled eggs would be consumed but the instinct took over and we soon munched the toast dipped in egg like a local would service is neither friendly nor rude just the usual efficiency you see in singapore and i was at least being grateful to be greeted in english and not chinese as everyone in chinatown assumed that i could speak mandarin in which i could not i would still go to this place again if i am nearby but for now a jar of kaya jam bought from singapore should do the trick when i am at home in copenhagen it wo not be the same but at least i did not have to endure the  hour flight\",\"wow amazing it is so simple but so good kaya is the coconut jam that is spread onto the toast then they also put a sliced of butter in the middle i love how it is dipped into the soft boiled egg the whole combination is quite unique do not forget to add the sweet soy sauce into the egg this is a popular shop with numerous franchises all over town i find this location is decor to stand out more than ones you find at the malls so come to this shop it is also in a nice area with other restaurants because this is obviously just an appetizer\",\"i actually did not go to this location but i could not find a yelp page for the location that i did go to it was in some mall that is connected to my hotel so i am just going to post my review here loli came to ya kun kaya toast for breakfast and ordered the kaya butter toast set  which came with a coffee and runny eggs the coffee was good but it did not taste that out of the ordinary i have a really weak stomach when it comes to runny eggs and these eggs were superrrrr runny so i did not eat them and cannot comment on how good it is but the kaya toast omg so good i will admit that i felt a little sick afterwards because of how buttery and sweet it was but it was so worth it the jam that they put in it was heaven highly recommend a visit if you are in singapore\",\"starbucks singapore style style there are are several of these in singapore they do coffee soft boiled eggs and toast with butter and kaya coconut jam comfort food my only gripe is they have too much butter and not enough jam on their toast\",\"my friend highly recommended the coconut jam here and told us to save room after dinner to try their toast good thing we walked around before trying this place out and glad i had extra room to stuff this down my husband had a small cup of coffee he said it was too sweet for him i personally did not try this so i cannot comment on that hes also the type of person who drinks coffee black with no sugar or creams their ya kun kaya toast omg i just have to say i have never had anything like this before super delicious where it wasnt super sweet and just the right amount of jam to make me want to finosh my toast even if i was full from dinner pleaseeee open in the us i saw they had multiple locations around asia but non in the us im going to be sad once my jar runs out of jam soooo delicious once you try it youre gonna wanna bring a ton back home\",\"love ya kun kaya this was our first ever bite of kaya toast we came here for breakfast one morning before exploring s pore is clarke quay and chinatown areas this is the original yk location and it automatically feels authentic and historic this location has the most seating out of all the other yk locations we visited there is outside seating as well as fans equipped inside tables we the set of kaya toast and sugar kaya toast with iced coffee tea and soft boiled eggs holy smokes we have never had kaya toast or traditional singaporean brekkie before and our minds were blown i still salivate a little thinking about that delicious savory runny and sweet crunchy combo pandan is what makes up a lot of the kaya spread and by golly it is amazing the servers here all speak flawless english and mandarin as well as other languages bosses the service was amazingly quick and efficient and their menus are easy to navigate so fret not foreigners shoutout to the amazing staff we were tourists totally soaking up the atmosphere and delicious food but we also saw lots of locals eating here from families to single customers\",\"classic singaporean breakfast that you have to try the toast on its own is really sweet but the key to enjoying it is to add soy sauce to the liquid eggs mix it up and then dunk the toast into the egg mixture making sure it is well coated do not be afraid to scoop more on top the cold drinks were good as well\",\"quintessential singaporean breakfast kaya toast runny eggs and coffee well i do not drink coffee so i had tea with milk and sugar instead a really nice man asked me if i was eating there or for takeaway and when i said it was for there he told me to take a seat anywhere and then brought over a menu i got the above mentioned breakfast set which was set a there was a set b c and d which had different kinds of kaya toast i remember set d was a kaya peanut butter toast which also sounded amazing the kaya butter toast was pretty delicious the bread is very toasted and crispy at one point the nice old man sat down with me and showed me how to properly eat kaya toast he asked to put soy sauce and some black pepper into my runny eggs then i mixed it and he told me to dip my toast into the runny egg soy sauce mixture really tasty great hearty way to start the day\",\"this review is for the coffee only the black coffee with the condense milk has a very bold flavor but is easy to drink wish this was available in the usa so good\",\"i am obsessed kaya toast became an obsession in singapore and i ate it every morning for the duration i was in singapore this place is super local and super cheap the staff here is super warm and friendly they explained how to eat the kaya toast to me here although i had been warned and watched youtube videos on how to do but i appreciated the friendliness i went a little bit after it opened and there were quite a few customers already lots of people that were definitely regulars as the person at the register knew their orders the food came out quickly and the ordering process is really swift definitely always get the soft boiled eggs with the kaya toast it is everything i wish they had places with real kaya toast in the us\",\"i came here after reading all the great reviews but was a bit disappointed tbh i wanted to start my day with authentic singaporean breakfast kaya toast and eggs with kopi and hence got here the food was good but the place was too small and cramped service was bad and staff was unfriendly you need to first wait to be seated then note your table number and then go to the counter to place the order you need to mention the table number when you place your order and they will bring the food to your table we were seated in a table and once i went to the counter to place the order they moved my family over to a different table i had to go back and change the order again to update the table number also they do not provide you napkins so make sure you get your own or have a back up plan portions were very small and even though i placed  orders of the breakfast they brought all the food in one plate i had to then ask them to get us additional plates bowls utensils since  of us would be eating what were they thinking food was good but there are many other places with much better service and much better food and portions i would skip this one and find a better place\",\"if you are looking for something local and fast this is the place to come we came in at  right before a crowd came in so we had no trouble finding a table the servers are kind and attentive i am giving them three stars because the food was okay we ordered the bread toast laksa and nasi lemak with otah for drinks we ordered the organic chinese tea and the coffee with milk\",\"this place became our daily morning ritual on our trip to singapore for some reason we were up by am almost everyday and with waking up came the hunger a quick search in yelp showed this place open it close to our hotel so that was a plus as well and so we went the food was great it was tasty and inexpensive the place was clean enough my only gripe is that they do not give you any napkins i noticed a lot of places here do not so if you are messy eater like myself bring some on your own other than that our experience here was more than satisfactory it fed us when we were hungry at an odd time in the morning it was tasty cheap and clean enough the chicken curry was easily the best dish would definitely recommend\",\"delicious curry chicken rice for   the curry rice come with thick fragrant gravy with a lot of potatoes and meat fast serving and big portion definitely will return for lunch\",\"i did not know such old school kopitiam still exists today and right in the heart of orchard road at that i was having a post wedding staycation at lloyd is inn and the stay includes a breakfast set at this place we came late and coincided with the lunch crowd who were mainly there for some after lunch coffee tea we ordered the simple toast set french toast set which was simple and yet so filling my french toast set had egg mixed in with the bread and layered on top with kaya and a slice of butter on the side it reminded me of my primary school days breakfast that my grandma made for me i vow to recreate this at home next time i also ordered the ginger tea sans milk and it was very hot in my tummy and strong good for removing excess wind in the stomach will certainly drop by this place again if i am craving some good ole toast and coffee tea a tip is to come here before or after the lunch crowd say before pm or from pm onwards\",\"delicious local breakfast my husband was doubting me but he def enjoyed it we got kopi kaya toast and soft boiled eggs it is a quick breakfast that gets you in and out mostly locals order than find a seat it gets busy\",\"yes yes and more yes simplest breakfast foods ever but so good that i had it twice during my stay in singapore kaya toast soft boiled eggs and soy milk with grass jelly cost no more than  sgd walk up to the counter order pay sit down and out comes to the food nothing fancy just plain and simple this place is an institution and has a lot of history to it great to visit and to try especially how cheap it is this one is also the original in singapore so def visit consider also getting a jar of the kaya spread you can even try to make it yourself at home i did\",\"great little spot i came with a full stomach but needed to try the kaya toast it was simple  pieces of bread with kaya spread and slices of butter but it was packed with flavor move over nutella toast because kaya toast got you beat definitely get the soya milk with grass jelly to wash it down with the humid weather in singapore this drink is more than refreshing\",\"i wanted a taste to see what a typical singaporean breakfast would be like this place was really packed in the morning i ordered two types of sweet toast and some fried noodle rolls everything was super sweet it was definitely unique and worth a try especially if you are a tourist\",\"hands down the best traditional s pore breakfast i have had during my week here the first kaya breakfast i had in my life was at the big chain ya kun kaya toast you can see it in the food levels of singapore is many malls around the city or like we also did visit the original location on china street in between telok ayer and chinatown but killiney is original location on killiney road a little walk is away from somerset was just as quaint and much more delicious in my opinion their system of ordering is at the cashier once you have found a table you cannot order items unless you can provide a table number so if you are with a buddy have them take over a table while someone else puts the orders in major key we had their soft boiled eggs and kaya toast mee cheong mee siam and iced tea coffee we ate like kings for about   i believe i do not remember the actual amount but it should be around that price pretty great for singapore my favorite was their kaya toast so much thicker and still crisp compared to ya kun is and their spread was less sugary like ya kun does it i even bought a jar of kaya spread to take home to the states i loved it that much kaya is essentially pandan coconut milk eggs and sugar i cannot wait to use it on my toast at home their iced tea was so good not overly sweet like at ya kun and definitely freshly made with fresh foam on top of my cup we were so excited about our first order that at the end i put in an order for mee siam after looking around their shop at the photos that was not my favorite item but the egg was cooked to perfection and the sauce was a hint spicy with lots of flavor service is quick and their workers are all bosses at efficient food running and order taking hats off\",\"stopped by here one morning to have breakfast during my visit to singapore it was not a great experience it was a combination of language barrier overly spicy food for breakfast and a jam packed interior most of what we ordered was not available their boiled eggs were essentially raw even after we made a request for done eggs not coming back to this particular one for sure\",\"the kopi i miss it so much i love that it is piping hot chocolatey rich supremely strong yet smoothly moves through your mouth like silk i love that you can buy a package of their coffee i had the curry and it was excellent a weird mix with a cuppa coffee but who cares minusone star for the lack of air conditioning\",\"open seating and it is always full in the mornings we went there on a sunday morning around am and it was packed come am and there is a few vacant tables already food is simple yet good i had the soft boiled eggs with kaya toast hot coffee and iced tea really good you can also buy their kaya jam jar to take home\",\"honey ginger tea they use real ginger and the tea is strong and soothing for  it is a pretty good dealit is cash only\",\"we stumble upon this amazing breakfast place i have never had kaya toast and wanted to try omg it was so good also i ordered the ginger milk tea amazing and the laksa noodles i was super impressed with everything and will head back before i leave tomorrow\",\"from the regent hotel the walk is about   minutes arrived at around  am jet lagged and a hungry early bird looking for a worm this place did the job had the coffee with sweetened condensed milk very sweet and strong also had and loved the soft boiled egg and an order of french toast both very good the system is simple here you pay first and they deliver your food to you was disappointed that the laksa was not available but i think it is only a lunch item here i enjoyed the random jokes and philosophical tidbits scattered about the cool white walls for some reason i enjoyed the cool intensely white lit interior of the establishment normally this kind of vibe gives me a migraine especially in the morning but it worked here for some reason i tried a couple of the malay dishes but did not like them as thought they were too sweet i ate them quickly only as a matter if formality will finish with the insightful philosophical message posted on a sign on the wall here that put my morning in perspective teens you have all the time and energy but no money workers you have the money and energy but no time oldies you have all the time and money but no more energy lesson enjoy life and all the things you have at the moment because you cannot have everything at once\",\"killiney kopitiam is a great place for a fast meal snack it is in every way a kopitiam with stools and rough tables and nothing much the atmosphere is noisy order and pre pay your food about the only service is when they serve the food this is not a criticism the food is good and reasonably priced for singapore we liked the chicken curry cheong fan french toast with kaya bread roll with kaya chendol and kopi if you are visiting the area try it it still has the character of yesteryears my only fault with the place is it is not wheel chair friendly there is a step down from the adjoining shops and from the  foot path\",\"my mom found this place thru a guidebook in japanese and decided to try it we ordered kaya butter toast and it was delicious i could eat a dozen of them we never got to try any other item but maybe next time the place is very small and very crowded so you gotta hover around the tables there is no waiting list for the tables you just gotta grab it we later found out that there is another location at the airport so you can try their kaya toast without making your way all the way to this location\",\"delicious kaya toast and french bread the egg was nice and runny perfect for dipping\",\"xiao long bao in my opinion better than din tai fung and cheaper  for   the xlb are tasty and soupy made fresh in front of you and served steaming hot i appreciate the simplicity of the ingredients yet the complexity of the flavors such a simple dish but so tasty i will definitely be back others were also ordering the szechuan dumplings or wonton which looked really good too\",\"i walked into the smith street chinatown food court fully expecting the highlight to be the globally acclaimed hawker chan so you can imagine my surprise when i found they were bested by neighbor zhong guo la mian and their spicy wontons star  how were the service and atmosphere like hawker chan there is almost always a line in front of zhong guo la mian but i was pleased to find on a saturday lunch hour that the wait was less than twenty minutes once you are up front your order comes out in no more than five minutes star star  how were the portions relative to the cost  sgd for ten spicy szechuan wontons might have felt a bit more expensive than some of the other stalls but this was at the end of the day a screaming deal given these are made fresh to order essentially right in front of you star stars  and  how was the food these spicy wontons were excellent and my only regret was that i did not also order the xlb you had great filler encased in a smooth skin that really lapped up the spicy chili oil single star star  would you be excited to go back definitely star\",\"been to this restaurant three times now and love the food it is located in the lively smith street of chinatown\",\"food    service    value    decor    overall    everyone wants to be a hipster and that means taking really mediocre food in dingy stalls and talking it up like it is some gift from above lets get real these are at best decent xlb for a hawker stall but even trying to compare these to dtf is absolute fake news the non xlb items are completely mediocre read ugh pass\",\"all in all din tai fung still wins in my opinion as i prefer the flavor of the dtf xiao long bao filling the skin here was somewhat inconsistent and if you were not very delicate and careful it would break letting the soup leak out everything is clearly handmade fresh here though you can see them hard at work in the hawker stall kitchen making each dumpling one by one and steaming the baskets of course these are not as aesthetically pleasing as dtf but if you are looking for soupy dumplings at an affordable price then this is the place for you we also ordered one bowl of beef noodle soup one plate of pan fried dumpling one plate of boiled dumplings and one plate of szechuan spicy wonton for a group of six the total was just s pp the beef noodle soup was very delicious and i would definitely order that on its own again the pan fried and boiled dumplings were excellent as well the pan fried is probably more unique and requires more effort to cook also more unhealthy the szechuan wonton is a unique flavor of vinegar and spicy oil and it is not for everyone it might be an acquired taste but none of us foreigners were really a big fan of the szechuan spiciness with vinegar\",\"in terms of hawker xlb this would be one of the good ones i still think the soup should be more oily and sticky the skin is correct i suppose so far din tai fung will be the most authentic although a bit too clean in flavor for the price i think you get your money is worth  for\",\"kreta ayer market is just a labyrinth on the second floor chocked full of food gems to be discovered one such example zhong guo la mian xiao long bao as in the namesake you should get an order of the xiao long baos at  for  they are a good deal and while a little less refined than the ones from din tai fung these feel more homely and very satisfying the soup dumplings are really juicy and the broth has good flavor they often make the dumplings to order so there might a be a little wait as they prepare the dumplings and place them right into the steamer it is totally worth it though\",\"best xlb in singapore is found at zhong guo la mian xiao long bao in chinatown  the steamed mini buns basically pork dumplings but the fat from pork melts out of the meat into the bun and is kinda soupy in the buns oh my god so good illeatforyou xlb\",\"the only place i have ever tried xlb was at din tai fung in seattle even though others love it i never thought it was that good and just assumed xlb was supposed to be that way my views on xlb changed after going to zhong guo la mian for about   usd you get  amazingly juicy and perfectly steamed xlb that packs so much amazing flavor that you will crave for months if i can find a way back to singapore this spot is a must stop\",\"wildly delicious and exceptionally convenient xlbs will be the end of me i will move into the chinatown complex and find refuge with zhong guo la mian xiao long bao there is something uniquely satisfying about eating dumplings prepared before your eyes it is nostalgic a taste of innocence one bite and they will have you they will own your time and your wallet while i am reluctant to admit this kind of uncouth behavior i can devour  dumplings in one sitting\",\"it is not bad but i dont think it is gonna win any awards soon i ordered the szechuan spicy noodles and pan fried dumplings you cant order half portion for the dumplings so it is all or nothing the dumplings are good but i have had better but for hawker centre standards   the noodles has a peanut sauce base but it was lacking in dimensions about   not a big fan but it was decent i was just too lazy to queue for the other award winning stalls i will come back to try their xiao long bao next time\",\"good solid xlb that can satisfy any craving with the additional delight of having paid just   for  dumplings found this on yelp and no regrets about trying it i am a huge xlb fan used to go to the crystal jade steamboat and xlb buffet for both the steamboat and the free flow xlb i have just returned from taipei where i tried the original din tai fung my conclusion this is comparable with dtf quality xlb in singapore for a better price point the skin is paper thin without being overly soft or breakable and the soup folded inside the dumplings is tasty and steaming hot we thought that the filling is more generous than dtf or other places in general and the dumpling are similar sized and similar tasting the dumplings are also made to order which means you have to line up for a longer time as you wait for it to steam or pan fry if you order guo tie but so very worth it obviously it is in a hawker center so the atmosphere is nothing special to speak of but it is great for a no frills meal it makes me sad to think that something so simple and so good and so cheap cannot be found easily in the us p s i gotta try this good beer company everyone is mentioning p p p s the store is   for those struggling to find it as i did it is near the edge of the complex and across from hong kong soy sauce chicken store of michelin fame\",\"this place does different types of dumplings and some noodles as well i sampled the dumplings and they are pretty decent not that they are amazing in any way but the pan fried dumplings are good and  for   sgd is a good deal the line was not long when i was there but there was a constant flow of people going here and for the price it would be a place i could consider returning to\",\"i have eaten at this establishment a few times now and usually i just walk up to the counter and order a batch of freshly made xiao long baos but today was a good  minutes wait not that i am complaining it was totally worth it the wait actually allowed me to watch how the guy makes his tasty little packets of love so i am not a big fan of xlb that are very soupy i know i know do not lynch me it is just my preference and do not get me started on those tang baos but do not get me wrong the meat filling is not dry by any means i find them to be full of balanced flavor between pork and flour skin for a little variety try them in different combination of sauces soy or vinegar only and mixed and with without ginger try with ketchup ok just kidding the other nice thing is the reasonable price of    pieces come on great taste for a great price go give this place a try\",\"we had to come here twice because the first time they were not open it was pm so make sure to not come then the second time we came at pm and they were open for business i ordered the xlb and spicy pork dumplings both were super delicious the couple owners were so nice and helpful too they made me feel very welcomed at their food stand\",\"i cheer for the underdogs well  of the time only because  seriously should stay that way i typically spit at the favored ones well nearly  of the time because they tend to get over hyped to the point that making small mistakes become so unforgivable after all the endless banter causes your brain to think they are perfect because of how they are marketed right this probably explains my utter distaste towards din tai feng especially the two overcrowded spots in la that supposedly has the best dumplings in the freaking area do not get me wrong they are decent quite good at best but nothing mind blowing so when people keep saying that din tai feng is the only to go spot for good dumplings bile begins to form in my mouth fast forward to zhong guo la mian xiao long bao you will find two very friendly and hardworking prcs wanted to say chinese guys but changed it prc to purposely address the current stereotype and say these guys are freaking awesome they should be culinary ambassadors kneading dough and forming xiao long baos hereafter xlbs one after the other with their magical fingers they do not even need to boast awesomeness and screw themselves up with a swollen reputation because witnessing them furiously at work to keep up with the line is enough indication that they are now one of two main reasons for visiting chinatown complex the other being the good beer company and having their xlb on several occasions after cindy q introduced it to our little gathering i can safely say that  for  xlbs that taste great and pairs well with strong beers is woohoo as good as it gets definitely recommendnote i have had it  times so far   each time and the best time is usually dinner after a long line why i went at lunch and my  xlbs came from the chiller and the dough was a bit dry and chewy compared to the ones i have had during dinner where it goes straight to the steamer freshly made yelp\",\"ya if they were open so disappointing that i had to settle for hawker chan but it should be a good alternative yelp did not show that this is closed though hope to try it again soon but for now is  star\",\"i can confirm the other reviews are accurate great dumplings cheap worth a trip\",\"for  whether it be xiao long bao guo tie boiled dumplings or steamed ones i was meeting jireh h and amanda l for a drink at good beer company i was early and craving dumplings decided to walkabout to survey the offerings started seeing many tables had big bamboo steamers on them finally found the dumpling shop run by  cheery china guys i started with an order of boiled dumplings once the others took a taste they started really getting into it we ended up ordering a few more lots of xiao long baos and an order of guo tie the xiao long bao has a certain sweetness to it i think it is chinese wine these and the pot stickers guo tie seemed to be the most popular ones when we were waiting for our orders i prefer the xiao long bao and boiled dumplings to the pot stickers as i find the stickers a bit heavy because of the oil from frying the dumplings are already quite resplendent with meat juices inside people were ordering dumplings to takeaway in multiple boxes i give  stars not because these are the best i have ever had but they are very yummy with a bit of a unique taste and well worth the price there is also not much of a wait despite them being made up on the spot you can see the guys rolling the dough and filling them while waiting free entertainment\",\"after an hour into waiting in line for one of two michelin star food stalls hong kong soya sauce chicken rice noodle we decided to pick up some soup dumplings to tie us over the dumplings were fresh they actually make them in front of you juicy and the skin wrapper was delicate and thin these were better than any that i have had at din tai fung or any other soup dumpling restaurant and it was only  for  definitely worth checking out while you are in chinatown\",\"odette is an absolute experience while we were here for the formula  race we actually may have been just as excited to eat at odette there were a number of fantastic dishes we had during our meal but the ones that stood out to me was the soft boiled egg dish and the quail presentation i absolutely love the location of the restaurant and the decor the ceiling was beautiful service was delightful and i loved being able to peer into the kitchen getting a reservation is definitely a challenge here so if you know you are going to be in singapore immediately start hunting down the date for when reservations are released i would definitely love to come back here if we are ever in singapore again\",\"after my meal at odette i am convinced that the michelin inspectors in singapore are far too generous with their stars  michelin stars laughable noma and n naka are both  stars and those meals were exceedingly more impressive and memorable odette simply is not even in the same league we are talking about a french restaurant being ranked as the best restaurant in asia by an organization that has gotten some well deserved flack for its award categories i mean can everyone see what is wrong with that statement but hey i was curious to try it so before my holiday i booked a lunch reservation here and off we went the foodwe had another michelin meal at labyrinth scheduled for dinner that same day so we wanted to do a lighter lunch at odette we ended up going with the  course menu which was plenty as the courses were punctuated with additional courses i also decided to try the truffle egg as an additional add on amuse bouche consisted of  small bites out of which only the cheese stick came across as unique if a little under seasoned not the strongest start to our meal bread the temperature was pleasantly warm who likes eating cold bread right and the spread and dip made for good pairings the truffle bread was especially good mushroom tea served with bread this was perhaps the only course i felt like was genuinely delicious the tea was savory and offered crunchy bits of textural contrast truffle egg just pass on this if you have had black truffles then you have surely already had this disappointing experience very underwhelming and overpriced for what you get the normal non truffled egg course was superior in my opinion chicken what a boring protein choice and it tasted that way too everything about this dish from the sauce to the vegetable medley to the texture and flavor of the chicken were totally forgettable the only thing that was even sort of exciting was the side of flavored rice crab covered in a gel layer this dish was probably the most obvious display of their use of molecular gastronomy the entire thing looked like an alien swimming through space finished with microgreen accents in terms of taste and temperature it was not that exciting desserts lunch ended with several of these including a stack of petit fours of which the lollipops were the most interesting and the caneles were the least the servicepacing was fine for a  course meal and i never had to ask for a water refill the experiencea couple things  for a  star restaurant i was really surprised and honestly pretty irritated about the lack of attention to detail when it came to our check i understand that this is singapore and what is more it is a french restaurant in singapore and so there may be certain traditional cultural expectations that the man pays the bill however this is  and making that kind of assumption when you place the check down on the table is not as safe as it once was in the s oh my gosh a woman paying how unthinkable now the reasonable expectation for a restaurant of this supposed caliber should be to take notice of a who put the card down and b what the name on the card is which should not matter if they would pay attention to the former when the card was returned to us it went straight back to my male dining partner instead of to me when i am the one who paid what a bunch of crap seriously this is one of my biggest pet peeves especially at michelin restaurants just put the goddamn check in the middle of the table and return it to the person who actually paid  no keepsake perhaps it was just because we had the  course lunch menu but i have become accustomed to receiving some kind of keepsake menu or takeaway treat after a meal like this i have gotten keepsakes at michelin restaurants that cost less you have got  michelin stars step up your experience game overallfrom the outside odette looks modern and airy and pretty with its pale pinks and gold accents and white tablecloths which by the way i thought they would at least do away with considering how modern they are but i suppose that particular french tradition will continue to live on here maybe for grandma odette but food wise it was slightly underwhelming and experience wise it did not feel like they were at the top of their game best restaurant in asia methinks not\",\"odette is located inside the singapore national gallery so it is kind of cool to be there after hours at night there are a few other restaurants around it as well though i would not usually go for a french menu in an asian country i had read good things about odette so we decided to come here reservations are accepted  days in advance online so if you want a friday or saturday dinner you should plan ahead we did dinner on a friday night the menu comes as  acts for  sgd about  usd which is not that outrageous if you look at the price for  michelin star places in sf and ny these days they also have a shorter lunch option available canaps tartlet with white chocolate and px vinegar gougeres a unique long shape with tomato sweet shrimp with cumin herbs and avocado on a crisp amuse mushroom tea cep sabayon winter buckwheat and walnuts mushroom tea cep mushroom brioche with truffle butter bread service with salted whipped butter with buckwheat and extra virgin olive oil from catalonia baguette sourdough truffle

coordinated setting of dishes etc though i would expect no less for  stars overall everything was solid and it was a great special occasion meal but nothing was super innovative or particularly standout for us\",\"best restaurant in asia is a title which carries a lot of weight lunch at odette was certainly very good but maybe my expectations were too high my friend and i had the  course lunch we were lucky enough to be able to book around  weeks in advance the reservation process was pleasant they ask for a deposit and a confirmation i was a bit confused why they asked for another confirmation once seemed enough for me especially considering the cancellation policy of taking your deposit if you are a no show nevertheless service wise i have nothing to complain all staff was extremely attentive and friendly despite the fact that the restaurant was filled with fellow chefs and food critics we were there during the world is best  event foodwise it was also excellent i felt like all dishes had a clear focus was extremely balanced and highlighted the ingredients my faves were definitely the rosemary smoked egg and the red mullet especially the smoked egg with the potato tasted like my favorite comfort food mash with a soft boiled egg elevated to michelin status so overall great food and excellent service so why no five stars i do not think it compares with the former greatness of andre i think odette does classics to perfection but lacks innovation if i read some of the older reviews i have noticed that the dishes stayed more or less the same over the years a restaurant in this league should lead innovation but hey if mr michelin and mr world is best  disagree with me i might be wrong or maybe it is personal preference i will definitely want to go and try the dinner offer and see if they can convince me to add that th yelp star\",\"while vacationing in singapore we dined at this fantastic restaurant supposedly no  restaurat in asia and it was recently awarded  star michelin so far it is the best restaurant we have been so far the food service location inside a museum ambiance was what you expect at  star michelin and the  restaurant in asia just awesome highly recommended it will cost you this is not for budget conscious foodie\",\"oddette is probably in the top  best meals i have had in my life i want to say top  with tickets and akelarre as some other meals in that tier for me i felt like the value of ambiance service and food was fairly matched by the cost of the meal we went on a weekend so they only offered  course or  course for lunch and originally we wanted to do the  course they offer for lunch on weekdays but it is hard to get a reservation here so we took whatever they could offer if you want to try this restaurant on a budget go for lunch on a weekday and they will serve a s   course menu caution though when you are budgeting for this meal it is both on a financial and time dimension this certainly is not your one hour lunch and not even your  hour lunch it took us  and a half hours when they say  courses what they mean is like  real dishes and they do not include the transitioning dishes that help cleanse your palate which many restaurants would include as part of the tasting menu overall i think i counted around  dishes dish after dish combined the freshest and highest quality ingredients with beautiful execution the ingredients were from a vast array of cuisines including uni pigeon foie gras caviar truffle scallop shiitake and so much more one note that i have to make is if you set yourself a budget for this meal when they ask if you would like some cheese either a homemade truffle cheese or a cheese tasting it is going to be extra and they do not warn you about it it costs s  extra for the cheese was it worth it we got to taste a lot of different kinds of cheese both in taste and texture however there were maybe only one cheese we really liked ossau iraty so probably not worth the cost all dishes were amazing my favorites would be the hokkaido uni and toast abalone with foie gras rosemary smoked egg and some of the amuse bouche i do not want to ruin any surprises but just sit back and enjoy the composition\",\"odette was a fantastic meal with impeccable service in a wonderful environment each course was evidently well thought through with the beetroot pidgeon and mushroom soup as highlights some of the courses did not quite hit the spot the seaweed cured kinmedai was a bit whatever the yuzu tart was slightly underwhelming the presentation of each though was imaginative and well thought through love was put into every dish overall though we left as very happy diners  is a steep price point incl  glasses wine but odette is a fantastic experience worth splashing out for\",\"yes it is a  star in yelp for a  star restaurant service food ambience and overall experience is comparable to what we paid for we can see the difference between osteria francescana vs odette especially in its service and creativity otherwise all good\",\"odette national gallery singapore michelin starsfrench cuisine by chef julien royer my  course set lunch amuse bouche conte cheese

display but egg was not so hotquercy lamb saddle nicelemon tart very nicelovely lunch not just because it has the stars but it was very good\",\"during our recent trip to singapore we had an opportunity to dine at odette and was the best dining experience for us in singapore the service was impeccable the flavor taste and freshness of all the ingredients were perfect we look forward to trying their other seasonal menu when we return back to singapore next time\",\"this is the very best of singapore dining odette is artful delicious with near perfect service a truly great setting it sits in an elegant ground floor corner of the national gallery singapore should be very proud of this restaurant the restaurant is controlled by the capable hands of the french fine diners know that singapore needs to remove its truly incapable hand from restaurant service when i ask my singaporean friends why they encourage and support such poor service i am told that they do not see being a waiter as a profession well take a closer look it is a demonstration of a lack of pride and poor taste singapore odette stands out as a first class restaurant the  or so courses are all very well executed and if you can afford the price and can wait out the extended calendar for a reservation you must experience this elegant dining\",\"came her for the last meal of our honeymoon and it was a fantastic experience the food was excellent the only dish on our tasting menu that i did not really get into was the foi pho but i do understand how that could be a more palatable presentation for the locals the staff was extremely friendly which is why we ended up being the last ones out of there at the ended of the night the only thing i thought was a little weird was how far it is to the restroom there is probably not much they can do about that\",\"deservedly a  star great ambience and great wine pairing lunch experience definitely try the  course menu\",\"there are just so many things to appreciate about a restaurant like this and how julien royer operates his kitchen whether it was his directive or his investors his strictly local talent is incredible and the imagination is showcased in the dishes is beautiful you can tell every chef and employee works hard yet loves what they do with all of their smiles there is no pretentiousness like i am noticing after the stars have been awarded like in other restaurants where there once was no such thing e q corner house i agree with nik t that odette was always in the shadows of the more adventurous and experimental andre but now that the latter has closed its doors odette truly shines above all other singapore michelin stars the dishes are beautiful and full of flavor as well as many courses with the bells and whistles of dry ice and smoke the ambiance is comfortable but the staff quickly makes you feel at home very conversational and full of knowledge and warmth although this is a typical long tasting menu dinner if there was any in singapore to spend on that is uniquely singapore definitely do odette\",\"excellent menu exhibiting creativity flavours beautiful plating and mastering of techniques the only bmol is certain dishes could have been served slightly warmer not overly long but diverse and very good wine list mainly french one of the best service staff in singapore friendly knowledgeable and pro active in my opinion the best french restaurant in singapore more daring and passionate yet less pretentious than its leading competitors\",\"not quite five stars but a solid four my benchmark for fine dining in sg will always be andre and unfortunately julien has yet to step out of his shadow their space at the national gallery is a class act but not anywhere as panoramic as jaan still you will impress your date if you bring one their delightfully friendly and accommodating service team will further ensure you and yours are well taken care of the pacing of the tasting menu was fine with enough time to take that perfect food porn and with free wifi enabling you to upload instantly to yelp as for the food some dishes the egg the cepe tea and the dessert were just too similar to jaan nothing necessarily wrong but just a tad bit boring for my picky palate the artisan bread selection with unsalted butter prosciutto and lard spread will stave off any hunger pangs and increase serotonin to such levels leading to happiness the heirloom beetroot variation was a standout dish for me i might well turn vegetarian if all non meat dishes taste as such beautiful to both eye and mouth the seafood dishes were also noteworthy fresh simple ingredients assembled with complexity desserts whilst satiating were nothing mind blowing so maybe i will try their cheese supplement next time now lo and behold this is something that grandma odette can be proud of\",\"this restaurant deservingly earned its michelin star the six course menu was creative inviting and delicious it also busted my belly i do not know how people can take down the  course set as with most fine dining do not come here within a budget order with your stomach and not the wallet my one criticism is that there is no dress code a table of grown men came in with backpacks sneakers and shirts which betrays the spirit of fine dining i might be a snob so whatever deal with it\",\"odette is the latest hyped restaurant in singapore and for our wedding anniversary seemed to be a befitting location to celebrate by indulging dinner menus are priced  and  for  or  courses respectively note that the  course dinner is not available from friday and saturday vegetarian menus are available too we took both the normal menus to try upon seating we were asked which type of water we would like still or sparkling  person free flow seemed reasonable tap is available for free though first up were canaps  bite sized delights all quite tasty sorry cannot remember the details followed by amuse bouche of mushroom tea this was good full of umami though that a half piece of brioche as a chaser was unnecessary in my view then the bread platter arrived a piece of tree bark was used in place of a plate presentation was great  different types of bread were served chia seed focaccia was our favorite but the sourdough wedge was lovely too the thyme brioche was the weakest link the flavor was not intense enough to make any impact two different butters were served salted lardo yes it is piggy fat and unsalted butter then the meal was served proper i sha not go into details of each plate but they were all well presented and tasty but i would not say it is overwhelming impressive especially if they are aiming for the michelin star service was choppy my glass of water was empty for a good while before it was noticed and topped up most of the servers are foreigners and cannot enunciate their words properly dinner ended with petit fours the lemon meringue lollipop was the most interesting and best of the lot canele was a close second though a good experience overall but i wo not be in a hurry to come back maybe for the less pricy lunch but not otherwise\",\"went there in mid aug for a friend is birthday celebration so this review is rather late but i have been missing their food ever since and am planning to go there again there are many great restaurants in singapore but very few are delivering an innovative degustation menu like odette we had the six courses tasting menu fell in love with the rosemary smoked organic egg immediately when we saw the presentation experimental and full of surprises the service is impeccable and the ambience makes people feel relaxed and calm so i say definitely go try it out and you will not regret\",\"odette has probably been the most talked about restaurant in town for the last few months the limited number of tables available and the fairly egalitarian reservation policy is a big factor though some would say julien is the biggest pull and who does not want to see the insides of the supreme court anyway the wait time for a table on the weekend now stands at about   months though cancellations do happen so i recommend calling up the hostess to leave your number fine dining restaurants usually have a money table and another for last minute special people but this does not exist at odette which i found out after several people came back to me empty handed so was it worth the wait i think the restaurant has a lot of potential and i thoroughly enjoyed my lunch but i did not walk away with my mind blown so the answer is i guess so there are clear signs of greatness in the attention to detail in plating picturesque dishes the variety of flavors and textures and some theatrical sauce pouring and smoke the price point is incredible value as well at  for  creative courses plus i love the design of the restaurant it makes one feel calm uncluttered and chic i liked my amuse bouche pork belly and bread do not laugh the restaurants that ace bread making tend to make great food too but i was also bored by the play it safe ingredient list truffles in every other fish check pork belly check foie gras check given how well the dishes were executed why not be adventurous with the produce i have heard the french are as nose to tail happy as chinese to some degree after all there lies the problem i suppose i did not think any dish was bad but i did not find anything so unique or memorable that i could recall its name or contents a week later yes i was with a work related acquaintance and so my mind was not  focused on the food but i tried per se in a similar context and could still remember the piece of srf slow cooked beef i had that melted in my mouth the famous pearls and the insane ending line up of desserts i will end by saying that i am still tempted to return to try the dinner degustation because the chefs could have been limited by the affordable price point required at lunchtime in a way i think the food at odette is like a straight a student at the psle exams schooled in good techniques and scoring points but needs to use that to express some real creativity and risk to achieve greatness let is see what happens\",\"wow oh wow i highly recommend this place the food is good but the service here is something to come for alone in their waiting area you can get your nails done free of charge play area for the kids computer for use and a few other things to keep yourself entertained after we were seated at our table we had an ipad that we can order our food we got aprons to keep our clothes clean from the hot pot and i got a hair tie to keep my hair up from getting in the way after we were served our food our server comes and help to cook our food at our table we ordered the hand pulled noodles so someone came to our table to do it right at our table it was pretty cool there is a sauce bar with a wide selection of ingredients to make our own sauces we made our own but server came by and prepared one of their signature dipping sauce for us as well it was perfect it great with everything such as the meat veggies and seafood i loved everything about this place that is some great service we are not accustomed to this type service at a shabu shabu restaurant most are usually laid back and self service on most things after raving about this restaurant to a few friends i found out that this place is a chain so when i travel i can have this same experience i cannot wait until i can go back\",\"famous chinese hotpot chain usually super long line so would recommend making a reservation good service they offer you ziploc bags to put your phone aprons hair ties for the ladies phone charger and games snacks juices if you are waiting for your table food wise a pretty good selection of soup bases though the meat choice was a bit limited overall a pretty good experience though personally prefer beauty in the pot which has more interesting meat seafood selection and slightly less spicy mala soup the latter is personal preference o sauces and desserts are free buffet styleo would recommend as a meet up spot for a large group\",\"first restaurant after landing in singapore as a good friend recommended first thoughts wow it is so clean we ordered a whole bunch of food including their signature beef and chose chicken soup and spicy sichuan soup as the soup bases food was   and the service we received was   even gave us free deep fried mochi like w honey dessert after finding out that we were on our honeymoon thank you for giving us a great experience\",\"this place was very good it is unfortunate that it is not all you can eat because this is a big selling point to me since many other hot pot places i go to are all you can eat they had a variety of meats and veggies but if you like to have a variety of dishes to try like me i think you will find this place a bit pricey they had your typical meats mushrooms and green vegetables to offer but what stood out to me was the hand pulled noodles that you can order and someone will come out to make them for you right before your eyes it is very entertaining and worth the cost in my opinion this was honestly a normal hot pot place like any other one i have been too but what stood out to me the most and the reason i am giving this  stars is because of the service the service was go good and made my experience complete and positive our waitress was so friendly and would constantly check up on us to see if we needed anything our drinks would get refilled without question throughout the night at no additional cost we each received an apron to not dirty our clothes and i received a hair tie to hold my hair back from the soup we got plastic bags to put our phones in so they do not get dirty quick service we got the food so fast make reservations to be seated quicker but if you choose to wait they give you snacks and manicures they even have a day care area so the kids can play\",\"oh my goodness what a total food experience to be had at this restaurant i do not have any back ground on these hot pots but it was really a very modern take on the old traditional steam boat i think as first timers to this way of cooking at the table our dedicated staff member was amazingly supportive and helpful aprons were supplied along with many hot hand towels as we put together our soups a noodle making demonstration at our table was novel entertainment the evening was extremely enjoyable especially as we shared the room with some australians who also had never been there before ipads took our orders with the help of the staff we just loved the whole evening\",\"fun experience and great fun locationgood selection of meats and brothscool experience and great servicecons famous spicy and other broths too salty and not that awesomemeat cuts are simple american meatsprices high even by singapore standardsfun to try once but not something worth becoming regular over\",\"i have long accepted that good service in singapore is an afterthought at best but hai di lao hot pot has restored my faith that some businesses truly do put the customer first it is pricier than the average hotpot but the service is truly just on point they are supper attentive and the commitment to the smallest of details is truly remarkable anything from little plastic covers for your phone to remembering which tea you were drinking my favorite example of the night was when they offered to tame the spice of our mala broth after they happened to walk by and heard an off the cuff comment from me about my numb lips great little side dishes while you wait plus a plethora of options to make your own dipping sauce if in doubt feel free to ask the staff to make the house sauce for you it is really quite yummy definitely order the handmade mashed shrimp and the house dancing noodles are quite entertaining yes a guy comes around to make fresh noodles as he dances and twirls the dough over your heads did not really order the premium meats and did not notice the difference everything was fresh also really like the wintermelon tea that was just the right amount of sweet we had the latest reservation possible at pm and were seated promptly the lines started to build after but there are drinks snacks games and even manicures to pass the time pricy but i was blown away by the charming and attentive service\",\"this place is amazing you get free snacks ice cream and even your nails done while you are waiting for a table the food here is a bit pricey but totally worth it it tastes really good and the service is excellent it is extremely family friendly and your kids even end up getting toys bathrooms are very clean and nice the waitresses are very courteous and helpful the tables have phone charges in them they even have people perform every now and then to entertain the guests pro tip opt in for the liquid buffet and the sauce dessert buffet they are absolutely worth it adds about  p p to your bill\",\"the wait is long   hours and we called ahead and she said they were not busy however the broths are excellent and the food is excellent while waiting there is a ton of people and uncomfortable stools to sit on they have snacks like popcorn tomatoes and various other goodies i signed up for a manicure but we were eating when they were ready for me so i skipped it for the food the pork and corn balls were excellent as were the dumplings everything else was very good but what i expect at hot pot the sauce bar is nice and is  person for two we spent  s since we wanted to try many broths it was s  for those\",\"oh gosh this is my most favourite hangout for steamboat well well when i heard people rave about this hotpot located at the heart of clark quay area i was like hmmm issit really that good i went down to this venue for my birthday celebration and i was wow by the number of people queuing and waiting to be seated this place is always crowded with people and while waiting for your seat you will be served drinks fruits or nuts with no cost at all ladies pls note you can try to have your manicure done while waiting and its totally free of charge sounds good ya this place serve a wide variety range of food and its really really very fresh th service crew is very attentive and they provide you aprons to wear to avoid any spills a ziplock bag for your handphone and lastly if your handphone is low batt they provide charger too you get to place your order via the ipad and the serving is fast tooi love the sauce selection and dipping my food in the sauce i mix simply make it taste wonderful its a good place for friends gathering and the price is slightly on the high side but its worth the money and experience this place is simply deserve  stars but do note the waiting queue could be quite long\",\"the version of hotpot or steamboat as it is called in singapore is different from our local hotpot this is their second outlet after their crazily successful first outlet at clarke quay that is not to say that the wait is any shorter here even if you call ahead to make reservation it is most likely that you would still have to wait the plus point is that the service is great especially given that they are all from china where service is questionable they also have lots of other entertainment while you wait in this outlet you get pedi mani the kids get a ball room to jump in and you also get free flow of popcorns drinks snacks and fruits on to the main course the hotpot i still prefer the steamboat at imperial treasure over this the offering is pretty much similar and the price point is actually lower than at imperial treasure but imperial treasure is a hong kong style steamboat while hdl is a china style steamboat the tastes do come across as such too it is not about one is better than the other it is more which one you prefer hdl cheaper but the taste is not as refined as imperial treasure great service staff though\",\"it was ok nothing really remarkable about the food the sauce bar was nice and the kids enjoyed the fruit from the buffet\",\"i would safely say that this is the best hot pot restraint to come out of china this venue is the first franchise of this mega china hotpot restaurant in singapore on a weekday during dinner time expect to wait hours to get a seat as they do not take reservations during dinner time the mala spicy sichuan pepper soup is excellent and they do not compromise on the amount of ingredients to prepare the peppery soup base their chicken soup base is made from black chickens and the rich strong taste of the chicken stock can me tasted even without adding in any ingredients the meats are extremely fresh and we will cut all i can say is this is a must try for anyone in the clarke quay area\",\"after reading so many raving reviews i was excited to give this place a try my boyfriend and i went during non peak hours approximately  so the wait was not terrible we waited for approximately  minutes and spent our time trying to solve rubix cube and eating the snacks provided to us the menu and ordering process were simple and straightforward once i tasted the food i was let down the sauces were bland we got chicken and tomato and the prawns were slightly bitter the reason why i give the review three stars is due to the service the wait staff were attentive and the food was brought out quickly all that said i was disappointed by the underwhelming meal and the price was steep for such\",\"i have heard so much about hai di lao so i definitely had to give this a try i tried making a reservation for dinner but it was fully booked thankfully i happen to be part of the vacation ing class of singaporeans who have nothing better to do on a monday at lunchtime than to indulge in some authentic ma la hot pot there was barely any crowd at lunch and we managed to get a table without any wait the pork belly slices were very good they were so good that they managed to con us to order a second serving in which the quality of the meat noticeably dropped the sliced pork was ok but i would recommend going for the pork belly instead the us beef slices were yummy too my only qualm with the meat slices were that they were cut slightly too thick i would have preferred it better if they were just a tad thinner the  pax cost for sauces seemed a little overpriced at first but we soon realised that it included the appetizer peanuts and post meal fruits desserts making the price seem justifiable we didnt know that the drinks were free flow at  pax we stuck to ordering water tea but being kiasu singaporeans would probably have expanded our selection if we knew it wasnt going to cost more the handmade prawn paste was interesting as the paste curled up to look like shrimps after they were cooked for  per serving you can watch a live demonstration of the chef pulling the la mian noodle and here i say that you are paying  to watch a show since i definitely wouldnt pay that money for the very average noodles the mushroom medley was delightful for mushroom lovers the ma la pot is pretty thumb numbing ly spicy you have been warned the bill came up to be about  pax which was kinda expected given all the ratings but still a tad pricey considering that we didnt order much food still i would say that it is one of the better hot pot joints around ps sharing a friend is recipe for the sauce station hoisin sauce korean chilli garlic dash of sesame oil pretty good combination i must say\",\"still quite on the fence about how i feel about haidilao the food was good the mala chili soup was spicy without it being too tongue numbing and i would definitely recommend trying their handmade lamian their services are they definitely go all out to entertain their customers while waiting for a table they provide all sorts of entertainment ladies you can even have a few gel manicure their manicurists are skilled but not to the point of doing intrinsic designs they also give you access to their snack bar free flow of drinks and assorted fruit before you begin eating people with long hair will be offered a hair tie when you order the handmade lamian a guy will perform a sort of dance to pull the noodles the thing that irked me most was the queue even with reservations we waited for over an hour on a weekday night when we saw a free table we asked if we could sit there we were a group of  the hostess said the table was meant for groups of    minutes later she gave the table to a group of  anyway on average you can expect to wait for an hour to  hours during peak period i guess that is why they go all out to entertain their guests still too ridiculously long for me to come back maybe next time i will come back during lunch hour\",\"waited for  hours till my hunger pangs disappeared the service here undoubtedly is impeccable however i do think it is over hyped and priced they recently introduced a takeaway option to host it in the comfort of home but i find the prices laughable a pretty negative review they have an interesting soup base tomato smth soup but the cuts of meat are not exactly worth the price of paying would rather visited the line of steamboat restaurants at bugis\",\"i tried out this place for the first time today and cannot believe it took me this long to do so if not for the long wait i will come here more often we actually did not have to wait long because we had a reservation and got there pretty early but if you are with good company the wait might not be so bad given the free snacks drinks and manicure you can get while waiting this is my new go to spot for hot pot especially with a group the service was amazing and the staff was very attentive to our table and kept the drinks flowing and broth refilled i thought the food was of good quality and they also provide free fruits and desserts i left the place stuffed which rarely happens to me here in singapore oh make sure you get to see the noodle dance\",\"in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth he then created man and then restaurants man began to whine about pathetic service at restaurants especially chinese restaurants so god gave man hai di lao and caused man to stfu well i am sure anyone who complains at hai di lao hot pot needs to see a psychiatrist my mind is completely blown by the extent of service perfection here a chinese restaurant of all places so perfect that even western spots and their pompous matre d are easily put to shame by these down to earth so friendly i would think they would spoon feed me if i would ask servers service their attention to detail is nuts fine fine it is uncommon rare different let me elaborate on some of them everyone gets a cloth apron not the crappy plastic ones you get at spots like boiling crab to keep your clothes clean if you happen to be a messy eater or are experimenting with chopsticks or have a leaking mouth she will even put it on for you if you agree to wear it or you can be like my cousin and i who insisted to have it on our lap instead if you wear glasses you are gifted a microfiber cloth to clean your glasses with before and after your meal or as ocd often as you wish if you have any items out on the table such as phones pocket cameras they will provide ziploc sandwich size bags for you to put them in to keep out the steam and oil unless i am chugging my tea my glass usually gets to half empty when a refill is provided staff continuously checks in at perfect time intervals to ensure that all is well even offering tips on when each ingredient should go in for maximum flavor soup base kept getting refilled without asking hey do not look at me it does not matter what liquid it is i am a freaking camel ask my cousins i treated the hot pot like an oasis staff would sift out the oil froth buildup from the soup on various intervals to keep the soup clean and healthier food my cousin had the half and half soup base one side black chicken broth is immaculate before and after cooking the other side a tomato base if you are a cioppino fan or tomato paste lover like me you will love this base for a hotpot i am so thankful she did not order burn your tongue taste nothing ma la spicy base self served seasoning bar you create your own love elixir to go with whatever is cooking i wo not spend too much time talking about the food because at   average per person as well as a focus on service and perfection the food did not fall short i really enjoyed the quality of the meats and even dipped them for  seconds to eat them on the mid raw side i must admit that i cannot get over the broth i am in love with it and i have never found myself saying that before where i enjoyed the soup base pre cooking and post cooking it was great totally epically awesome oh yeah we did not order the pulled noodle but saw from the other table that it involves a man doing the noodle dance that gets the dough to the right length and consistency before they cut it quite entertaining to see how it never touches him or the floor as he does his advanced rope twirling dance atmosphere other perks you know it is packed but it does not feel like it is the table is spacious and distanced properly to give a somewhat suburban feel that does not make you feel like a sardine you are taken care of from the moment you are in the establishment especially if you did not make a reservation there is a waiting area for children to hang out in watch tv and play various things above all things they also give free manicures w t h mind blownyelp\",\"hai di lao hotpot if my favorite hotpot restaurant ever because of the free snacks the ambiance the servers and everything about hai di lao is fantastic the meat is great the bathrooms are great the noodles are fun to watch and all of the food is good there my only problem with this place is that they do not take reservations and you have to wait around   hours to get a table which is crazy but it is totally worth it\",\"real good petsthis tiny bakery produces phenomenal egg tarts or as i call them portuguese egg tarts pets but here they are uniquely square shaped they are right up there in quality with golden gate bakery of san francisco chinatown rich sweet creamy egg custard filling in a flaky dainty crust its a luxury indulgence given that two pets will buy you a nice complete lunch maxwell food centre a few blocks away across the street from buddah tooth relic temple museum\",\"authentic bakery in chinatown food drink the coconut egg tart was something else we have never had one before and this is just one of the many places around singapore to get it a perk is you can get a box full of a dozen pretty easily price only   sgd for one egg tart atmosphere we came in in the middle of the day when it was very hot there was a seating area where you could enjoy your treats that was air conditioned and it was a perfect break from the sweltering heat in chinatown tips they sell a variety of baked goods other than egg tarts\",\"we visited the chinatown heritage centre the day before where one of the exhibits mentioned tong heng and their famous egg tarts i love egg tarts so i made it a point to check this place out conclusion solid egg tart but nothing special there are no advantages of making the egg tart in a diamond shape versus the regular circular base not worth going out of your way to try\",\"nice egg tart was not sure i would like it but it was delicious nice clean store and helpful employees\",\"i decided to go to tong heng for their diamond shaped egg tarts due to their long family history in the business from watching a food bloggers video the egg tarts were alright maybe because i am a fan of the flaky crust i did not enjoy it as much it is definitely not terrible above average but it just did not meet my expectations\",\"double thumbs up for their egg tarts tong heng is a real timeless institution that has been around for at least  years they are well known among the locals for having the best egg tart in singapore and when they are that famous i just had to check it out for myself the store lies at the heart of chinatown just along south beach road the shop itself is petite in space but interior is very bright and proper they also have quite an arrays of delicacies that are displayed inside the glass cabinet and of course coffee drink to go along with the sweets the diamond shaped egg tart is truly unique the shells have thick layers of crisp pastry almost like it was deep fried and the custard filling is so smooth wobbly and a bliss in each bite each tart cost around   small price to pay for one of a kind sweet indulgence\",\"it is funny to squeeze in this tiny shop usually to a crowd of grandmas buying boxes or some guy with a video camera zooming in on the little pig pastries the cashiers are really efficient and the space is small but clean and brightly lit with all the pastries nicely displayed i keep bringing friends here and really recommend their egg tarts tong heng mastered the recipe with fresh flaky crust and soft custard filling i actually love the coconut egg tart more than the original as you get more texture and sweetness from the shredded coconut i will always make tong heng a stop when i am in town\",\"to begin with we ordered the coconut tart and the chicken puff with coffee when we bit into the tart we realised it was the plain egg tart we immediately approached the counter and told them that the order was not right the young guy behind the counter started to rudely tell us off by saying that we ordered the egg one and it was our fault for not pointing to the coconut one i had heard my partner saying very clearly that she wanted the coconut and pointing to it the woman also gave us an attitude anyway i decided to buy the coconut tart even though my partner wanted to leave they should have offered us to pay the difference and i would have given it a higher rating than two stars long story short the egg tart the coconut tart and the chicken puff are all tasty but they know that people will keep coming back no matter how they are treated so they do not care\",\"i drop by whenever i am at china town the egg tart has always been of the same good standard over the years the egg is smooth and the skin is crispy the only person with the egg tart is that the price keeps going up\",\"came here in mid morning for some famous rectangular dan ta after a morning of exploring chinatown nearby the cashier lady was an older obasan who was extremely patient and kind with us as we scoured the display window for a avoid the sun snack we decided on dan ta is each their powdered bread which i totally forgot the name the baked goods were not spectacular but that is because we are spoiled with delicious california baked goods and cheap fresh taiwanese bakery bread when we travel their dan ta has a crunchier and thinner not flaky crust and sweeter egg in the center it was pretty good just made differently and just as fresh their powdered bread was not the business we felt like it was just bread with powdered sugar on top nothing special looking around we saw that they also offered other baked sweets as well as more kitchen made orders like soups and porridges it is great to get a dan ta if you are in the ann siang hill chinatown area but it is not some place i would say is a distinguishing part of singaporean local eats\",\"just get the egg tarts forget about the rest the coffee is terrible but they do warn you it is from a sachet mix the egg tart is usually warm so it is best to eat it right there and then the custard is wobbly soft and the crust is a bit crumbly when you bite into it have it cool and the shape holds better but it also means it is slightly firmer it is sweet but not overly so it does make a good tea time or any time snack it is a nice treat to have once in a while\",\"yesss their egg tarts were amazing i highly recommend getting the coconut one too which was my favorite the shell looks like it would be hard but it was buttery and soft probably one of the best egg tarts i have had\",\"excellent quality custard tarts which come in two flavors unique tart custard with coconut and the traditional custard tart the custard perfect and light also tried a couple other items a sesame cookie with red bean paste and another with lotus bean filling all very delicious i am gonna have to run an extra two miles tomorrow morning cause i am gaining weight the staff a very friendly and efficient\",\"love the omelet kaya toast the toast is super crispy topped with egg and kaya spread on top delicious they sell three different types of kaya coconut egg jam by the jar with the nonya kaya being the most popular they even let you sample before you buy i am definitely taking some home will need to sample one of those egg tarts while i am at it\",\"service ive seen comments on good service but maybe it was an off day but they were not very welcoming nice food egg tart and moon cake was good atmosphere overall fine price   egg tartdiamond shaped egg tarts was a first i feel like the ratio of crust to egg was different because it is a seemingly pretty popular place it seemed like their egg tarts had a decent turn over so getting fresh warmer ones may be the norm the custard is not too thick and it is silky which is nice i tried the normal one not the coconut the moon cake with lotus paste was also good not overly wow ed by the place if i was in the area and craving egg tarts maybe i would return but at this point i would not go out of my way to do so\",\"super friendly service some of the best egg tarts in singapore best part the tarts are uniquely diamond shaped so they stand out from the others try to get the ones that are piping hot fresh out of the oven one bite and you will be hooked they are insanely delicious warm flaky crust with the right amount of custard to crust ratio i still prefer their original tarts over the coconut but i must point out that they are made with some big pieces of shredded coconut extra plus i did not get to try their other baked goods items but it looks like they specialize in wedding cookies too\",\"located near maxwell food centre and in the vicinity of chinatown you find this shop opposite a taoist temple along south bridge road i usually recommend this confectionary shop to my foreign friends as they sell decent egg tarts and other pastries good for our taste bug but bad for our stomach eat the egg tarts warm as you get the best out of this delicious snack the others are average nothing to shout about but it is worth giving them a try i would recommend buying a few and head elsewhere to enjoy it like carolyn the other reviewer had mentioned the coffee is mediocre so if you are nearby maxwell food centre orchinatown remember to head down best is to leave some space for some egg tarts after a meal you will probably feel very satisfied enjoy\",\"order the egg tarts best egg tarts i have tasted crust is flaky and the inside is warm and custardy there was no line as we got there pretty early\",\"most of the times i have been here every egg tart i have gotten has been warm from the oven having said that eating it warm and cold has a marked difference eat it cold you wo not like the crust because it becomes hard eat it warm and the crust is crispy three stars because i do not like a crispy crust but the custard is light eggy and not too sweet i still do buy it sometimes yum\",\"i cannot believe i completely forgot to write a review for tong heng it is been nearly a month since i have had these and i am still dreaming about them i happened to be in the area and stopped by to pick up a couple tarts i am kicking myself for not getting more and char siew pastry puffs for the family and they were definitely pleasantly surprised i did not get a chance to sit down at tong heng is to have them fresh but trust me heat them up a little when you get home and i can bet they are as good as they are fresh if not then i am really missing out the egg tarts are lightly sweet and just egg y enough and the pastry is a little different being crumbly rather than flaky and i love it the char siew pastry puffs are just as good in my opinion sweet and flaky but with the right amount of savory to do the char siew justice so it is whatever you are in the mood for or have them both\",\"honestly i was disappointed i have heard about this being some awesome unique amazing event perhaps my expectations were too high i attended the night creatures show which was cool but two of the animals never did their trick or showed their talent i get it animals get a vote but the trainers just could not get it done then the  minute tram ride it was a neat idea but most of the animals just laid around like they do during the day only parts of the exhibits were lite up so in some cases the trains automated narration would call of animals i never even saw because the corona virus is going around the park was actually pretty empty which was nice if you have the chance do this maybe the animals will be more active for you i did the   time slot i am glad i crossed it off my list but i wo not go back\",\"night safari had cool animals but you only got to see about half of them they are incredibly mindful and respectful towards the animals so you literally feel like you are actually going on a safari in the night time the whole zoo is entirely dark and they only have a few lights per enclosure with extremely dim light so if the animals are not out in that particular spot you will miss them although a lot of recommendations online tell you not to do all three zoo activities in one day i believe pretty much everyone does the night safari has a horrendous wait the entrance line to get in the tram line and the show line felt like a war or zombie invasion people are incredibly aggressive and obviously all want to be in front and get in i think the show is the best part everything else besides the waits require extreme patience acceptance to disappointment in case you do not get to see half the animalsi did this under  hours but i am sure you could take a little extra time if you like this location is kind of in the middle of nowhere but not too far from the main part of singapore it takes roughly  minutes to get here from the city from my experience night safari and river safari are cool to do but not necessary if you have to choose one out of the three if i had to put them in order it would be singapore zoo night safari then river safari\",\"we had tickets to the night safari for friday night at  pm but our dinner went longer than expected so we did not get here until  pm also it takes a long time to get here from downtown you take a subway to a stop far north then have to find a very poorly designated spot for a shuttle to take you the rest of the way also important to note the zoo closes at midnight as does the public transportation if you do not drive you are stuck taking a cab which cost us about  usd to get back downtown not too bad all things considered and there were several taxis waiting by the exit i was kind of bummed we got only about an hour and a half to explore but we made the most of it since it was so late the park was mostly empty so we did not run into the crowds other people talked about our local friend advised us to skip the show so we jumped on the tram instead it was a short tour around the zoo but we saw some amazing sights from rhinos to elephants to a tiger some of the animals are free roaming and were feeding right next to the tram which was a nice surprise afterwards we tried to see as much of the zoo as possible on foot which is a bit tiring since it is very hilly and very dark still it is pretty incredible to see a zoo where most of the animals are not asleep experiences like a prowling jaguar stalking right toward you hearing a lion roar from across the zoo and seeing a stealthy crocodile swim right near your feet are all pretty unique the zoo is kind of a maze but it seems the employees here have an efficient system for making sure everyone gets out safely when time is up at midnight they cannot exactly turn on the lights or make loud announcements but we got out with no issue the commute is a pain and you have to balance fighting crowds with limited time before time is up it is still a must visit for any zoo enthusiast or animal lover\",\"we went on the jungle cruise inthe afternoon and the night safari in the evening night safari is awesome and the sights and animals are wonderful\",\"i had the best time at the night safari even with a  pm entrance on a saturday night i arrived to the premise around  pm but i like that the times are staggered for crowd control to kill time there is a food court with different cuisines i opted for overpriced indian food but it was so hot that i ate just to eat right upon entering at  pm i dashed to the tram tour that lasted under an hour lots of animals were in hiding but few were out and about after the tour i walked the different trails one of my favorite parts was stumbling upon feeding time a zookeeper had a bucket of cut fruits and as he tossed them around the area many of the animals came out from hiding at the moment i cannot recall which type of animal i just remembered that the animals looked happy chomping away my other favorite part about the safari was the live animal show the animals not sure what kind performed various tricks after the show you can take a photo with the animals well the zookeeper holds the animal and is also in the picture with you the night safari is suitable for all audiences ranging from kids to adults to elders exploring the safari makes for a great date night idea\",\"night safari used to be a five star experience for me however this time it definitely lost lustre night safari is the world is first night zoo the park uses special lighting for visitors to enjoy nocturnal behaviours of animals around the world my family and i have bookmarked it as a must do every time we come we bought a  parkhopper pass to see all the wildlife themed parks in singapore for a great price of s  per adult this includes all the tram rides i noticed that i had to book an entry time for night safari which surprised me i chose the   pm entry the park closes at   am after midnight when we arrived the crowds were so thick that we were pushed body to body the   pm group was herded to the creatures of the night show which i remembered to be rather stunning and interesting in the past but sitting with shoulders hips and legs touching your neighbour in a crowded amphitheater diminished our experience of the show this time we exited quickly because we knew that there was going to be a mad rush for the tram ride after the show ended we left our seats after the otter recycling even so we were not the only ones we continued to wait for more than half an hour to get on a tram ride the ride was probably the best part of the evening we got to see the tapirs really close we did not get to hear the tigers roar we saw a lot of deer usually we made time to walk through the trails but the thickness of the crowds on this june peak time because of school holidays we decided to go home i do not envy the park staff who have the unfortunate job of managing loud and pushy visitors\",\"had such an amazing time on the night safari tonight i am sure most people give lower ratings because of the long lines which there definitely were some very long lines to wait in to get on the tram but the experience was awesome we got to see some animals that only come out at night which you never get to see in a regular zoo there were tigers walking around deer roaming free which were right next to the tram maybe a foot or two away at some point wolves howling and many more amazing things to see the lines are long but do not let that stop you from coming here it was worth the wait\",\"so night safari sounds super cool right too bad it rains everyday in singapore more like singa pour and the animals seal shelter just as we do unfortunate experience for us really it is expensive a meal for one is  tickets are  the trolley takes you around the main strip and you can see all sorts of animals hippos elephants deer zebras hyenas all sorts of pigs etc cool to see but it is dark you cannot get any pics of them and you kind feel sad that they are kept enclosed by electrocuted fences i wondered how they could have a lion across from a zebra without anything happening the zoo is really open so the animals do not appear to be caged which is a really cool view but i am sure we would have enjoyed it without the rain our tour guide said it would take an hour to walk the  walking trails to see a closer look of the animals and it took us roughly  min there just was not anything to look at fortunately we found a tiger laying right on the glass easily the coolest thing we saw they shirts for  are a rip off go to the market they are  for  just do not buy anything here the food selection is scarce like they force you to eat at their  a meal restaurants or you are stuck eating finger foods that were pre made hours ago for  hmmm you win there safari i actually saw a beer jug for  insane must be fun if you have kids maybe idk skip it as an adult\",\"the safari was truly the best experience ever i was quite impressed by the way they have managed the place to make sure that we got the best view of all the animals we took the tram not the trail as we were pretty tired by the end of the day the only reason why i cannot give this place a  star review is because of dinner it was so disgusting the quality of food was poor the place was sweaty like hell and it was outrageously expensive  per person not worth it at all\",\"first thing buy your tickets online dont buy them at the zoo itself because you are only allowed in based on your slotted time and the lines are so long we arrived at   pm and waited until  to get in for the   slot time was killed watching the fire dancers and wondering through gift stores and these people start lining up at like   pm to get in for the   so people dont play here also this place is super far from changi and center city it is at least  mins to an hour to get out here depending if you bus train etc it is quite a trek out here even for people like myself who have been to singapore often enough to call it a distant home second hydrate before you go singapore is humid and hot and you will dehydrate anywhere you go in singapore if you dont bring adequate water but the good thing is that there is free water filling stations around so make sure you are doing that third if you were hoping for pics forget it it is nocturnal and the only pics you will get is the animal show the animal show is not bad and you will see their alright length python binturong river otters fishing cat hyena owls and couple of others i thought the show was alright if you have time worth sitting and getting pics with the animals other wise you re better off on the tram ride and walking the trailsthe tram alright the lines are so long that most of your time will be eaten up with the waiting in line and then the fairly long ride i thought the tram ride was satisfying for the time i waited for my   slot and the  min waiting time to get on my tram you definitely get to see creatures in open air and a lot of them roaming freely deer tapir and some others that you wont get to see in other zoos bc they are nocturnal i thought the tigers and lions were huge compared to other zoos where i thought the creatures were smaller than i expected it is night time so it will be cooling avoid talking loudly and no flash during the night you will get dinged for this at the show and at the tram so dont be that person trails we were so tired from waiting in line and trekking across singapore to get here that we didn t do any trails so come early book online and be prepared for the long long trek across the country if you are based in changgi airport\",\"the zoo in the dark yes yes and yes it was as though i was transported into the movie jurassic park riding along in the tram i knew i was safe but at the same time i kept thinking where is the lion can he reach me if he decides he wants a little snack absolutely wonderful a must visit place the tram ride is the best part of the experience the show creatures of the night was just so so but perfect for children\",\"this will be a combined review of both the safari and the restaurant buffet we purchased a package with the buffet and priority tram boarding which seemed like a good deal servicethe dinner was a buffet so self service including beverages the server did occasionally pick up dirty plates but many did stack up on the table over time after dinner we were fairly quickly ushered past the lines onto our tram which was great the commentary on the tram was pre recorded which was ok but i was expecting more customized commentary from the guide also the tram did not even come to a complete stop at many key animal enclosures including the male elephant which is one of the zoo is main highlights this resulted in blurred photos due to tram movement ambiancewell they decided to design an open air buffet in a humid climate at a zoo so low points for ambiance there were fans but it was humid and uncomfortable during the meal bugs were buzzing around also various zoo aromas often wafted in an enclosed air conditioned environment would have been much preferred the tram ride was about  minutes through the park there were several animal exhibits to see but often the tram did not stop so photos were blurred due to movement at night overall it was fairly peaceful and relaxing definitely try to get the priority tram boarding as otherwise lines were long the fire show after the tram ride was quite good and one of the highlights of the experience foodthere was a somewhat varied selection of western and eastern options but the quality overall was low some of the items advertised as chicken on a skewer appeared gray in color not normal for chicken the tandoori was probably the best normal appearing chicken breast meat the ice creams were poorly frozen and were melty immediately after scooping them many items were uncovered which seemed odd in an open air buffet beverage options were severely limited water or hot tea or coffee no soda fountain or other cold drinks jujuthis was overall a unique experience to see the animals at night which one does not get the chance to at other zoos the tram was cool definitely go for the priority boarding package the buffet was quite disappointing avoid it as it is underwhelming to say the least and frankly a bit gross in some respects\",\"i went back and forth on this it is recommended by a few places even shows up in some suggested itineraries in travel guides but in the end i feel like it fell short to start it is not easy to get to several bus transfers and a long ride it is worth looking in to how to get here which i really did not and booking a ticket on a non stop bus from downtown if that is where you are staying once there you can buy your way home on a non stop bus which will cost a few sgd more than the public buses but is much faster once inside there is a creatures of the night show which i skipped and a tram ride which i skipped with the idea being that the tram only shows part of the zoo while the walking trails cover all of it so i started my walk and the first few stops were animal no shows i know the zoo cannot control this but i was really steeling myself for this to be a bust but it got better however while it is cool to see the animals at night i cannot help but think it would be even better to see them during the day you know when you can see them better maybe all of these animals are nocturnal but i sure do not think so and even then some were still sleeping so yes i saw them but i did not see them doing anything as others have pointed out the exhibits are largely completely open air which is cool and there are a lot of animals that i do not feel like i would see at a zoo in the us however i made the mistake of doing this the first full day i was in singapore after flying in from the us and being active most of the day i needed a nap pretty bad by the time i got here which might have made me less patient i think if i had it to do over again i would visit the zoo during the day or maybe skip entirely\",\"although i appreciate the so called efforts of bringing animal awareness to the people this tour is so commercialized was a little depressing animals are kept awake w low lighting until  pm no flash photos something good i do believe the animals are cared for tho location area has dense foliage to protect most animals from the heat\",\"interesting concept got to see different animals on a tram ride through different sections of the park they all seemed really chill and grubbing on their greens i wonder how they all stay so calm with people near by good for the kids and adults\",\"i absolutely loved my experience at the night safari the timing worked out so that when i entered the zoo a live show was about to start so i went there first the live show was great our announcer i do not remember his name but it was  pm on a wednesday was amazing he was very funny and friendly after the show i went on the tram to see all of the nocturnal animals the narrations were nice albeit a bit too quiet to hear my tram did break about  of the way through the ride so we had to wait for about five minutes for someone to come and tow us back it is too bad that i was not able to hear about the rest of the animals but even without the narration at the end the experience was great\",\"this is a very cool concept and i came into the safari with admittedly high expectations i felt that the show was overrated as it mainly consisted of a trainer walking around for thirty seconds with the animal on their shoulder it was hard to get a good look of the animals given the size of the auditorium and i felt the time given to look at the animals was much to short after finishing the show we embarked on the tram as it is a night safari it is decently hard to see the animals while there are some lights to try to make the viewing experience better for visitors they are dim which is to be expected given the time of day we saw a lot of animals like tigers and giraffes animals that are much more active during the day given that it is night time a lot of these animals were either not moving or sleeping overall it was a cool experience but i would not do it again if you only have a few days in the city there are other things to do that is much better value for your time at around  sgd it is also not cheap\",\"coming here on new year is day not the greatest idea not sure how the crowd and lines are for normal days non holidays but coming here was an absolute zoo pun intended doors open at pm and tickets are available for advance purchase online or at the visitor is centers my friends and i had brought our tickets beforehand at a visitor center and decided to arrive here early to beat the crowd sadly that was not the case the wait to pick up our physical ticket was over an hour long with only  person working the counter for ticket pick up after picking up our physical tickets it was another hour wait to get in the attraction once in the attraction it was starting to get late boarded the tram at pm so my friends and i opted to just go for a ride vs getting on and off to explore the walking trails overall it was a pretty interesting experience to see the animals at night not a whole lot of pictures could be taken with a cellphone or camera since flash photography was forbidden fortunately we were able to see most of the animals that were awake and it was pretty cool to see the lions and such up close as for bugs there were not too many but i did spray bug repellent on prior to boarding the tram the ride itself is roughly half hour long and it is a pretty smooth one in summary if you are a fan of animals and want to see them at night this would be a good attraction to visit however it is a bit overrated in the experience so i would recommend checking out the zoo instead during the day to avoid all the madness at night in addition it is much easier to get here by taxi vs mrt\",\"it is sad to only give this place only  stars however i do not think it is worth a trip to go all the way out here you spend a lot of time in lines we came here part of a packaged tour the tour guide told us that the best plan to make use of our time after the singapore zoo next door was to have dinner inside the night safari park once they open the doors we were then to line up for their earliest tram it was a good tip because everybody lines up way ahead of time the tram ride was disappointing it takes about  minutes it is dark so you cannot really see much there is no fence between you and the animals which i guess is a good thing if you want to see the animals with no barriers but i started imagining the tigers were going to leave their exhibit to come after us as a meal and there would be no fence between us yea by that time i could not wait for the tram ride to be over afterwards there is an animal show but we opted to call it a day and leave since we had to line up for it as well the whole park is a bit overrated definitely not worth a trip unless you have very young kids who would love the experience of seeing so many animals\",\"make sure to wear insect repellent i felt like i was getting bitten the entire night i also recommend spending at least a couple of hours since the tram tour takes  minutes and that did not include the wait time there were also  different self guided walking paths that will take you to different parts of the zoo although it was a little disappointing since i was expecting a lot more animals there were a lot of deers and lemurs lastly it was difficult to take pictures with an iphone since they do not allow flash photography no disturbing the animals tip i repeat no flash photography\",\"had my lunch with my family at this place the restaurant had a nice dining ambience and staff greeted us friendly we tried a few items like the century egg congee crispy pork buns and chew cheong fun the pork buns are indeed worthy to be called their signature dish it was so flavourful and the visual was very enticing recommended to give this a try if you are craving for dim sum in singapore\",\"very good and affordable dim sum place if you come during tea time between lunch and dinner you get a wide selection of dishes for   which is a steal the chashabao is crafted beautifully crunchy sweet and also savory gotta love the combination of textured and flavors the shaomai and other dumplings do not skimp out on meat and shrimp and the flavor is very consistent throughout the dishes only downside is no outside drinks and that service can be a little rough at times also charging for hand towels seems a little too old fashioned and annoying\",\"my first time trying tim ho wan was in sydney three years ago and i fell in love instantaneously being from the usa i was super excited to see so many thw locations in singapore this one in citylink is the closest to marina bay sands where we were staying no wait for lunch surprisingly and our meal did not disappoint everything is so tasty but my two favorite things are the baked bbq pork bun and steamed egg cake so good that we ordered a second round for both the only thing that i would skip next time would be the egg tarts i have definitely had better elsewhere pricey for dim sum but completely worth it at least once in my opinion\",\"i went to tim ho wan for dim sum lunch i ordered a bunch of dishes so here are some highlights the prawn dumplings were pretty good the pork siewmai was very tasty the steamed egg cake is a nice light and fluffy consistency the pork rice rolls were fine the hong kong style egg tarts were some of the best i have had and the mango sago was refreshing the service speed is fast the prices are okay for this type of dim sum food there is a decent amount of seating though not as much as in most dim sum places overall tim ho wan has solid cantonese dim sum food i initially came here because i read that it got a michelin star but after eating there i did not feel like it was really that exceptional still if you are interested in tasty dim sum tim ho wan is a very good choice\",\"so i passed this place due to the iphone not giving good directions once i finally made all i can say was yummy i wondered the shrimp dumplings spinach and shrimp dumplings chicken spring rolls which are fried the fried milk custard and also the braised beef noodle soup everything was delicious i should have ordered more the only thing that i did not care for was the braised beef noodle soup it was not what i expect has far as flavor even when adding sauces to it it just was not tasty at all one michelin star of yummy greatness check it out\",\"one michelin star for an inexpensive dim sum restaurant alright this one was located just off the city hall mrt station in singapore and seemed to have the best rating and review on yelp i ordered a bunch of dishes with my niece and her friends and here it goes the bbq pork bun was baked not steamed but it was very good the bread layer was pretty thin and there was a substantial amount of bbq pork filling there was an air gap but it all just seemed to be in the right proportions the har gau or shrimp dumpling was also very good they had a small wonton noodle dish that was also good and they had these green skinned wonton like it was made from spinach in fact most of it compared very well with some of the best dim sum i have ever had maybe not a michelin star but close prices compared with those in california so no complaints i will be back again to try some of the other dishes go try it\",\"we had a light lunch today the fried rice veggie dumplings and shumai were good beyond our expectation service was really prompt and no gimmicks we got what we wanted at no time after lunch just brought the order sheet to the cashier and pay that is it really nice\",\"in  summer i lined up like everyone else did in front of the original tim ho wan in hong kong it got a michelin star that year dubbed as the cheapest michelin in fact i took the opportunity to try it one last time in  but ultimately it became an impossible task as the fan base was growing so it expanded i heard the new york outpost is lackluster but i do not get to come to singapore often enough and it is right inside the hotel so it felt appropriate to try it was a hot and humid  degree weather and i did not want to go outdoors turns out the place was half empty i got a nice seat and ordered what was popular the bbq pork buns the chicken feet the ribs etc try to stay carb free by eating the fillings only the verdict is that it is good but not as good as circa  in hong kong after its receipt of the michelin still i like my nostalgia and familiarity a good find\",\"suprised to see this michelin star dim sum at underground mrt walkway in singapore realized they have many locations their turnip cake was a serious disappointment it was pure white radish not hot and no toppings inside the famous bbq bun was good but a little too sweet salty good amount of filling\",\"really great dim sum place but then again they are famous for that the place is rather small since it is located inside a mall but the service is fast and so is table turnover we were lucky that we got a seat right away during a lunch rush hour everything on the table was delicious and satisfying great price and great dim sum\",\"ever since tim ho wan has opened in nyc i have always wanted to go but knew that there were always long lines so ironically enough i end up in singapore and realize that many of the globally recognized dim sum spots that are delicious tim ho wan too many din tai fungs to count appear to be here and this one being in the mall right next to the hotel we are staying it does not get any better than rolling out for breakfast right when tim ho wan opens at   am and there is no line or wait to speak of we got seated quickly our food came out quickly and while the service was not personable you are not coming here because you expect to be treated like a king i finally got to see what all the hype was about especially the pork buns holy cow is all i can say i have had some good pork buns and there is a really good cheap spot in nyc chinatown that i love but the buns here are by far the best i have had the roll is a little sweet but not that thick at all and the pork inside is deliciously savory if i had more time in singapore and more stomach space i would probably grab an order of these to go every day the rest of the dim sum was pretty good as well i particularly liked the pork ribs served in black bean sauce as the sauce was a much lighter version i was expecting the ribs to be drenched in a heavy marinade and made each bite less heavy but just as flavorful the bean curd skin was juicy and moist and the shumai was fresher and less dry than most other versions i have encountered elsewhere although the flavor was not necessarily any more distinctive in all i get the hype when it comes to the buns the rest of the food is quite good as well it is basically a more premium better prepared version of dim sum but if you can get in i understand why folks really love the food here and are willing to wait for it the takeout line here is a plus for sure in the event that you are on the go\",\"this is one of the better location of tim ho wan comparing to the ones in the states and vietnam the prices do not differ much at each place remaining quite reasonable and even low for such quality of food and service  years ago i got driven here by a taxi driver after asking for a good place for dim sum in singapore and was told it won a michelin star i was not disappointed at all the dishes were of good taste and high quality besides the basic dishes like har gow of shu mai their specialities are excellent my must order dish for every visit is the one i do not remember the name topped with wasabi sauce and roe sometimes they have seasonals and during winter time they made a delicious mini har gow dish made to be eaten with sichuan peppercorns sauce for such a famous and busy place food got served surprisingly quickly and still piping hot i definitely recommend everyone to check it out if you are a big fan of dim sum\",\"impressive line up of savory dim sum place is really good for a dim sum experience its one of the good dim sum places ive ever been\",\"food    service    value    decor    overall    the dim sum here was very good but not mind blowing the baked bbq pork buns in particular were very popular i thought they were good but not as much as some of the others at my table did try coming later in the day to avoid long lines look forward to trying the original s in hong kong that actually garnered the perhaps politicized m s\",\"the dim sum is good but the location is stark and the service is really poor it reminds me of a dirty middle school cafeteria think mash potatoes is lop and plop by the old woman with the hairnet all that is missing is the cigarette hanging from her mouth yet another example of what singapore is willing to tolerate for restaurant settings\",\"this is just a review for their pick up counter but yes it is awesome so good ordered the following bbq pork buns  buns   sgd pan fried carrot radish cake  pieces   beancurd skin w shrimp  rolls   hong kong style egg tart buy  get one free   i was walking through raffles place and just sat down on a bench and started eating because they do recommend that you eat the bbq buns within an hour boy am i glad i started eating early what is so outstanding about this dim sum is that the main ingredients really shine through in terms of flavor as amazing as the crust is for the bbq buns the pork is actually the star the radish flavor of the cakes were so noticeable in a good way that it make you feel like their radishes were fresh the beancurd skin was crispy and had a balanced amount of filling not too little nor too much just right that is when you know you have got good dim sum everything tastes just right no heavy feeling after eating it i basically ate all of that in an afternoon and felt fine\",\"cha siew bao must try the cha siew bao is so good that my gf get a nose bleed when she eats it so get those tissues ready the pork liver vermicelli roll is pretty good but personally i think something is missing in there the next best favourite would be the chicken feet tender and fat well marinated and tasty down to the bones we had the chew siew noodles and the glutinous rice both fills the tummy with its sizeable portion the tonic medlar jelly dessert with wolfberries is a delight  for two pax reasonable\",\"well i loveeeeeee eating at tim ho wan only if there is no queue this is the th outlet in singapore and i chanced upon it while on my way to another restaurant which i gave up no queue during weekend dinner hour yay surprised to see new additions on the menu at this outlet that is pretty much adjusted to fit local taste buds laksa wanton and chilli crab taro dumpling we ordered   of their  big  heavenly kings baked bbq pork bun and pork liver vermicelli roll pork congee and century egg salted egg beancurd skin with shrimp and chilli crab taro dumpling we enjoyed every dish we ordered except for the beancurd skin with shrimp we really enjoy pork liver cooked just right something that is really hard to find in singapore consistency of those baked bbq pork bun which they maintained for all their franchise stalls well balanced pork congee that is not too salty and that really tasty chilli crab taro dumpling that is fried perfectly with a punch of fire after the chilli crab gets down to my stomach i felt that there was no need for any sauces throughout the meal the beancurd skin with shrimp the fried dish not to be confused with the steamed version was a little disappointing for me though as it is too oily not at least served on an oil filter paper very little shrimp and the texture is rather mushy and the portion is small i would have opt for the option of beancurd skin with pork and shrimp instead the steamed version totally not worth  for those  tiny pieces this outlet has password protected wifi but when i asked the staff he mentioned that they are not make known the password to the wifi so dang no wifi here paid about  for this meal to satisfy  tummy it is still worth it for the great quality of the food and services\",\"the dim sum was pretty tasty and perfectly cooked except for the ya chow fried rice which was bland\",\"great dim sum fast efficient service the pork buns were probably the best i have had has a fast food feel to it but very attentive wait staff\",\"sugar cane prawns     starsit tasted a bit too sweet and artificial as if they used those frozen prawn balls instead of fresh or frozen prawns cockles stir fried with garlic and lard     starsnot my thing i find cockles kind of smelly and pungent but my friends loved it sliced beef noodle soup  starsgood pho not sure which beef pho dish we got but it was delicious the soup was flavoured just right the noodles had the right texture and the beef was not too tough stir fried beef noodle with lemongrass     starsmy least favourite of the noodle dishes we had the beef was too dry and tough and there was not anything else in the dish to make up for that special beef combination noodle soup  starsnot sure which bun dish we got it had spring rolls and meat balls the meat balls were amazing soft juicy and flavourful the best vietnamese food i have had in singapore nam nam is got nothing on this\",\"caught some pho on a rainy day pho was delicious spring rolls were good too service was awful walked in when there was only one other customer who left shortly after we arrived the entire staff was enjoying their lunch while we had to walk halfway up to them to ask to order ask to pay and everything else in between bathroom is disgusting not sure how this place has so many good reviews but we were not impressed although the food was good it did not make up for the staff also beware they charge extra for napkins and water and cash only\",\"just mediocre vietnamese food appetizers pho more i have given this place several chances and i am just over it there are much better places in town that are worth your cravings meh\",\"went there and waited at the table for  minutes waiting for a waiter to come and take our order turns out that you have to pay first before you can eat they charge for tissues and they only serve bottled water grumpy cashier and manager walked out without eating wont be going back again\",\"great location for sightseeing near arab st and good pho bo tai and papaya salad reasonable prices fast service what is not to like june\",\"stopped here on my way home from the office asked for a beer no beer no problem i asked for a cup of water with my pho was told only mineral water available i left and went elsewhere\",\"i did not try the pho but we did get quite the selection of appetizers which were all phenomenal yum i would definitely go back and recommend to anyone good prices too\",\"this review is mainly for the crab noodles because it is my favorite thing on the menu the pho is good but not as good as these crab noodles yum the line here on weekends can get quite insane but i arrived at pm and held on to my table for dear life service is efficient but they were quite confused with our orders as we constantly placed new orders instead of placing one at one go i guess they are more used to people who show up to eat and leave and not us grazing types the fresh roll is not my favorite but i quite liked the meatballs they are nice and juicy and come with a delicious dipping sauce but enough distractions let me talk about the crab noodles unlike pho they come with mee tai mak which is a kind of short rice noodle and is super slippery and look like little tails as a result you have to scoop them up with a spoon inhaling all that delicious broth along the way the soup is like a super jazzed up version of pho broth with all the added umami delightfulness of crab and seafood the bowl is generously topped with crab pork meatballs as well as some shrimp i literally inhaled the entire bowl in one go and had barely anything left for my companions who wanted to try it oops i would go back again just for my favorite crab noodles i have also tried the bun and pho which are good but pale in comparison to those crabby savory delicious noodles\",\"came here as a tourist from america and was thoroughly disappointed the waitresses and owner were just outright rude and yelled at us for asking for some lime we asked for waters as well and they rolled their eyes and walked away from us food was not very good either and they tried charging us more than what we ordered thinking we were tourist and unaware would not recommend this place to anyone looking for\",\"pros good food food arrives quick nice interior cool menu with pictures affordable cons rude af waitresses what are you doing thai iced tea is all ice ask for a cold one without ice or you will be paying s   for a glass of ice pho was very average go somewhere with better service the menu and interior were the most redeeming parts of this restaurant\",\"excellent food good prices fast service we enjoyed it so much we even came back a second time\",\"i was excited to read the glowing reviews of this place and got my expectations high i grew up eating pho in canada both toronto and vancouver where you just cannot miss the numerous pho restaurants dotting the cities so my standard of good pho is what you get from any pho place in north america there is just no bad pho over there and it is a staple food in every vietnamese family there first off the chairs are most uncomfortable the stools are too high for me to eat off the table easily i felt i was bending over double just to eat and i am a short person then the combination of air conditioning and fan going gives two types of temperature you get the cool air followed by a blast of warm air it is most disconcerting i ordered the sliced beef and brisket pho with extra beef balls the soup is tasty though i wish it also comes with a side plate of bean sprouts and basil and slice chili and lime for customer to add to it the meat is terrible i cannot see or taste the brisket at all and the meat is very chewy and tough such a big disappointment the beef ball is good though i cannot tell if it is handmade or from a machine the summer tea takes some getting used to i will suggest to stick to the vietnamese coffee or something the service is good though bring cash i do not remember if it accept nets definitely no credit card facility here at the moment i think pho tam anh at chinatown point is better for pho\",\"best pho in singapore hands down what dish do i reccomend everything most of the soups and noodles i have eaten here are great i love going with friends and ordering different ones to share\",\"food taste authenticprice reasonable market rate chicken beef pho sgd  ambience just like typical vietnamese restaurant but just half a shop so very noisy and crowded seating just stool non back support so have to finish fast and leave not suitable for pregnancy woman and children tips avoid weekend especially saturday the soup finish by pm yet the shop close at pm so everyone do not get any soup based stuff except asam soup based in the picture and spicy beef soup bbq pork rice and dry vermicelli still available no tax gst but charges  for service charge the usual charges service charge but had to go to counter to pay bill so the only service they do is to bring your order to your table does not justify the  service charge\",\"salad was good spring roll sticking to each other pho was average am i crazy service was fine no rudeness to be detected if you like a hipster vibe over food this is for you\",\"this place has almost reached cult status with singaporeans it often runs out of ph in the late afternoon early evening so we wanted to try it out the ph broth is pretty flavourful but it is not served piping hot as it should be the is pecial version only has beef brisket and beef balls but no raw beef or tripes and the beef brisket is rather chewy the mini clams is cooked with a delightful garlic sauce and served with sinful but scrumptious lard the chicken wings are below average venturing to the toilet shows how unhygienic part of the back section is next time we would try newly opened ph c hai on the same block of beach road or stick to long phng in joo chiat which is much better more authentic and with a more diverse longer menu\",\"this is probably a   star place so i will round up for generosity hailing from melbourne with a massive vietnamese population and having had two vietnamese ex girlfriends my judgements of vietnamese food are always benchmarked against what i have had back home which means i am usually disappointed here in singapore we ordered pho special dac biet vietnamese assam laksa some goi cuon fresh rice paper rolls and a couple of drinks the goi cuon was good fresh with a great sauce pho was good probably best i have had so far in sg but still not melbourne good of course it was a damn sight better than the ridiculously overhyped overrated and overpriced namnam it was missing the depth and roundness of flavour that i love about pho generous with meats though i missed the bits of vietnamese sausage tripe and beef tendons that i have come to expect the assam laksa was a bit unusual complex flavours i was not a fan service was good friendly and fast  for two of us tables are literally   inches apart from each other so not the most pleasant ambience overall worth a try i just hope people stop going to namnam\",\"i would say bn tht nng is way better than nam nam i would prefer to have more herbs than cucumber though chicken pho also delicious with lotsa herbs soup is full of flavor vietnamese coffee was just ok not fragrant enough i love the small table outside the shop with stools so much like how the locals eat by the roadside in vietnam all in all food is pretty authentic and value for money\",\"great place to stop for lunch if you have limited time excellent pho quick service and friendly staff\",\"legitimately the best pho i have had in sg sample size of about  places definitely recommend standard pho fresh spring rolls and the lemonade always packed on a not so busy location so it has to be gud update do not get adventurous here the best thing on the menu is the pho trust me if you need more stick to spring rolls i have tried several items now although instill need to sample the chicken wings\",\"the grab driver told us that this is a smart choice for chilli crab because it is less expensive but better taste locals eat here when it is chilli crab mission the walk in q was scarily long but we were able to order while in line the food came out and every single dish that we ordered was delicious\",\"this place has a bit of a cult following so make sure you come early or call for reservations they do really good seafood and make a tasty chili salted egg or tanghoon crab the razor clams are good too the food is generally prepared singaporean chinese tze char style\",\"a local joint for crab not your regular chilly crabs my coworker took me there and we had claypot crab which is bit soupy butter crab and cereal shrimp everything was great except the wait yes we waited for an hour in line and then hour for food we got there at   and left at  so be prepared to wait and food will be worth it\",\"great seafood chili crab paper crab fish prawns they also serve meat vegetable and other dishes we a large group of more then  went all of us enjoyed the meal rank very high as a local chili crab and seafood place this is my rd visit\",\"two things to order crab bee hoon soup in claypot butter crab ok maybe add fried buns mantou you can skip the rest you are only here for the crabs nothing but crabs the bad is the long wait averaging   hours though it seemed like the wait is more   mins now even at pm on a thursday night the line was still there it only disappeared at pm you are warned make reservations though they do not take it during the  days of chinese new year now why the crabs the crab bee hoon soup is just very tasty the taste is similar to the fish bee hoon soup but this is sweeter and tastier the butter crab is to die for the butter cream is so tasty and perfect to dip the mantou in we had  crabs for  persons and it was just nice\",\"as everyone knows this is the best spot for crabs in singapore well this was the only spot i visited due to the amount of time i had here you can get crab cooked in different ways but the most popular is the chili crab and the fried mon taos seem to be popular and used to soak up the sauces and do not be like me trying to muscle through some of the crab pieces i ended up slicing my finger pretty bad ask for a cracker or something to get into it we ordered way too much food but my cousins wanted to try as much as we could since it was our last night the food was bomb but the price is super expensive i think the total came out to about  usd for the  of us we didnt make reservations but we only waited about  minutes for a table highly recommend you to try out if visiting singapore just make sure you dont eat and jet they have cameras and pictures of ppl who have done it before lmao\",\"finally visited mellben after years of everyone telling me that we should go firstly make reservations if not you will wait for a long time even with reservations you have to wait secondly know that this place is pricy if you are having crabs be prepared to drop a good dime here estimate about  for a medium crab good for  or  i think we got the butter crab and crab bee hoon crab bee hoon is the classic dish here and everyone gets it it is very good add more soup and bee hoon it is worth it the butter crab is good too and has a more heavy flavor and is also very creamy both were delicious the crabs are fresh and the meat is plentiful and succulent after all you are paying good money for these crabs the other side orders are good too we got rojak chicken tofu with pork floss and mushrooms and salted egg pork ribs the salted egg pork ribs were not very meaty unfortunately come here for crabs the crabs are so good it would have been  stars if it were not so pricey were less touristy and had a better reservation queue system\",\"i went there for dinner with my family i love their crab with the chilli sauce and claypot crab the bee hoon soup taste so good the place was quite hot because there is no air conditioner and u can get sweaty the cereal prawn is also good during the weekend or dinner time the queue can take up from  minutes to  hour conclusion recommended\",\"i thought this was the perfect place to experience singaporean cuisine as a tourist it is further away from touristy areas tucked away in a residential neighborhood we got the chili crab and fried fish in a spicy sauce both at market price that day the crab was  and the fish was  it was well worth it everything was delicious my husband and i were both pleased and our bellies were full\",\"this is one of the place you had to go when you are craving for crabs this is my nd visit here and i really love the way they cook the crabs here this outlet which i went is located at ang mo kio it is just located right below a hdb i went to this place on  separate occasion and it is always bustling with people there is a huge carpark located infront of the restaurant and fret not there is plenty of car lot but try to avoid popping by during dinner time as this is a residential area so car lot might be limited we order quite a number of dish that night and it was a treat by a friend therefore i cannot state the bill for the meal  signature crab beehoon soup  this is a must to try the broth make you go drooling and it is so flavourful as the beehoon and crab is cook together i always ask for extra portion of soup as it is really very good  salted egg yolk crab  anything cook with salted egg yolk is always so yummy the crab is coated with salted egg yolk and the flavour just blend in so well which keep your finger locking good butter crab  oh my the mantou really goes well with the butter sauce and the children keep dipping into the sauce with their mantou and crab i think this really tells you how good it is  cereal prawn  this is one of my all time favourite love the fragrant smell of the cereal and prawn they just simply blend in and the prawn is so crunchy if you ever pop by here pls order their signature crab beehoon soup trust me it is really very very good\",\"we brought our overseas guests here on a rainy saturday evening have warned them about the snaky q as we did not make any reservations but it wasnt that bad actually perhaps because of the rain we were seated down after about  mins our food arrived  mins later we had the crab with bee hoon soup butter crab chilli crab with fried mantous dough for drinks we had the fresh coconut  each our guests love this place declare it as the most delicious crab they have ever eaten in sg in their  week trip here they have tried at least  different places for crabs the place is full of tourists locals price is stated clearly size of the crabs check out the wall of fame in the restaurant this place is not air conditioned  of us shared  small crabs\",\"mellben is located under a hdb block in ang mo kio but because this restaurant been featured in some travel magazine this restaurant always pack with tourist so my suggestion will be make an effort to call and make a reservation  day before they are famous for their crab the most famous dish will be the crab beehoon rice noodles soup so you will see almost each table will have this dish the soup are very nice have a strong taste of crab freshness if you want more soup you may request for a bowl or two but they charge for each bowl or soup i also recommend that you try the butter and salted egg crab you might want to skip the chili crab personally i find it do not taste as good as lots of other restaurant in singapore the only problem i have with this restaurant is no aircon so get ready to sweat when enjoy those yummylious crab\",\"not used to the reservation system here in singapore or maybe it is just this restaurant very confusing and disorganized apparently once you are here for your reserved seat while waiting in line outside you can and should start going thru the menus and begin ordering but keep in mind this the restaurant is open to the court yard the  star is for the crab dishes other dishes are nothing special the  style rib are not bad meat are tender falls off the bone services is  or less stars we found an old lady as our server she is nice but does not speak much english other that seems to speak better english is always in a rush\",\"apparently this is where all the locals go great seafood it is not a fancy restaurant there is no ac but the food is delicious we had all things seafood cereal prawn kang kong two crabs one salted egg yum and the crab beehoon with the soup noodles get here early or expect a long queue everything is freshly cooked so it takes a little while as well for your food to be served\",\"the crab bee hoon soup was pretty bomb wish they had cracked more of the crab shell for us though also cereal prawns are a must order black pepper crab was pretty large and legit no wait at all since we got there a few minutes after they opened at pm interesting that they have a policy that states meat is not guaranteed in the crab what so what am i paying   for then luckily we had meat in our crab price was not as bad as i was expecting only pp for a table of  and we were pretty stuffed\",\"stars love this place about a  min walk from ang mo kio mrt but worth the trek officially my go to place when i have out of town visitors that need to try some chili crab the crabs are so meaty here and i learned to request for the male ones because the claws are bigger for those who think it is a hassle to eat crab and do not usually think it is worth the effort this place will change your mind i have also tried their famous crab bee hoon that comes in a claypot and actually like this better so if you have enough people try both flavors making reservations is also highly recommended\",\"best crab bee hoon and butter crab in singapore having been away from singapore for long periods at a time this is one place i always crave for the crab bee hoon is super flavorful with the broth having a strong sweetness from the crab the butter crab is heavenly and always leaves me licking my fingers the wait here is very long even on rainy weekdays so definitely do come early the place is pretty hard to get to via mrt so you gotta drive or cab or bus here you still have to wait for about an hour for take out because they cook your order on the spot and it takes about an hour for the crab bee hoon to be ready trust me the wait is worth it\",\"went here for dinner with my wife and long time friend we made a booking and confirmed it by phone when we arrived we had to order out in the street area we had a  month old with us but hey who cares the english is poor on everyone in fact they speak better english in mainland china the food was just ok for the price i expected a lot better razor clams were cold rice poorly cooked we spent around  best thing going for this place is the cheap beer\",\"get ready to get your fingers dirty for some delicious seafood this is a great place but a bit out of the way from the mrt stations you would have to take the red north south line to ang mo kio and either have a long walk or hail a taxicab but the location is prime because of the large space be prepared to wait though there are usually long lines here and a group of  of us had to queue for about   minutes pick up a menu and prepare to order while waiting in line so the wait for your food will not take as long once you are seated we ordered  small chili crabs  small butter crabs  medium signature crab soup bee hoon noodle soup jia mantao fried buns which are great for dipping in the chili or butter sauce and stirred fried vegetables this was the perfect amount for  of us having tried a lot of seafood from all over the world from maine lobster to scandinavian salmon to hawker centres across singapore this has definitely been one of the freshest and most tasty seafood experiences i have had we ended up pay about  singaporean dollars per person which is not bad at all the wait is long but it is worth it\",\"friends recommended this place they do not take reservations so the early arrival in evening could ease the pain of waiting in the long line we had salty egg crab and crab noodle soup the salty egg crab is deep fried and coated with salty egg sauce it is a genius combination if you love the nuance taste of salty egg crab noodle soup is amazingly delicious when drinking the soup it is like thousands of crabs dancing in the mouth although the crab is a little bit skinny not too much meat inside its flavor still captures my taste buds\",\"this restaurant was pretty good while on vacation in singapore stumbled across this restaurant looking for seafood cuisine i was a little nervous about the look of the restaurant and the fish crab lobster etc that were in the tanks however the food did not disappoint had the spicy crab dish and it was delicious also tried the jellyfish dish which was interesting haha the atmosphere of the restaurant was nice my dinner party sat outside and it was the perfect temperature lots of tables and people sitting outside you also have a nice view of the lagoon lake also it was situated in a place that had a boardwalk feel with tons of restaurants bars nightlife etc so it was very convenient took a taxi to the restaurant so not sure about parking\",\"if you visit singapore you need to go try this restaurant this place is delicious the restaurant is located by the river in clarke quay good location with a beautiful view there are tables inside the restaurant and outdoor seating as well tip i would suggest making online reservations ahead of time because this place is always busy and the wait time is insane jumbo is well known for their award winning chili crab which is amazing however i think their salted egg dishes were much tastier specially the stir fried with golden salted egg crab and the de shelled prawns fried with golden salted egg salted egg is not popular here in the u s so getting to try this in singapore was a yummy experience since there is sauce all over the crabs be prepared to get your hands messy the prices for their seafood is a bit expensive but the food is worth it i will be back here again the next time i visit singapore\",\"when i travel to a new country i make it a point to try the local dish when i found out that the specialty dish was chill crab i was ecstatic i love seafood and i especially love crab i researched best places to eat chill crab in singapore and this restaurant popped up among two others my coworker and i chose this one because it had riverside seating when i read reviews a lot of people mentioned that it was pricey i wish i would have researched that part a bit more cause i definitely got some sticker shock  per crab they are huge but it is still a lot of money was it worth it honestly yes i actually went to go eat one more before i left singapore i got the chili crab cause i like to try the typical traditional dish first the sauce was a tiny bit sweet which i was not crazy about at first but as i started to eat i loved it more my coworker order the pepper crab it was soooo much pepper they do not take cheap out on the black pepper my friend was suffering after awhile cause it was a bit too spicy for her these crabs do not come with any sides so i had to order a fried rice on the side overall i think we spent  on lunch crazy i know but hey how often do you get to eat chili crab in singapore the offered other seafood dishes as well if i could have afforded it i would have ordered more\",\"was referred to this place by a local for a hot spot for tourists and locals alike at first glance it looks poppin they have an automated electronic queue system to handle the big lines at their doors i was hopeful howeveri have had chili crab before by the bay and others and this was extremely disappointing presentation was good the meal altogether was mediocre at best you have to order the rice and fried buns traditional sides chili crab comes with a la carte to me it did not taste fresh the fried shrimp was oddly a little soggy and the crab was practically glued to the shell something i have never experienced before the taste was good but you are definitely better off getting crab by the bay better pricing for way better food it was very clear that they were understaffed as the service was terrible none of the food came out at the same time the waiter kept forgetting what we asked for and they do not have napkins it took nearly  minutes after we ate for someone to come and clear the check the interior was a mess on the surface level it looks clean and nice however the front desk was loaded w a hodgepodge full of random stuff trash was overflowing inside the storage for the restaurant was clearly visible the bathroom was atrocious and the only was to get though to it was through a hall behind the kitchen a cook and i almost ran into each other on the way out from the bathroom gross jumbo is definitely a bit of a tourist trap and if you are in the mood for chili crab and cannot go for i guess it would suffice but personally i do not think it represents the dish to its full potential\",\"we wanted to try chili crab and we heard that this place was a great place to try it at plus it was right on the water in clarke quay we showed up without reservations around pm and there was no wait for us we asked to be seated by the water and the host said ok no problem as we walked to the table the hostess informed us that we would need to be finished by  pm the place was packed and we were seated next to the walk way and the garbage dirty dish area we asked again and were pretty much ignored as the wait staff yelled at one another over us the service itself is not that great so remember to focus why you are there in the first place to try the chili crab we ordered kg of mud crab to be cooked in the chilli style they have other ways to prepare it but we stuck with what singapore is famous for singaporeans also consider this to be one of their national dishes we also ordered the salted egg prawns our order came out pretty quickly it was a nicely presented mud crab in a dish of chilli type sauce the great news is that most of the crab is already pre cracked and broken apart making this much easier and quicker to eat the flavor did not disappoint it was a nice red sauce that had a slight heat mixed in with the sweet if i had known better i would have ordered some bread to soak up the sauce but we were so full we did not need it the salted egg prawn was delicious it is basically a tempura shrimp dusted in some sort of sweet salt it was delicious overall we spent about usd and had good food with a terrible spot in the restaurant and pretty poor service\",\"super expensive right across clarke quay with a great view of the river definitely a tourist spot but the food is really good thier signature was the chili crab and when you order it you will know why almost licked that plate clean everything else was delicious too so i dont think you can go wrong with picking anything here you eat the chilicrab with your hands and they provide bibs like the crab shrimp spot boiling crab as well as food grade gloves upon request this place does fall into some tourist traps though they come by to leave peanuts but do not tell you that they will charge it on your bill you only have a limited time before you are ushered out to seat more guests and the water is charged as well though to be fair it is bottle water flagging down a waiter to get anything was incredibly difficult where at one point two tables next to us were waiting to get thier bill trying to flag someone down as well overall a pretty nice spot to impress tourists pricey but next to the lively night scene of clarke quay had chili crab for the first time here and it was finger licking good\",\"make a reservation if you can it gets pretty busy we had to wait around  mins to be seated for  people on a monday night at  pm and when we were finally called and seated we were told we had to vacate our table by  pm having said that they did not force us off the table when  pm came round there were other tables becoming available and figured they did not need ours in too mush of a rush the service itself is not that great so remember to focus why you are there in the first place for the chili crab we ordered kg of crab to be cooked in the chilli style they offer other cooking style but we stuck with what singapore is famous for and ordered a few of the fried dough bun great for dipping in the chilli sauce or you can order rice which i saw on other tables and the dish did not disappoint it was not spicy at all and i do not do spicy it had a slight heat mixed in with the sweet the crab was very meaty and made it easy to enjoy the dish as a whole also ordered the lobster g glass noodle in clay pot this dish i could have done without the lobster was over done and the flavour was lacking when ate alongside the chili crab i found myself dipping the lobster meat into the chilli sauce the cost of the chilli crab was reasonable at s  for the kg crab we had but the s  g lobster was disappointing i would wished i ordered the prawn dishes instead\",\"if you come to singapore you have to try some good seafood teochew and hokkien cooking really knows how to take seafood to the next level that you wo not find anywhere else in the world behold the famous singaporean chili black pepper crab we ordered also the baby squid taro scallop salted egg shrimp and pork alongside a feast for a king for sure worth the money if you love high end bougie hearty stuff this is located right by the quay so you get lovely scenery and the bar scene is super nice at night after you are done great pics of the skyline of singapore from here as well pork goodness ribs done to the next level savory sweet and covered with the satisfying almond crunch on top great way to kick off our meal baby squid taste of sweet sesame over crunchy but still slightly chewy squid baby squid is tender and having each individual squid per bite is so different from rings or calamari in my opinion the texture and taste is sweet and naturally tender taro scallop if you love taro then you gotta try teochew or singaporean version of taro it is usually fried until aromatic paired with some coconut milk and gingko nuts at the end of a high end meal this is to the next level they deep fried it with these large succulent scallops in the middle holy cow if this is not some delicious rich stuff then idk what else is salted egg shrimp does this meal get better or what salted egg is such a unique thing to singapore they even started a salted egg crusted fish skin as local potato chips which are also deliciously sinful forget about popcorn shrimp you use egg yolks as the crust holy cow my arteries are crying but in joy would do it again salty rich and not super crunchy and overly salty like a potato chip this is a worth it dish to get and now the chili crab bro prepare to get your hands dirty b c the point of this dish is to finish that sauce that the crab has taken time to brew and stew in the crab is delicious but that chili paste that this thing has been cooking in is a complexly layered seafood chili thing that you must dip the sweet bun into better not leave any sauce left b c it is worth like  a bite on this dish and the sauce is excellent worth getting this take a stroll down clarke is quay afterwards for a neon lights reflecting on the water chill bars and the singapore marina sands hotel reflecting across the waterways\",\"skip it although the location is nice service was poor and the food just ok when we were seated we were given  minutes before we had to vacate our table we ordered an appetizer noodle dish and a steamed fish the fish were priced by the g our waiter was quite reluctant to inform us about anything other than the larger portions available the noodles came in about  minutes but the appetizer was no where in sight another  minutes later we cancelled it  minutes into our wait the noodles were cold by now we asked about our fish and asked again about  minutes later finally got it in another  the sauce it was cooked in was nice but the fish was dry and lacked much flavor it was just ok given the poor service long wait times and high prices they also tack on additional charges to the menu prices on your bill maybe that was disclosed on the menu but i did not see it it was a lot of money for a disappointing experience there is so much great food in singapore unfortunately we did not find any here we did a lot better overall at hawker stalls\",\"it started out good service was attentive but after first course it was crickets had to flag down several staff to get more hot water for tea finally got all the food delivered kind of strange and disappointed with lamb they were plated individually and had a brown sauce on it food was only okay had better not really worth the  especially when in the end i had diarrhea\",\"what a lovely place to eat crab the three nights we stayed in singapore we had dinner here two nights both times we ordered the chili crab the staff was very helpful recommending the size of crab because the price is not cheap one crab for two people can easily cost you close to a hundred bucks highly recommend if you like crabs\",\"a very busy place lucky we made a reservation and selected to eat in air conditioning comfort we loved the chilli crab with the fried and steam buns to soak up the yummy sauce the cereal prawns were crispy and sweet lots of leftover crumbs to enjoy an expensive meal compared to other restaurants serving similar food service was average so do not forget to take your own tissues they only provide the wet wipes enjoy the yummy crab\",\"must order  chilli crab salted egg crab if you cannot take spicy chilli  salted egg fish skin salted egg prawns spinach with century egg salted eggbefore ordering any crab double check with the staff what is the pricing for the crabs on nd jan  the pricing was  per kg i ordered a salted egg crab and asked for the smallest size the staff told me it was g and i agreed but when the bill came they charged us  and i queried the staff and the staff said the crab that was sent to my table was indeed g then i asked why was i charged  he apologised and reprinted the bill with a   discount so beware when you get the bill that the pricing of the crab reflects the weight of the crab that you ordered the salted egg fish skin is freshly fried upon order and hence it is way better than any of the pre packaged junk food that you get at convenience stores or supermarkets always make a reservation i called up and they told me that they were fully booked and that i had to walk in i did not give up and found jumbo listed on chope a reservation website and managed to make a pm booking on chope i witnessed a caucasian couple walk in and they were told it was a  hour waiting time on a wednesday night\",\"the chili crab was one of the must try food if singapore it was creamy and just the right amount of spice the crab was cooked well and the atmosphere by the water was great the crab was prepared well and made easy to eat because the crab shell was already cracked the salted shrimp was by far salty yet very tasty and i finished the entire bowl of shrimp i recommend making a reservation since the restaurant can be very busy and the wait time for walk in may seem too long\",\"the place is an awesome seafood place this place is not for the faint hearted because the prices here is probably one of the most expensive seafood place in singapore but let me tell you it is worth every penny the food talks for itself\",\"not cheap but this is my go to place for chilli crab in the city if you are visiting singapore everyone will tell you that you have to try chili crab before you leave their other seafood dishes are tasty as well last time i was here i came in a large group and dinner came out to be about  sgd pp including beers they get busy so come early or call ahead to make a reservation\",\"you know you have had a good dinner date when you had to call your girlfriend and tell her how good it was me girl i think i had the best dinner date that i had in awhile i had a date with cc and damn was he good girlfriend girl really i wanna hear all about it tell me me girl he was a little small you know what they say about those little ones right but he was packing and all the right places honey and he was hard as a shell but i sure did not mind cracking him open now let is not forget about the good old taste my friend did cece taste good me girl did he he was so flavorful and delicious i know people were staring at me sucking all over him but i just could not help myself especially when it was time to get to that good ol meat oh lord that was the best part all i had to do was use my hands let is just say i left very pleased and satisfied jumbo seafood has the best chilli crab cc i ever ate in my life i have been hearing so much about jumbo that i just had to try it for myself as i was in town and i am happy i did i arrived on my last day of singapore at around  p m an hour before they close staff welcomed me with open arms and set me outside i ordered the chilli crab signature crab dish and fried rice with eggs also do not forget to get there mini buns so you can suck up all the juice from the crab beware they will place nuts on your table that are not complimentary you actually pay for those if u do not want it send it back once i noticed i was paying for them i kindly asked them to remove the nuts off the table and off my bill yeah i know many people talk about how expensive this place is but honestly it is all worth it fortunately i was able to get a  discount as they were offering that to any citibank participants if you have citibank make sure you bring your card beat the crowds and come at night especially to enjoy the lovely view of clarke quay this is a must when visiting singapore until next time cc emoji happy face\",\"i have watched so many tv shows introducing this restaurant when they travel to singapore since chili crab is one of the must eat foods in singapore so i had to try to save time be sure to make reservation on line or expect long wait chili crab s price is market price and normally around   dollars for  kg in additional to chili crab i ordered prawn with cereal fried baby squid mini bun steam rice and tiger beer baby squid is perfect side dish to eat with beer prawn with cereal does not seem like it goes well but it does and delicious you can eat it as is or peel of the prawn shells and eat with cereal be sure to finish them first when hot it does not taste good when cold my main dish chili crab can be messy since you have to break the shells using your hands taste is not good as i expected so many people praise this food and i really had huge expectations about this food it was delicious but not as good to praise it i would not eat again since value of this dish is too high compare to taste one time to try it out is enough for me as a tip best way to eat chili crab is dip the mini bun and eat or mix it with steam rice and eat be careful with the things they offer since it is not free when you are seated they will come with tea and peanut as they give to you as free of charge if you accept them you will be charged also you will see small orange wet towel packet once you use it it will be charged\",\"i rarely use the term must try but when in singapore there are indeed two local specialties that every visitor should try the first one is the world famous singapore chili crab a whole large crab already cut into pieces and with the shells cracked open was served in a wok shaped dish filled with the world is yummiest chili sauce the heat of the chili was moderate which i think was enough to give the dish a good kick without being overwhelming it was more of a sweet chili sauce that had a tasty and soothing sweetness that was perfect for my palate using the red hot chili pepper scale that many restaurants use i would say it was probably   chili peppers the sauce was very rich in the natural flavor of the crab meat and it is a perfect companion of the fried rice that we ordered i could eat that fried rice with the chili sauce all day every day the crab itself was meaty juicy and packed with natural yumminess of the sea wear a bib get your hands messy and dirty and savor every bite of the meat that you manage to extract out of the shells besides the chili crab we also ordered a mango and roast duck appetizer the app was a cold salad made with hand pulled or shredded roast duck meat slices of fresh mango and baby cucumbers it was tossed in a sweet and slightly tangy asian vinaigrette that was close to heavenly there are plenty of places in singapore where you can find the famous chili crab but if you are in the gorgeous vibrant and somewhat romantic clarke quay area jumbo is the place to go\",\"the chili crab is legendary here and the view over the canal to clarke quay is beautiful thumbs up\",\"finally managed to make it here on a weekend at noon the broth is really flavorful maybe a little too rich actually the noodles are excellent and absorb the soup really nicely the rest of the ingredients are par for the course quite reasonably priced at  a bowl likely one of the best ramen places in singapore taking a star off for the long queues and lack of card payment\",\"came here on a thursday at approximately  am it was pretty empty and was ushered to seat on the commune table as i was on my own without much hesitation i ordered the tonkotsu ramen with flavored egg and without black fungus for beverage i ordered green tea cola food came within  minutes the broth was not as rich in flavor as i would like it to be the noodles were in between of soft and hard and it delivered like what others commented this place can get crowded during peak hours and it was difficult to head out after meals service was inconsistent and price wise was reasonable overall i still prefer their kani king chain\",\"this is to me the best ramen in town been eating here for  years and never being dissapointed a part from queue for quite long in the peak time everything is great\",\"this the oldest and most popular outlet of the ramen keisuke chain it is located at the orchid hotel next to the another well known japanese restaurant teppei the outlet is very small with limited dine in area seats are very close to each other do take note that only cash payment is accepted here there is no nets or credit card payment available here similar to other outlets there was free flow hard boiled eggs and marinated bean sprouts to help yourself to there was also sesame seeds to add flavour to the ramen one could customize the ramen as similar to other outlets the table was very small barely had enough space for the food and the condiments on it tonkotsu ramen   the pork soup base was rich and creamy one would also add the grounded sesame seeds and bonito flakes to the ramen for a stronger flavour the dish was such as pick me up for a cold night that one would forget about dining in such a small narrow table\",\"there are already lots of positive reviews already my experience here agree with their findings we had the spicy ramen with everything and the black ramen without everything i ate  eggs and my gf ate  eggs i ate almost halve of the free beansprouts too i am not sure if they made my money this time but i sure did enjoy my meal tonight i hope they remain in business so i can come back again\",\"i was there around  pm and there were about  person in front of me waited less than  mins not bad the size of the shop is not big people tends not to sit long like other reviews mentioned unlimited supply of free boiled eggs and bean sprouts you cannot eat much anyway i have ordered a tonkotsu king ramen with seaweed the noodle texture is just right and the taste of the soap is good not too oily i did not give  stars because the soup is not hot temperature enough service is excellent very polite i was impressed by though quite a bit of people queuing outside they still kept refilling the water and no intention to kick you out after you finished most of us very discipline eat and go i will come back to this ramen place next time worth to try if you never been there\",\"you need to get lucky when you visit keisuke as there is always an endless queue at this place during meal times and working in the area i attest to that personally as someone who has witness these queues for the last year or so there is not a walk to the mrt station at the end of the day that i do not see a snaking queue outside this outlet i got lucky on two separate occasions in fact once at lunch and the second time at dinner today i say lucky because while there was a queue the wait was not too long we is kipped the queue during lunch because we had a table for our smaller group size opened up at dinner today we did have to wait for a bit minutes but again were lucky to skip past a group in front of us so my tip here would be to go only in groups of  the shop is rather small so they have more  seaters which gives you a higher chance of a shorter wait i tried both the red spicy and black spicy tonkotsu noodles on the respective visits added all ingredients in the red and just an additional egg for the black cause dinner needs to be a small meal p i have to say that while i loved both soup bases their chashu is rather inconsistent i loved the melt in your mouth piece that i got at dinner compared to the  rather tendon filled tough pieces that i got when i went for lunch i think it is again all about luck when you done here depending on the day etc because the same happened for my egg japanese ramen eggs are notoriously awesome because of its yolk consistency at least for it it is and the egg that i had at lunch was disappointing because it was more hard boiled than runny my colleague on the other hand had a perfectly runny egg but i guess that was redeemed by the egg that i got when i went for dinner they had free hard boiled eggs at the table as well as marinated bean sprouts that i would definitely recommend everyone to try i guess for quite a number of people this is a highlight though i would not concur as most of the ramen places in the tanjong pagar area have this free hard boiled egg perk the food here is really good when you get lucky which is why the  stars it lacks consistency in both the broth my dinner partner had been here before but he had horrible tasting broth when we went for dinner his feedback was that it was a lot better than his first try and their ingredients which i feel is really sad because every visit could be a hit or miss keisuke tonkotsu has a sister branch nearby in am serving the ramen with a chicken based broth instead which i hope to go try someday\",\"came here for a late lunch so avoid the long queue yay saw that they actually provided free barley for customers who are waiting in line to help themselves to they even left several fans in case it get too hot that is nice i ordered black spicy ramen the broth was thick and savory i opted for the noodle as normal texture so that is nice for me the soup was not spicy at all just a hint of it the pork slices were thick and flavourful but a little tough i opted for additional flavour egg and it was good soft seasoned at the yoke free beans sprout i thought it would be plain boiled bean sprouts but i was surprised to find a small jar of bean sprout goodness left on the table for your own service their bean sprouts were boiled and seasoned with sesame spicy oil and something yummy i only know i cannot stop eating that i wanted to whack the free eggs too but was way too full from the free bean sprouts to do so will return if in the area just to whack the bean sprouts again\",\"ate here several times even before yelp was created and now that i have eaten it i am reminded of yelping and thus here is my review you can read the rest of the reviews they are largely accurate except for the criticism maybe they had blocked nose and hence their sense of taste went haywire haha i would say that i have never tasted any broth as thick and flavorful as keisuke is orchid hotel in singapore in addition you get to have a multi sensory experience space is cramped a la japan you crush some sesame seeds and the aroma fills the shop technically you should go in eat fast and get out fast similar to japan correct me if i am wrong of course you can eat slowly to spend more time in the shop but why deprive others of their noodles dtldr broth thick noodle ramen qq springy meat is nice one of the best ramens i have ever eaten and for that price yeaaaaa\",\"we came here on a friday afternoon around pm and the place was not very busy at that time we were quickly seated and given a checklist menu to order our ramen i had the classic tonkotsu king ramen with the flavored egg and the normal authentic japanese taste as stated on menu while we waited there was a large bowl of hard boiled eggs for us to eat this is what my gf remembered as her favorite thing about this place when the ramen came out the broth was deliciously rich and thick definitely the best part of the ramen the noodles were good as was the soft boiled flavored egg i was expecting a little more sides and the chasyu was not served the way i normally like it i like mine melt in your mouth soft but it was ok would definitely come back and try their spicy ramen on a next visit to singapore i liked the green tea cola in a bottle as well\",\"my favorite ramen in singapore the bowls are not perfect perfect ramen should have perfect broth noodles charsiew and keisuke only gets   of these down pat but it is never disappointed me since i was first brought here  years ago speaking of the   things this chain of keisuke and likely the others as well though i can only speak for paya lebar bugis village branches has such deliciously milky and rich broth their menu is simple with the original or black pepper or red pepper chili oil versions i ordered the black version but i honestly do not see much difference between them they are both really good the noodles are also great al dente not too soft not too chewy delicious it is not the sapporo style ones that resemble instant ramen but the straight cut hakata style just like ippudo is if you have a bigger eater definitely order extra ramen for a few bucks also i did not list the flavored egg as one of my criteria for perfect ramen since its pretty much a basic pre requisite keisuke is is perfect and hits the spot the charsiew is a little meh nothing special the little extra perk that keisuke offers is the free flow bean sprouts salad hard boiled eggs some people go really crazy on the hard boiled eggs and i do not really understand why but to each his own i am a huge fan of the bean sprouts they taste slightly spicy and sweet and are so addictive i gulp down whole bunches of these with my noodles i am not kidding sometimes i literally finish half the container at my table kind of strange but this is definitely one of my favorite things about keisuke\",\"nearly perfect blend of flavor and spice being a food simpleton i tried the spicy red ramen with none of the extra accouterments i wish the broth had a slightly more pork fat taste but i had a hard enough time finishing it as it came because i stuffed myself silly like the good little tourist i am on peanuts from long bar while i waited  minutes for my drink i am giving  stars because i specifically requested a medium pork fat flavor expecting the strong option to overwhelm the spice i regret that decision but it was still a mighty fine bowl of ramen my first in  months thanks keisuke\",\"yelp brought me here i was in sg on holiday and was excited to see sg on yelp i walked here from where i stayed at in clarke quay i waited a good  mins in line and it prob would have been a longer wait if i was eating with someone party of  i counted about  chairs so it is small hence the long line you preorder on paper while waiting so when you get seated your order comes right out i am not a ramen fan but i did eat everything i had the original with everything what i did not like was the customer service no one came to fill up my water what is up with that i guess they are too busy trying to flip tables if you are in sg and love ramen come here but come early to avoid the long line\",\"any day can be a ramen day for me i have been returning for many good bowls of delicious hot ramen in this store the only irks is you have to share those tiny tables and the space is rather tight hence the line is long at times but come early to avoid it pros free bean sprouts and hard boiled eggs for allsapporo bottled beer available hereayataka green tea available herethe pork broth is goodthe egg is delicious that comes at cons you gotta pay by either cash or nets credit card is not available here\",\"welp what a disappointment but let is start with what went well the broth is great and is how a good tonkotsu broth should be thick rich and extremely flavorful for all  types normal black peppery spicy and red chilli spicy the oils ground sesame seeds went well with it the noodle was nice and firm the portion of meat was great for   it came with all the good sides including   big slices of pork and that is exactly when things went to crap those big slices of pork oh they held so much promise but the first warning sign came when i noticed that any signs of the good ole usual layers of fats seem to be missing strange maybe they were using a lean cut but nope biting into it was like gnawing into a gunny sack dry oh god so tough flavorless it was awful enough to spoil the meal for me i guess the chef has clearly way way waaaay over cooked the meat making it extra tough and dry and of course melting all the fats away in short i would sorta recommend this place if you are vegetarian and looking for some great ramen and broth however if you like me find the pork to be an extremely integral part of a good tonkotsu ramen i would recommend you stay far far away\",\"a solid choice i took the japanese style ramen and it does taste like ramen in japan the concept with the all you can eat eggs is nice a great value for money place\",\"cash only i find that the portion is too little esp the noodles for extra portion its the noodles tasted great and the broth tasty small joint with usually a crowd for lunch we were suppose to line up with the other establishment but we just decided to come here due to long wait on the other side\",\"my friend brought me to this place keisuke tonkotsu king for ramen recently what attracted me the most was the free flow of soft boiled eggs guys like me who are training up their body would need the extra protein boost the shop is rather small in scale but it makes the environment much more cozy queue is also quite long so people who want to go try the food should go early the soup is thick and full of flavor noodles are just nice and of large portion\",\"one major complaint this place is way too small we were here right at pm when they opened and we managed to walk in straight away but the tiny space filled up almost immediately even before our noodles are served free flow of hard boiled eggs bean sprouts at each table is a nice touch but note that you do get a perfect onsen egg in your ramen so i would advise against bring too greedy with the free eggs ramen i prefer the original to the black broth the black version has a spiciness that reminds me of sichuan spice and i feel that it took away the sweetness of the amazing tonkotsu broth i would only go for the original next time the pork slice is nothing compared to santouka i did not finish mine order original with extra firm noodles and less oil that is my perfect bowl of ramen plus thank you yelp for finally allowing reviews to be posted via mobile app\",\"delicious delicious i love good ramen and i am so happy my friend recommended keisuke i opted for the spicy black king which was delicious i have had other ramen with black broth ramen dojo in san mateo ca but this one has a different flavor it is more black pepper y when they say spicy it is pepper spicy not chili oil burn your mouth spicy boiled eggs and bean sprouts are also offered at the table so eat up\",\"great ambiance and well extracted coffee\",\"not really a fan of the food here pastries can be really dried out sometimes breakfast offerings too sweet coffee is uniformly terrific though especially the filter brews\",\"overall i enjoyed my experience at cshh it is a quaint coffee shop and great for a quick bite i ordered the salmon toastie which was great they food was presented well and tasted good my only issue was the cold brew nitro coffee on tap i have had nitro beers and coffees before however this one was a bit flat other than that no complaints i would definitely return again for the food and maybe opt for a different drink instead\",\"been to this place second time do not be duped by the hardware shop from outside it is a cool place for coffee and beer not many choice for dinner but they are all delicious i like their salmon donburi the price is slightly high but the ambience is cool\",\"it is interesting to witness what is going on at jalan besar and its vicinity the neighbourhood is slowly changing hardware stores and workshops for cool hostels galleries and coffee shops chye seng huat hardware coffee is the perfect example of this process the building used to house hardware companies now it is a coffee bar gallery and roastery it is so hip it makes me feel like i am back on mexico city is ultra hipster neighbourhoods it has a very cool atmosphere complete with a turntable for vinyls actually they just plug a tablet into it but i would like to think it works industrial style benches free lo fi newspapers and a colourful friendly staff at the coffee bar they sell amazing coffee the cold brews are very good served in cute medicine bottles they even have cold brewed coffee on tap which is fresh and tasty i also tried an earl grey cheese cake which was superb prices are not surprisingly higher than on any average kopitiam but lower than most of those corporate coffee shops we all know so well some people admit it most of us do not but we all have a tiny little hipster deep inside us and that tiny little hipster loves this kind of coffee bars so why not embrace the hip and treat ourselves with high quality coffee this is a place worth visiting repeatedly\",\"for the coffee lovers pretty basic with their coffee menu does have quite a good pastry cake selection even pastas and rosti as well was pretty satisfied with my latte though i would have preferred them to have syrup on their selfservice condiments counter i like my coffee sweet their lemonade was really well made too like a fizzy mojito without the alcohol the ambience and facade of a hardware store was also very interesting\",\"from the same roaster as papa palheta also the roaster is name pulp and loysel is toy and the coffee here is the same quality but in a cooler and more hipster like setting of an old hardware store here they have a very nice cafe part as well as a roasting and tasting annex and some outdoor seating the coffee is good without being spectacular but the presentation of the filter coffee is very nice when they serve in cute little bottles the espresso based coffees are also good and the cakes and pastries are too good to not eat one or two or occasionally even more the food is standard cafe fare and i have been rather underwhelmed by the quality so would come here for the coffee the cakes and nice setting service is usually friendly and if you sit sit the bar it tends to be more talkative one drawback is the lack of free wifi but perhaps intentional to not have people sit around for too long\",\"super cute little cafe really wonderful coffee and pastries the ambience and service was amazing great little hipster pocket in the city my only complaint would be that they did not have soy or almond milk will definitely be back for craft beer and pizza at night\",\"reviewing the evening bar not the coffee i am sure papa palheta deserves their reputation but i am firmly in the nylon camp the beers were expensive as expected and nothing special my amber ale tasted like tiger with food colouring the special was a low alcohol lager infused with mandarin peel and tasted just like it sounded but it was to be fair  a pint there were only  choices and i wanted none of them i suspect there were bottled beers on offer one of the staff was sipping some but without a menu or any kind of visibility it would be hard to order them just down the road are char and  the former serves hobgoblin and the latter has decent home brews better options if beer is what you are after the dj is volume was too high so the evening ended in sore throats it is strange because there is no dance floor nor dancing at around pm the dj changed and the sound was pushed even higher at this point we were screaming at each other gave up after  minutes and moved on the place seems to be a lbgt cruising spot and at least a third of the audience was visibly lbgt as well as many on the staff the food looked like normal pub food fries mac n cheese etc i would rather eat at the numerous hawkers in fact that is what we did young and hipster crowd mostly many fashionable ang mohs loads of selfies and instagram maybe i am getting old\",\"no hardware but they take their coffee very seriously and fun industrial feel wild mushroom pasta is excellent and the tuna salad is ok seating is limited and place is humming with hipsters and early thirty something is cold nitro coffee on tap is exactly what it sounds like but no alcohol worth a visit for sure\",\"cshh coffee shop is quaint and boutique coffee is awesome and the cakes have good selections they even have nintendo games from year s era we will be back highly recommended for a first date meet\",\"other reviews have covered all the basics the roastery the annex the food pastries and the like although few ever mention the small indie style shop on the second floor of the building offering small batch personal and home items the second floor gallery space is perfect for a lazy afternoon browse after enjoying a coffee and a spot of lunch at chye seng huat hardware while there are few other similarly designed spaces in singapore such as a r c or roasting their own beans such as common man and nylon the chye seng huat hardware space is my by far my favorite even if you do not opt for a baked good just a block away is the broadway hawker center ready to fill your post coffee tummy\",\"food is average but coffee here is very good the reataurant looks like a hardware store from outside but it is a huge coffee thing inside beside the drink and food area there is a coffee selling shop inside a coffee making class on the second floor would def try the coffee making class when i have time\",\"cold brew coffee was spot on strong smooth and served ice cold it was perfect space is very cool industrial vibes galore menu looks very unique and cool large display of sweet treads by the till the earl grey cheesecake looks yummy staff are informative and very friendly wish i lived near by\",\"i will give it a  star for the conversion of a heritage building to a spacious cafe with micro roaster this cafe attracts both locals coffee enthusiast and expats on a weekend brunch as much as i love the space coffee wise it is too watery and milky for my liking\",\"quite simply one of the better coffee places you can find in singapore the baristas take great pride in make the coffee just note i am not a fan of their nitro coffee thing the one where they brew their beer like a stout i would keep away if i were you\",\"first time here and love it the service was very good everybody seems always in the mood i love my latte which had similar taste with tiong bahru bakery or penny university dont know if they are using the same beans the barista lady gave me different latte art yes i ordered  cuppa the french toast was delish i am not eating pork and i asked for a plain omelette and they kindly made it for my son with no hassle overall it was great i can see my self going back here soon\",\"it is my go to place for coffee it serves the best coffee here love the snacks as well\",\"walked straight passed chyesenghuathardware the first time super cute coffeebar their mini espresso with milk is a perfectpiccolo breakfast menu could use  or  lighter options which is how i ended up having delicious warm toasted banana bread with tdf espressobutter and coffee icecream because that is not heavy or rich at all for breaky if you are into the pourover definitely check out this place they take it very seriously singapore singaporefood sgfood cshh cakes burple\",\"i love this place i was told by a local to come here and i was not disappointed this is coffee roasting at its finest complete with a coffee bar to enjoy your favorite brew and some delicious homemade snacks as well i had a flat white perfectly blended with some curry puffs both were delicious and the price is on par with other coffee shops in singapore except this one was top notch do not expect a place like this to ever be empty if you want a seat you will be waiting and or jumping in front of someone to take it but the ambiance is cool the music was nice and it was a great place to hangout i ended up buying some beans here from their own blend again the prices being very reasonable   sgd a bag against the usa and other singapore coffee shops i must say the area throws you off a bit it appears to be in a residential area with hardware stores around but the area is for sure in the process of changing do not expect free wifi as in many places in singapore since they do not want people camping out here for the day however clean toilets and free water abound\",\"little india is great for those of us who are old enough to remember what singapore used to be like this is the last area where you can truly get a glimpse of what singapore used to be the streets of little india are stocked full of all kinds of everything little india has probably the best outdoor food market in all of singapore you can really get some great items to prepare your next meal plus there are tons of shops that offer clothing jewelry and pretty much the everything else of singaporean indian culture also there are a couple of great religious shrines located in little india at night little india truly comes to life it is really a great place to walk among the people see the lights of the shops the lights that are on the streets and truly experience singaporean east indian culture if you do nothing else in singapore you must come to little india\",\"little india is so colorful and full of yummy food stalls i like to come here to enjoy colorful buildings and some of the curry my favorite here is fish head curry it is like a trip to india without actually flying there price of the goods are okay perhaps what i saw was per negotiation price i was tempted to buy a tradition indian dress as they looked nice i did not get one as i was still traveling and when i think through it where can i really wear them anyway dress was that pretty it made me consider purchasing one on this particular time a stranger bought me a lily flower to put on my hair another person came up to me after i put flower on my fair that i was doing it wrong and fixed it for me flower smelled so good i put flower by my bed after i got back to my hotel and it smells good all night long\",\"a must go for those who want to explore a little bit more a different kind of town i made it here by train and i walked around as i enjoyed the many foods flowers and all types of vendors you can find in here from vegetables to fruits flowers accessories clothes and so much more the color and smells were the highlights of the afternoon as i expected they also have a huge food court inside a place next to the train station with soooo many places to choose from it was a shame that i had breakfast before i went because i was full and i could not try anything but the smell of the food was so good that i end up taking some sweets back to the hotel with me\",\"living in the us there are not many cities that have indian neighborhoods especially not miami my home or tucson current residence so being in singapore and walking around in this neighborhood brought back some good old memories from back in the day when i was still in pakistan it is a street of several blocks full of indian markets including clothes random accessories delicious food stalls and restaurants to name a few things there is a mall type building that had some great food stalls where we got some bomb biryani and samosas and then after walking around for a while had to control myself from shopping ate dinner at bbq tonite that as mentioned in another review was delicious if i were to live in singapore this would be a regular street for me to visit for some good food and shopping\",\"pretty cool neighbourhood with a ton of shops lots of gold perfume and other knick knacks i came across an outdoor food centre as well but did not have grab a bite as there is to many good restaurants in singapore and i got way to much food before getting here i did not realize how large the area would be but there is a cool arch at one of the entrances\",\"i am all about experiencing everything for myself and discovering thus creating my own unbiased opinion through firsthand experiences i love experiencing different cultures and adventures and emerging myself into how locals live this place was bustling with people and vendors although there were not many things to look at or explore and many of the alleys were a tad dirty many travel books and online search suggest this area as a must but i would have been ok if we skipped it\",\"wow first stop of our singapore trip and this places is so indian and asian getting food was a bit of a struggle but we found a big market with meat and fish as well as food stalls meals start at  sgd a set the entire area feels a bit dirty but overall it is an interesting place to go to especially if you are nearby\",\"lots of indian shops with lots of heritage they sell lots of interesting items and food that are related to the indian culture it was very enlightening for me to check out little india\",\"there are so many things to see in little india even just walking the streets so many things to watch and observe i have been to chinatown japanese town little tokyo koreatown little italy little saigon etc but seeing little india for the first time just amazing their colorful decoration in the entrance caught my attention also two huge colorful elephants are something you do not want to miss the streets are filled with gold retail stores i never knew india people are into gold not only jewelry stores restaurants gift shops fruit vegetables store unique colorful buildings are just amazing only thing i did not like was too many people homeless in the park they did not look like ordinary people since hairs was all messy dirty clothes sitting and laying down on ground freely as i walk near everyone was starring at me and little scary i see no harm in them but just felt uncomfortable spending  hrs in little india allow me to understand little more about their lifestyle and culture\",\"i love exploring ethnic enclaves in cities across the globe i think it just gives me a better perspective on how immigrants establish themselves in other countries now singapore is of course a melting pot of cultures so a visit to little india should definitely be a stop on your tour around the city there are many restaurants and shops throughout the tight neighborhood but i feel that to truly get a sense of the culture you must eat where the locals eat i try to stay away from other tourists so i delve deep into little india to see what it is all about i found so many shops selling anything and everything which really did not help my wallet but aside from the shopping just experiencing this enclave in singapore made me feel as if i was actually in india the hop on hop off tour buses stop by this place and i believe you should as well\",\"nice place to visit when you are in singapore there is a food area a market where you can find fresh seafood fruits vegetables etc in the upper section they have lots of clothing and even tailors it was wonderful to see some ladies in their traditional sarees\",\"i understand it is a cultural thing but give people space to look be aware of this if you have space issues not all of the places where so intrusive of personal space but some of the men need to check there hormones and leave the girls alone it just creepy when they are standing so close they are touching you\",\"fantastic place to see all ethnic groups eating in one place albeit sectioned off muslim halal no pork eat with your right hand fingers hindu no cows chinese singaporean eat anything there is always a place to wash your hands so do not be afraid to eat with your fingers like the locals it took a couple of days to get the curry chili tattoo off my fingers\",\"my only regret is forgetting to buy the lovely indian saree here september  not only are the prices great more affordable than saree shops in california united states where i live they look fabulous on any lady regardless of your culture saree is truly for every elegant woman who wants a piece of india is rich cultural as well as any who genuinely appreciate india is ancient history i was invited by a generous shop owner during the months of deepawali to check out their fabulous collection and my oh my i was astonished and feeling humbled that such amazing artistry existed beyond my wildest dreams haha having studied indian cultural history i had always admired the jewelry and clothing pieces from the indian part of the continent they are such fine artisans and creative people next i toured among the hawker centers that offer rich indian fare and decliously tender and mesmerizing naan bread prepared punjabi style northern indian oh gawd the buttery taste of the lovely bread gently peppered with spices and little seeds when dipped into home made curry was fabulous i only hoped that the young chef would wipe his hands first before handling money and food at the safe time i saw that and would like this young chap to kindly improve in this area please do yourself and customers a favour there was a very kind older tamil gentleman who asked me to try their spicy halal lamb with rice my goodness it was fabulously delicious and a very pleasant surprise everybody makes their biryani rice differently including the persians the afghanis but this muslim chef makes it so very blended with just the right shade of tasty spicy a big thank you arabic shukraan to the hardworking chefs who made this trip to singapore a meal to remember there was plenty of hand made items on sale this months september  to october i was having a great time taking photos chatting with friendly locals and because of my accent was mistaken as australian by some australians actually mine was a blended scottish accent since i speak hebrew arabic japanese some german lots of aussies shopping here and i chatted with them and their kids too so cute overall it was an art galore with lots to see and lots of memories to make since everywhere you go in little indian amazing works of art and jewelries pops into the eye there was a small vegetarian restaurant that sell fabulous indians style candies which i loved and bought several pieces to try and great heavens they were even more delicious than they looked not too sweet like american confectionary which can kill you and cause diabetes so prevalent in california what a shame one must not forget the museum right in the heart of little india where tourists pay  to venture into foreign tourists such as myself although i had grown up in sinagpore when very little it was an amazingly rich experience after my tantalizing food tour one must see it for oneself to know and learn what india south east asian culture truly is i will be back in  definitely coming back i missed singapore and the great dishes i had while here\",\"lots of things to see i came on a saturday and it is was crowded some vendors will not let you take photos they will pressure you to buy they ask you things like what is your price range and will only show you certain things they can be rude if you decide not to buy they stares at you and will not give you room to shop would not be one of the things on my list to visit\",\"little india was on my friend is check list so we boarded the mrt to ne little india station walked around on street level to the next mrt farrer park station ne to exit the neighborhood it was a sunday afternoon so it seemed as if everyone was off work and hanging out on the streets i saw more men then women not sure why the smell of incense curry and bo in the heat was thick and difficult to bear no one picked on us none of us got robbed it seemed safe but just not comfortable we were not used to such crowded conditions we saw many people going in and coming out of mustafa centre so we went in to see what was inside it is a huge shopping center reminded me of walmart except larger much much larger i bought some local fruits guava mangosteen banana starfruit and longan one person in our group got lost in the buildings and panicked\",\"nice area a sizable section catering to the many indians who live in singapore a rather old area that have been preserved naturally lots of indian restaurants and stores\",\"well as the name implies this is a little bit of india located near the heart of singapore it it pretty easy to get to all you need to do is get off at the little india mrt station at bang you are there i simply wandering through the area just taking in the sights and sounds of all the stores and marvelling at the produce and textiles available especially the clothes that i have always admired the indians really know how to make a decent dress not like the ones you see in the chain stores in the shopping centres as for food there certainly is a lot of offerings around here though i was not able to find a place that sold a decent vindaloo namely because i was not looking hard enough or simply looking in the wrong places this place is certainly worth visiting while in singapore though you may need to spend a little more time here than i did\",\"east of singapore river lies an ethnic neighborhood that has indian tamil cultural elements and aspects influenced by other cultures how does one visit singapore and not stroll to little india hindu temples and colorful sari is with the aromatic stench of curry in all shape and form fills the air for hoards of street peddlers are ready to bargain ladies await for visitors ready to paint henna among the uniquely ethnic tamil of indian culture this is how i remember little india from my singapore visit in  this is little india in singapore\",\"very dirty place in singapore i was wondering how the government allows this place to be so dirty i loved seeing indian people in singapore there lots n lot of daily wage people i tried few restaurant and food carts the cost is cheaper compared to us dollars taste was ok\",\"if you are a ramen fan and would like to try an alternative version one that has a local twist then you will like this place the dish is a blend of singapore wanton noodle and japanese ramen it comes with slices of japanese style char siew onsen egg and a fried shrimp wrapped in potato while the price tag of s  appear to be high for a food center stall the quality is very good you can also opt to upgrade to the special with a whole egg additional shrimp and a bowl of mushroom with fish maw for s  that is what i did and i enjoyed it thoroughly\",\"this place is known for singaporean ramen very different from japanese stuff but with some similar elements like the soft cooked egg tempura shrimp charshu it comes with a bit of their own sauce and broth on the side ask for it spicy to get some chili sauce on the side the noodle was egg based thin had a good bite to it and you can see an old man making the noodles right in front it is definitely one of the more expensive stalls a small is  dollars  for medium  for large but they do add special attention to detail for example they use the tweezers from fancy restaurants to place the scallions in your bowl and wipe the bowl is edge before serving i had read the owner trained with chef andre before it is definitely unique and worth checking out\",\"singaporean ramen may not be for me but the dishes served up at a noodle story were so fantastically unique that it is worth your time star  how were the service and atmosphere i would heard horror stories about the lines at a noodle story so my friends and i arrived a full half hour or so before they opened on a rainy monday early evening to our surprise the place was empty and a noodle story went ahead and opened early i think because they felt bad for us from there everything was peachy and our three dishes came out quickly star star  how were the portions relative to the cost   for any hawker dish is boku expensive but given the size and complexity of this dish it was not in my mind unreasonable star stars  and  how was the food so i really really love the concept of ramen style noodle dishes with little to no broth and that is more or less exactly what this was with some great peripherals like shrimp wrapped in pan fried noodles and shrimp wontons having said that the entire dish especially the noodles were very fishy which for me is a pretty quick turn off even so good stuff and a dream for people who have different taste preferences from my own single star star  would you be excited to go back if i could taper off the fishiness this would be a dream dish so i would be excited to go back and see if i could get that option star\",\"so here is the thing i love all the toppings from the wontons to the egg to the crispy prawn and the ever soft tender char sui the prawn was my husband is favorite think tempura shrimp but next level the outer crunchy is spiraled and adds this insane texture the noddles themselves were just okay but i think it is just because i prefer super soft ramen but man best toppings ever on a ramen and the presentation is stunning a work of art\",\"michelin bib gourmand noodle stall in amoy street food center nicknamed singapore is ramen the noodle dish is a fun bowl of slightly springy noodle super good texture and rich soup on the side other accompaniments shrimp wonton egg pork slices fried shrimp ball are all tastey though not mindblowingwaited an hour for this was it worth it i guess so i could try it out but would not line up again\",\"a noodle story might be my favorite stall in singapore i heard the wait can be long but i got there at  pm and waited about  mins to order and  mins for the food the noodles egg wonton crispy prawn meat and presentation was prefect you can get it small or large but when i got there they were sold out of the large it was so good that i wish i have ordered two smalls the bf said this should been a michelin star stall fyi they were sold out before closing time cannot wait to come back to singapore and eat this\",\"i was really excited to try this but i think this may have been ranked the lowest out of all the hawker dishes i have tried on my trip it was  sgd pricey and it was alright i am pretty sure i asked for no chili but got chili anyway in my noodles so i ended up not being able to finish it at least the pork belly was nice and tender\",\"they call this a singaporean ramen i do not think that is an actual thing but the ramen is fairly unique and not like a traditional ramen at all the main different is the toppings the soup has wontons in it that are super delicious however the highlight is the single fried potato dumpling holy crap that dumpling is delicious it was so delicious like a super crunch deep fried curly fry\",\"aww yeah i was full already but that did not stop me from stuffing myself with noodles from this place we went here early because we knew there will be a line up but i made a rookie mistake of having juice from a nearby stand after only finishing breakfast about half an hour before late breakfast p but geeze was it worthed going there and feeling like i could explode from eating too much this morning we only realized that the noodles has prawns in it when i started to order and then we found out the broth is seafood based as well luckily can they were nice enough to whip up a simple broth for me even though i am sure it is not as good as the normal broth it was still awesome and the char siu it melts in the mouth every mouth full was loaded with flavor definitely worth the visit\",\"termed the singapore ramen this take on our traditional wanton noodles is a winner in every aspect high quality ingredients prepared well yet at a relatively much lower price point starts from  when compared to similarly quality ramens where else can you find such a rare gem it is no wonder the lines are out the door every single day al dente noodles melt in your mouth pork perfectly marinated ramen style eggs hard whites runny yolks crispy wantons full flavoured umami packed soup only available if you dine at the hawker just take my yes you can definitely find ordinary wanton noodles at more than half that price but you get what you pay for some people complain about the lines and the high price for a hawker dish but if you really consider the premium ingredients and time effort taken to prepare every bowl is  really too much the same argument goes for most other hawker dishes actually why are people willing to pay more for cafe food which often takes way less effort to prepare at perhaps x the price with minimal complaints be prepared to wait at least  mins during lunch time thinking of going later to avoid the queue you may be disappointed sometimes they close early as they run out of ingredients learnt that the hard way so go early when they open before lunch or before dinner to avoid disappointment they have an express queue which comes at a premium of  per bowl well worth it if you are crunched for time but absolutely must try this pro tip if you are in the cbd area noodle story is sometimes delivered on grabfood under their hawker initiative\",\"the queue was long the price was high for a hawker vendor but the food lived up to expectation this is not a ramen shop by any japanese means for ramen broth is half the meal here it is a dry bowl filled with pan fried yumminess be sure to add this place to your singapore experience\",\"despite this hawker stall is a bit out of the way and not as popular a noodle story is definitely worth a visit i came in the early dining hours and there was already a line up and i unfortunately had to wait behind a person that ordered  noodles to go nevertheless the noodle here was nothing like i have had before there are so much ingredients in one order and everything tastes amazing\",\"this was delicious i got a small and it was a perfect amount for one the distinct textures between the dumplings soft boiled eggs noodles and fried prawns were so playful and tasty absolutely recommend\",\"i will never look at ramen the same again singaporean style ramen is how they describe this spot it is located on the bottom floor of the amoy hawker stand i came right when they opened because i knew there would be a long line around lunch time this place is packed with business people on their lunch break they have three sizes and i went with the medium get the chili once you get your bowl mix it all up their cha su is probably the best i have ever had their hk style wontons were beyond amazing their crispy wrapped prawn was nice and crunchy and their egg cooked to perfection i have never anything so good and it is a must stop if you are in singapore\",\"it is worth the wait waits in hawker centers are common for good food most of them seem to be worth it this one is definitely worth it get there before it becomes a bigger thing singapore style ramen has been created and this is it in my top  ramens of all time best of luck to a noodle story actually they really do not need it they are already there\",\"this singaporean take on ramen is special each ingredient the egg beef wonton etc is delicately and carefully prepared and assembled into one delicious bowl queue nowhere near as bad as people here have suggested  minutes at  on a thursday for a by hawker standards pricey  bowl of ramen\",\"price is a little on the higher side but that is only because they use quality ingredients really worth the queue\",\"the noodles definitely achieve the shop is goal of serving gourmet noodles at hawker prices the flavors in the dish are extremely fresh and the broth is very well seasoned  stars just because the service while trying to operate most efficiently in a small space can be a bit awkward as you are prompted to state your order while still halfway down the line at a point when you cannot actually read the menu so it is tough to decide any additions modifications you may want to make to the order other than the size of the portion although the wait is not nearly as bad as other reviews make it out to be once i had located the stall i maybe waited  mins in total between joining the line and receiving my food at  pm peak lunch hour\",\"singaporean style ramen yes please came to the amoy street food centre with a mission to eat at noodle story it is on the first floor and has a really nice sign and exterior and a long line of people waiting for food which is a good sign i waited like   minutes to order there is just one thing the noodles but you can get small medium or large and you can add on extra sides like an extra egg or more hk style wontons the lady behind me said that the larger sizes just come with more noodles after i placed my order for a small bowl the light for the sign went out the lady behind me said that that meant they ran out of stuff i had such good timing the noodles were so delicious no broth noodles were amazing the hard boiled egg was cooked perfectly the potato wrapped shrimp was super tasty and the wontons and chashu pork were yummy a perfect  my noodles also came with a soup totally worth the wait\",\"minute wait we got into the line at   and got our food at  minutes past one if you have that kind of time this place worth the visit we got two small bowls of singaporean style ramen and we both enjoyed it a lot the noodles the broth all the dressings were phenomenal the slow cooked egg was silky and creamy chirashi pork was delish my boyfriend wants to come back here again after the rush hour as you can see the line getting significantly shorter after  pm and they are open till  also since it was hard for me to find the food center i bookmarked gayatri restaurant the place right outside of it so it is easy to find it next time the hawker center is two stories and the noodles are in the ground level  sgd per small bowl of ramen i think it is worth it\",\"the only reason to stop by here is to have a sip of history long bar invented the singapore sling a gin based fruity cocktail that was historically used to make drinking alcoholic beverages by women more acceptable the bar is located in the raffles hotel in a colonial style building follow the signs to go around the left of the main entrance of the hotel and then go up the stairs to find the long bar service is fine not especially attentive no one came to check on us after we would finished our first round of drinks oh and did i mention that it is ridiculously overpriced you will be paying sgd  for a cocktail sure it is the original and it is fairly strong even if served in a small glass and i guess you have the cool vibe of being able to eat the complimentary peanuts and throwing the shells on the floor like they did in the old days but still that is a steep price to pay i would go out here for one drink as a tourist and no more\",\"what can i say i drank the sling i ate the peanuts i came back for more the next day we had a lovely chat with the estonian manager as well as a travel writer who sat next to us for our pre happy hour happy hour it is one of those easy bucket list moments that delivers arrive between  pm for fewer crowds at  the line was crazy\",\"recently renovated and reopened in late  it is on the second floor of the raffles hotel and you may need to try a few different stairways and elevators before you find the right one to the bar which makes it a bit of a hidden but historic gem and icon there was a small wait of a couple people when we arrived at pm on a wednesday but we were still seated within  minutes up the winding staircase to a less crowded upper level peanut shells were piled on the floor next to each table as most guests indulged slowly in their high potency and high priced cocktails we ordered a singapore sling sgd and a mocktail version which was basically fruit punch for sgd they did a great job making it feel like a throwback to another time and place drawing on malay plantation themes with mechanical fans wafting across the ceiling but thankfully with modern air conditioning it is a place to indulge in the experience not just the drinks including getting lost in hotel courtyards and considering whether you might have a few more and book a  night room i can think of many worse ways to spend  for two on an afternoon\",\"gimmicky although fun the staff are professional and courteous a little slow although good enough for a quick drink during the afternoon heat singapore sling was delicious and after a couple you can feel the effect nicely\",\"having a singapore sling at raffles is on most people is must do lists when they come to singapore i must admit the first time we came several years ago i was less than impressed with the actual drink and the service but we decided to give it another shot again this trip boy i am glad we did the original sling was delicious and we loved the device that they got from sipsmith to shake them in i do not remember seeing or hearing this on our first trip but it was a cool gimmick the bartender was also very nice  stars instead of  because they price is still insane however i would do the same thing if i were them\",\"this place is overrated yes its a complete tourist trap and if you really love the singapore sling you should come here at least once but the thing is that back in california i never had a singapore sling nor did i really yearn for one we did not have too long in singapore so we wanted to check out all the touristy things first of all  original singapore sling will cost you  usd this is before tax and service charges we got one and we also got the raffles  gin sling for  usd before service charges and tax the prices do not really bother me since it is at a very nice hotel what irked me was the fact they forgot my drink had to wait like  mins since it was so busy service sucked and there was long line to get in if you have a peanut allergy do not come here another thing i found weird is that if this is such a classy place there are peanut shells all over the ground making it look messy on the plus side its all you can eat peanuts for free\",\"craving for an authentic top notch singapore sling in the singapore hot weather took us to the long bar this place made our short trip to singapore complete and also made it a success before visiting the long bar my husband and i did a small self singapore sling cocktail hunting tour and i would say this place out beat everywhere else we have tried giving the fact that this place served the most original ss we were still amazed by how flavorful the cocktail was knowing the fact thay the drink does not contain any egg white but the way it was shake and prepared pushed out its complex flavors and textures looove it\",\"we must have arrived before the long lines formed we waited but a few minutes i am glad i had good company because that was really all i enjoyed here the singapore sling is an overrated sweet drink the peanuts on the floor gross skip it it is not worth it\",\"the singapore sling here has been rummored to to be terrible and it is not good also tried the planter is punch it was pretty bad to worse than the singapore sling everyone in my group agreed as well drinks are very expensive too  to  singapore currancy you can eat a nice meal for that price\",\"when in singapore we wanted to accomplish two things with our visit to long bar  we wanted to see raffles hotel  we had to try the original singapore sling the hotel was named after british statesman sir thomas stamford raffles the founder of singapore the hotel has just had major renovations and the grounds are absolutely stunning the long bar also does not disappoint there was a small queue to be seated at noon on a monday we were seated with a bag of peanuts and two menus the waiter came took our order for singapore slings promptly the original singapore sling will cost you  usd this is before tax and service charges however this is the original and well worth it the recipe seems to be a mystery i think each place in singapore where i ordered a singapore sling tasted differently it is now great to have the original and have a baseline i thought it was great not too sweet and a perfect mid afternoon cocktail if you want to eat anything with this you wo not be able to as they only have a cocktail menu overall you should come here at least once if you are in singapore pro tip if you have a peanut allergy do not come here there is a bag of peanuts on every table and shells all over the floors\",\"i am all for visiting historic places while on vacation but this place just screams tourist trap to me yes it is the birthplace of the singapore sling and yeah the whole country charges a little more for alcohol than you may be used to but this is not some fancy mixology bar so it is really hard to justify spending the  usd for one singapore sling i mean my wife and i did it and the drink was tasty and i even got a tiny buzz from it but almost every bar in this city also serves a singapore sling for much cheaper all the free peanuts in the building wo not recoup that cost service was basic one person sat us down another took our order then took our menus away if you really want to check out this bar just come in do a short lap around and head out the venue is nice to look at but super overrated overall\",\"i expected there to be a crowd of tourists here i expected that everyone would be ordering singapore slings and i expected them to command a premium price like every alcoholic drink in singapore there was not a line i ordered a gin and tonic service was great the atmosphere here which i should note was during reconstruction of the rest of the hotel was really nice classic and upscale and there was not a line when i visited the bartender and servers are great i did not try the peanuts but you should note that you can throw the shells on the floor that makes this the only place where you can legally litter on the floor fun times\",\"a trip to singapore would not be complete without a trip to the long bar at raffles hotel this was my first time here and while i was sticker shocked at the price of a traditional singapore sling it was totally worth it seriously amazing and refreshing the atmosphere was awesome and relaxing they do not allow a ton of people to enter at once so you do not have the deal with the over crowded typical bar scene it was a great time\",\"meh to be fair the hotel is under renovation so this is a little pop up instead of the real deal but to wait in a long line to have a sickly sweet cocktail for  nah lots of better things to do in singapore maybe when the hotel reopens but i would suggest the gin and tonic instead\",\"we were disappointed to see that the hotel and bar were closed for renovations i really wanted my bf to experience having a singapore sling at this iconic hotel that being said they have a pop up long bar set up for us die hard fans who will stop at nothing to get our taste of the singapore sling when you walk in you first get a reminder that durians are not welcome in the bar you can order your singapore sling as well as a few other drinks at the bar and if you are lucky enough to come at the right time you can sit at the bar along the front window or at one of three small high tops it was as good as i remembered it served with a quarter slice of pineapple and a cherry peanuts are still a staple and yes you can still throw your shells on the ground such a cheeky experience worth doing once as a stop in your singapore journey\",\"this famous old world icon nestled i side raffles hotel was a true delight home of the original singapore sling it has fans on the ceiling beautiful wood throughout and marble floors the peanut shells on the floor add an insouciance that enhances the ambiance yes it is expensive but i would not have missed it for the world\",\"unique high priced drinks but what the hell its where the sling originated enjoy i must say what bar can you bring your kids and you can bring your kids and throw the peanut shells on the floor\",\"you cannot make a journey to singapore and not experience the singapore sling cocktail at the place where it was created so needless to say it is the tourist thing to do and while it is not the most amazing bar experience you will have it is certainly not just a touristy thing to do set in the historic raffles hotel the bar takes you to a bygone era one where plantations doted the countryside and where world empires colonized the remote spots on the earth it also does not hurt that they encourage you to throw the peanut shells on the floor but remember only the peanut shells now there is a menu of cocktails but you really should come here for one thing the original singapore sling there are other versions on the menu of course but you really should have the original at about sgd it is a bit pricey and you are probably not going to want to order a second or maybe you do the bar menu selection is what you probably would come to expect and it is a nice nosh to go with your cocktail especially if you want to walk out versus stumbling out service was pretty good and the staff attentive while they were not hovering over you and quick they certainly made you feel comfortable so when it comes to visiting singapore you better make a stop at the raffles and grab a sling at the place where it was made\",\"totally worth it the experience of going to the raffles hotel and having a singapore sling at the long bar make it all worth the price it is one of those touristy things everyone should do\",\"the hefty prices and sugary drinks are customary to raffles i will cut to the chase the drinks are very expensive not great either and there are peanut shells all over the floor there are current repairs but to be finished in august  not a fan raffles not a fan\",\"yes it is a tourist trap by definition and it resembles the london eye a bit too much but if it is a reasonably clear day it is still a worthwhile way to soak in singapore is ever changing and ever growing skyline whether or not you are a tourist and if you are it is a great way to orient yourself and get a feel for how the city is laid out like the london eye each capsule is suspended on the outside of the wheel to minimize obstructed views and like the london eye the number of folks who can get into any capsule at any time is limited so that you can get a somewhat personalized and uncrowded experience better yet each capsule is far larger than what i remember from my multiple trips aboard the london eye so there is plenty of room to spread out in this instagram social media and selfie fueled age it is all the more worthwhile if you are hungry for a few good shots and a few more likes so again if it is clear out and you have not been aboard it is worth the splurge\",\"does give you a decent view of the city it is a short ride and path but it is an interesting vantage point it is something to do if you are by the gardens by the bay i think it would be more fantastic if it spanned over the city for longer and more fruitful view of the city it was cool to see the marina bay sands building up a bit closer and to see the soccer field right on the water at least\",\"this is just a review to say how amazing this looks it is great to see it in person wow it is just so big i cannot tell you anything about riding it however because the government had it shut down due to coronavirus scare while i was there so my rating is not to say it is bad or good because i only got to see it from a distance so to speak i will tell you i was sad to find it closed when i got there but like my husband said if you have been on one ferris wheel you have been on them all he is not wrong i suppose i was looking forward to seeing the view from the top i will be back to try it after all of the craziness settles down side note it lights up in the evening and looks phenominal\",\"purchased a voucher from klook very easy redeem just show your voucher from your phone i purchased a voucher that gets you the singapore flyer ride with the buffet from bhandari is saffron restaurant no queue at the time for my group of  stop by the restaurant first to get your singapore flyer tickets youd be asked if you want to have the buffett before or after the ride and we chose the latter the experience was exhilarating this is part of my must try list for my fellow tourists great view of the city from the very sturdy and air conditioned capsule this is something you should not miss\",\"i had such high hopes for the singapore flyer i love ferris wheels if a city has a huge ferris wheel it is probably on my list to do i think i had high expectations since it does give you a birds eye view of singapore however after seeing the view at a neighboring building it just pales in comparison also the capsule glass in which i rode in was dirty i think if i rode the singapore flyer first to see the singapore skyline before going to another location to view the skyline i may have a different opinion on this what is cool about the singapore flyer is that they offer a dinner ride and a ride with champagne or a singapore sling if you ride the singapore flyer after observing the view from another location i would suggest the ride with the drinks\",\"singapore flyer will show you a  view of the city and all the sites it has to offer on one side you will see the bay esplanade the bridge and on the other you will see the skyline marina bay sands gardens by the bay etc there is a voice track for you to follow what you are seeing as you make your way around on the ferris wheel there was no line to get in a pod i would imagine if there was it would go pretty fast considering the number of pods there are and how much space there is in there be prepared to share a pod with others for a good  minutes this attraction is family friendly and good for all ages the elderly children adults and young adults as well it is a unique view of the city but i would bet that there are better spots to see the marina bay sand skyline gardens etc for a better price but if you are limited on time and want to see an aerial view of the city the flyer is the way to go\",\"honestly been to a bunch of these around the world and the one thing that sets this apart is the food underneath it also the fact that they built the entire food court and small fish pond right underneath which to my experience i have never seen before so the engineering aspect is crazy cool besides the gardens view and the bay same experience spend time with friends and family is what it is all about\",\"my son loved the singapore flyer we went as part of the changi recommends tour it had been raining on and off but was only sprinkling on and off during our tour we were fortunate as this meant that we could ride the flyer the tour guide got our tickets while we relaxed after our walk there because of the rain there were not as many people waiting to ride there was a wedding party and it was cute to see the couple so happy we were fortunate that they allowed our tour party of  a car to ourselves looking out we could see many of the attractions of singapore and out towards the ocean when we got to the top we could look all around us as the view was not obstructed by any buildings would ride again as it was fun and a smooth ride might not be as fun if it was crowded but great first experience on the flyer\",\"i had a different kind of experience on the flyer i had dinner in one of the capsules this was a very neat dinner with spectacular views the dinner was great and it was interesting how the staff changed courses they are very fast when bringing food into the capsule it was a nice ambiance and there were only four tables  people total this is the perfect date setting\",\"it was very cool to be able to go high in the skyline to see the magnificent sights of singapore you get an amazing view of this modern city and the harbour that makes business boom around here the tour lasts about  minutes and gives you views of everything along with some great information of the city and tours that are offered the biggest downside to this tour is the price it is pretty expensive we paid spd for  adults and  child to tour it i know this is an expensive city and it costs lots of money to vacation here so just be expecting a large bill to take the ride on a clear day the views are spectacular\",\"i happened to befriend a few americans at one of the speakeasies here in town one recommended the singapore flyer at first i was not keen on doing it because it is super touristy i have been here to singapore multiple times and this attraction was never was on my radar but you know what it was really nice i like that anyone can ride this young or old there are no height or age limitations it goes so slow that you do not even feel it moving yet you get a gorgeous view of the city even if you are afraid of heights do not be it is a great attraction i did not realize how nice the singapore skyline is it can actually rival a few cities singapore you continue to be a favorite and this was wayyyy before crazy rich asians\",\"so i did the touristy thing and did the singapore flyer but i upgraded and did the vip package which came with your choice of champagne or a singapore sling the good news is that there is no line when you do the package but the bad news is that you have to wait for your designated time slot since the vip pod only occurs on certain times you also get to hang out in the lounge air conditioned of course and order drinks too if you are waiting to board nice views and it was a good  minute or so ride\",\"i loved the singapore flyer there was a small line but it moved very quickly we shared our pod with about eight other people which i did not mind because we were able to take pictures for each other the ride is very smooth and slow we went at night and had a beautiful view of singapore all lit up i know you can get good views on the buildings but i am glad we did the flyer we really enjoyed it\",\"the view alone at night is worth it the staff really take care of you the dinner was ok but the view made up for it the soup was a little salty and the desert could have been better but the main was great i would highly recommend the dinner experience\",\"rated highly on tripadvisor i had higher hopes for this and came away with a bit of disappointment you can get similar views within other high rises in singapore but after paying for this i opted not to\",\"i was surprised at how little people go here there was no line for tickets no line to get into the capsule and we had the whole capsule for ourselves considering it is the tallest ferris wheel ever the capsule is big and can probably hold a decent amount of people however perhaps so little people go here is because there really is not much of a nice view to be seen during the day one side looks off into the bay and the other the city skyline it is also expensive even though i found a coupon in one of the tourist maps\",\"in singapore it is all about the views the singapore flyer stands m high and is asia is largest giant observation wheel it takes  minutes for a full rotation and each capsule has a  person capacity the ride is incredibly smooth you do not feel a thing the views are good but after being at the top of multiple buildings in singapore with breath taking views this experience for  singaporean dollars was ok\",\"if you want a nice and stable aerial view of the city of singapore make a short trek to the flyer it is a bit pricey for the tourist attraction but it is worth the trip especially when the day is nice and clear getting to the flyer is fairly easy just follow the pedestrian signs when getting off the mrt and it is roughly a   min walk to the flyer for the flyer itself it resembles a huge ferris wheel with little futuristic pods that you could stand sit inside if you are a high roller or want to treat someone on a special date there are different pods where you can ride the flyer in style and have a fancy lunch or dinner inside for the regular pods it can hold up to at least  people once inside the pod it is around a min ride the ride itself is fairly pleasant stable and smooth if you have motion sickness or anything fear not a friend of mine has severe motion sickness but she was fine throughout the flyer experience without having to take any medications for it most of the time you forget that the wheel is moving due to the pretty sights i highly suggest having enough battery juice for your phone for pictures and such you can travel around your pod and take pictures at multiple angles as you desire and if you are tired of standing there is a nice bench that you can sit and relax overall this was a pretty interesting experience and i would recommend it to any first time visitors to singapore if you want more of an interactive experience that includes an aerial view i would suggest checking out the cable car vs the flyer since there is more to see do\",\"wow the singapore flyer offers an incredible unobstructed view of singapore it is definitely worth every penny you cannot find a view like this anywhere else enclosed in the clear capsule you can look around and see pretty much all the major sights of singapore marina bay sands gardens by the bay the supertrees the dna helix bridge and much more give this a try next time you are in singapore you wo not regret it side note you can also have dinner in the flyer so that is a cool experience worth looking in to if you are considering this attraction\",\"visiting the singapore flyer is an absolute must do while in singapore i personally recommend going right at sunset the lines are gone and chances are you will have the entire capsule to yourself going at sunset gave such a gorgeous view of the city as we crested the top of the wheel the sun went down and the city lit up i have nothing but positive things to say about visiting the singapore flyer the staff is very friendly walking to the flier through the line is also interesting they have turned the queue area into a museum almost there are fun facts about the singapore flyer to be found in addition to some interactive activities\",\"my hostess andrea was very professional and provided superior customer service although the wait was a little long she always checked in with us to make sure our needs were met we will definitely come back and appreciate her pleasant attitude and professional demeanor keep up the excellent standards\",\"my favorite bistro oyster bar in singapore excellent service and delicious food not as pricey as lavo located inside marina bay sands resort i had brunch here on saturday and also was honored to meet chef jonathan despite his busy schedule during service all of the staff were so attentive and friendly it made us feel like we were getting a red carpet treatment even though it was just a regular day for the workers there we had an oyster platter db original burger squid ink pasta brussel sprouts mushrooms also some champagne and mixed drinks that were not on the menu they have an excellent wine list and dessert menu i also had some freshly made madeleines molten chocolate cake and baked alaskan for dessert i made an early reservation for brunch at am it was not that crowded but after my oysters came it started to get busy we had rain serving us ace was the bartender balthazar was the gm as well as olivia and everyone else working i will have to say that this place has unsurpassed service and excellent food shall definitely be back it is one of the busier and best places to eat in marina bay sands\",\"this place is conveniently located inside a huge shopping mall it has a three consecutive brunch selection that is modestly priced the food and customer service here was excellent i definitely recommend it\",\"service is good we arrived aft pm for supper staff were good to let us sit in as they close around pm i think like the shrimp cocktail escargots broccoli brussel sprouts were a little hard to chew overall the food service are good\",\"love love love it first of all the service fantastic every friggin person at db bistro was on point the bartender the hostess the server bringing my food the manager all of them were friendly chatty pro active and helpful take note all other restaurants this is how it should be i have noticed that often restaurants serve subpar dishes during restaurant week not db bistro the dishes were also listed on their regular menu and were just great i have said it before and i will say it again simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication i love innovation but a classic is often a classic for a reason and when it is executed well it is hard to beat i started with the kale caesar salad i will definitely be back for this it was one of the best salads i had in singapore the dressing was in perfect ratio to the salad and the anchovies gave it that typical caesar flavor the slow cooked salmon showed great skill in my opinion it was cooked just right the dessert was another hit the molten chocolate cake with the salted caramel sauce was pure indulgence and this is not where the praise stops the cocktail recommended by the bartender was simply amazing i guess the only negative thing i can say about db bistro is that i ate way too much and that this experience spoiled many other restaurants for me as it will be hard to find somewhere in singapore which matches the service and food of db bistro in short awesome food awesome service they will see me back at db bistro\",\"after a show at the theatre we decided dinner was in order first time at the bistro the burgers are really good juicy and flavorful will definitely come back\",\"really wanted to like this place better the boulud name raised my expectations so it could only disappoint from there which it unfortunately did whilst service was prompt and ninja like and ambience was very nice the all important food was a major let down especially considering we ordered the signature dish we had a db burger and salmon tartare to share as we had only eaten brunch mins before the db burger was ordered medium but came out very pink the foie gras inside was barely noticeable and made zero impact or difference to the burger whilst the texture of the burger was good it was woefully under seasoned and thus lacked any flavour more salt would have probably helped bring out the flavour of the quality beef a few miserable slivers of onion for  a burger could not they have at least caramelised them and lettuce were scattered inside along with a smear of mustard and ketchup the parmesan bun was also totally underwhelming  is massively overpriced for a burger that would have been beaten in a blind taste test by shake shack or omakase on the plus side the chips french fries were excellent salmon tartare was very small and not at all worth the  portion essentially what you would get if it was served in a martini glass again under seasoned and lacking any real character even the bread basket they served us was disappointing with bread that had the texture of being cut and out in the air for a few hours overall for what was essentially a meal for one we paid  and did not even order a drink do not be sucked in by the celebrity name the food is far from what the price tag leads you to expect\",\"i am a big fan of daniel boulud is restaurants i have been to almost all of his nyc restaurants and i have been to the bar boulud in london as well so i was excited to see a db bistro moderne in singapore i came here on a busy saturday night and sat at the bar the staff was friendly and welcoming and i quickly had a cocktail and some bread in front of me i ordered the steak frites usually steak frites is a mid grade hanger or skirt steak at db it is usda prime imported from the usa so it is the top quality beef you can get the dish was served with frites and a mini wedge salad the steak was a bit undercooked but they quickly took it back and brought it up to where i wanted it temperature wise after all was corrected with the steak i went on to enjoy the entire plate of food although a bit on the pricey side it was an excellent dining experience\",\"over the past couple of year i have been to db bistro  or  times and it is become one of my favorite places in sg even though it is in a mall the menu is french american with some classics lots of seafood and burgers perhaps one of their most famous dish is the original db burger which is made from short ribs and foie gras it sounds totally decadent and at  it is the most expensive burger i have had in my life but the short rib foie gras combo was not working for me even though i love both separately a better choice is the yankee burger which is exactly what a great burger should be like the other famous item is their seafood tower available in  sizes we had the medium one which was basically good enough as a dinner for  people loved the lobster and oysters and speaking of which the oysters here are the best that i have had in singapore very fresh full of briny juice and a nice selection of both european and north american oysters the surprise hit for me was their steak i had the ny strip and it was a better steak than most of the steak houses in singapore ok at  it is not that cheap but it was perfectly cooked and very flavorful and tender would definitely order a steak again overall it is a great place for some oysters and drinks as well as a full dinner seafood or steaks or burgers\",\"on sunday we had a quick pre theater lunch at db bistro moderne it is an elegant and comfortable dining room not liking the looks of the appetizer choices and not wanting dessert we passed over the set brunch items and focused on the ala carte side of the menu for a starter we shared the large portion of tuna tartar  served with cucumber mint yogurt and thin homemade chickpea crackers the dish suffered from a spiciness and strong dressing that sadly overpowered the tuna i have had this same sort of dish elsewhere and most places let the fresh tuna flavor take center stage luke is does an especially nice version using avocado the chickpea crackers were not doing the trick so we asked for more of the complimentary sliced baguette bread to use in its place for mains we chose burgers i had the yankee burger with cheddar cheese and my friend chose the frenchie burger the presentation of the tall burger and the condiments is really nice see photo the sirloin lacked enough seasoning to enhance the natural flavors of the high quality beef my friend had the same complaint although i requested medium well my burger was served at medium still very pink in side i am always a little underwhelmed with the burgers here on my last visit i had the original db burger and remember having the same issues with it the good the dining room is elegant and comfortable the staff is friendly the bad tuna tartar needs less seasoning burgers need more seasoning the verdict i am looking forward to returning again and exploring more of the menu   stars\",\"first let me say that this is a reluctant four i would rather it be a three but the service and food were both of good quality party of two saturday night made the day prior the decor is understated elegance comfortable attractive the tables are nicely spaced and the booths looked comfortable unfortunately we were seated at a table that was directly in line with the traffic from the kitchen to the dishing room so it was bit uncomfortable we has the steak tartare frenchie burger original db burger fries and for dessert durian souffl and maccarons the food quality was good as expected for the price it was not as exceptional as expected the tartare was good but i have had better the fries we under seasoned the burgers were delicious and the portion was small we shared everything and originally started with the frenchie thinking it would be filling the portion was small so we ordered the db burger the patty was larger after all it is stuffed with short ribs and foie gras two things pushed this from a three to a four service server mira was outstanding and attentive kudos to the restaurant for having quality servers and kudos to mira for caring dessert the durian souffl was over the top delicious durian is such an odd fruit and forbidden in many places for the smell so i was surprised to see it on the menu mira and i had a brief conversation about how they actually use real durian and the controversy around that th maccarons were also very good and surprisingly affordable  small for s  the best of course were the madelines served after the meal these were heaven light fluffy lemony warm dusted with powdered sugar all in all a good experience but with so many choices for dining in singapore i doubt that i will return to this particular venue\",\"if you have never heard of daniel boulad you need to get your head out of your ass seriously he is amazing and db bistro certainly lives up to having his name on the place when i first moved to singapore i wanted to take myself out to a nice place after my i closed my first deal at work and knew there were some celebrity restaurants in the mbs being that i was flying solo for this dinner i knew i wanted somewhere that i would feel comfortable sitting at the bar alone and somewhere that had killer cocktails and amazing food db had it all i was immediately sat at the bar the bartender i wish i could remember his name was chatty but not annoying and made his recommendations and the service was excellent i had the lychee martini some killer oysters the salmon and the molten chocolate cake everything was excellent since then i have been back about  times i take clients there i took my friends who were visiting from the us and have gone back on my own each time the bartender remembers me and my name and always makes a point to say hello which i think is a nice touch i have had everything from their lobster to the steak to the pasta and everything is good if you are looking for a special occasion place date night client dinner or lunch or place to sit at the bar and enjoy some me time db bistro is the place to be p s do not skimp on the bread it is delicious\",\"now i came here really wanting to love this place and i loved some of the food but it did definitely fall short of expectations first let me say that the service here is excellent definitely the best i experienced in singapore and i sat at the bar i ordered a burger and french onion soup to start the french onion soup was very good though quite pricey but definitely the best french onion soup i ever had unfortunately though that was not what i really wanted i came here for the burger and the reason db bistro moderne is only getting three stars instead of four or five the burger had quite a burnt tast and i ordered medium the beef did not seem to be of a high quality which is disappointing as i am sure they spent a pretty penny on it the bun was soaked and surprisingly depressing if only they knew how to keep the bun dry i ordered the yankee burger and really do not have anything positive to say about it i would take a carl is jr six dollar burger over this any day of the week and it is a third of the price i really want to try this place again since the french onion soup was so good and the bartender hooked me up with free madeleine is which were fresh and very buttery next time i am in singapore i will be back here and hopefully i get more of the french onion soup awesome madeleines and great service and less of the horribly overrated disgusting burger\",\"this is a review of a dinner date at db bistro moderne in the shoppes at marina bay sands the ambiance is modern with touches of the classic i do like the kitchen behind the frosted glass it is a nice comfortable room i think its great that the tables are not so very close together tinyurl com cssjthe service was extremely good they were attentive throughout the meal the staff was friendly polite and professional the food ranged from good to exceptional complimentary bread for me this was the weakest part of the meal there were three kinds of bread but i did not find any of them particularly interesting tinyurl com clhsdsteak tartare cornichons capers parsley baby romaine grilled country bread this was my date is selection for a appetizer i tried it and thought it was very good it was tender and oh so flavourful truth be told while i eat it relatively often steak tartare is not my favourite dish but this was very good as with most of the dishes the presentation was quite nice tinyurl com bppfewdsan daniel prosciutto arugula toasted country bread i selected this dish as my starter this was truly excellent prosciutto this is living proof that great food starts with great ingredients so simple yet so wonderful tinyurl com cxpptrhthe frenchie burger beef patty topped with confit pork belly caramelized onion morbier cheese arugula cornichons served on a black pepper bun i selected db moderne so that i could try their burger i could not order their signature burger i no longer eat foie gras i selected the frenchie burger this was the best burger i have eaten in singapore it surpassed the burger at omakase but this really gets into the debate between diner style burgers and gourmet burgers i think the frenchie was smaller than i expected but the ingredients were amazing and came together so well it was cooked to a perfect medium rare this allowed the flavour of the beef to shine through the morbier cheese is what took it over the top it was such a great selection i loved it the fries were good but certainly not amazing tinyurl com bnemgtkduck confit savoy cabbage olive oil crushed potatoes mustard jus my date selected the duck confit this was not a surprise i tried it and it was quite good she really enjoyed in tinyurl com cyrvyodessert for dessert she ordered the profiteroles and i ordered the chocolate fondant i tried both they were both chocolate lovers dreams however i preferred my chocolate fondant it was just an explosion of chocolate tinyurl com cdzyrqtinyurl com cgvyznsinister americano this was her cocktail i tried it it reminded me of fireball whiskey this means i liked it but i am not sure how for me it would pair with food tinyurl com dxngbwreceipt dinner for   tinyurl com bnjftoverall db bistro moderne provided all of the elements of a great meal food ambiance and service the burger would rate with almost any in the world however i think if they are going to do it why not go all the way and make the burger of a more reasonable size for dinner the remainder of the food was also enjoyable it just made for a pleasant dining experience\",\"i ended up at db bistro oyster bar by sheer happenstance came out to marina bay sands for the sg food festival the event was packed seemed to capacity and soooo very hot i lasted all of  minutes outside before i called it quits and decided to enter the mbs mall of course the mall was packed too decided on french food for lunch got in the queue for db bistro and after a ten minute wait we were in looking over the menu i realized i was duh in a daniel boulud restaurant oh db score lovely dining room much more elegant and modern than a french bistro but not stuffy another positive although the restaurant was full i was able to hold a conversation with my table mate with no problem the staff was very efficient our server very helpful for such a busy day our food came out rather quickly that was a nice surprise i started off with a db signature bloody mary it is a meal the drink included a skewer of prawn ham pickled veggies and a the all important stalk of celery to go with the bloody mary i ordered french fries with three dipping sauces yum and a lovely chilled lobster salad taste was meh i should of stopped at the drink and fries because the salad was really boring the person i was dining with ordered the new england casserole and he really enjoyed every bite the casserole was loaded with mussels clams shrimp fennel sausage and corn and it came with two generous chunks of toasted garlic bread so a score there three and a half stars all in all just an okay experience i know i know it is a daniel boulud restaurant but i am pretty sure he was nowhere in sight this sunday afternoon other than a celebrity chef name and prices to match there is nothing to compel me to return to this restaurant at this price range there are many more restaurants i would rather visit upon my return to the mbs mall\",\"for the price this should have rocked the casbah db as they call it has a nice menu and serve a great duck another good place to get someone else to pay and buy some nice wines if you cannot leave mbs had the lamb and duck confit the duck was awesome with succulent crispy skin and fall off the bone meat served on a bed of garbanzo beans with bacon this was five star worthy the lamb was cooked medium and pretty good served with mint and a nice burre rouge wine is pricey but service is excellent\",\"four stars for the food everything was delicious the salad was a little too salty but when we mentioned it it was replaced without questions two stars for service and ambiance very slow service we sat at the bar the only people on one side for  min before we got a glass of wine checked in an hour early for a dinner reservation and was told there would be a table in  min it took almost an hour ordered a bottle of wine that the sommelier  min later told us they didnt have asked for  min to make a new decision he didnt come back although we tried to wave him down several times finally got a bottle and had a glass but most of it we had to pour ourselves in regards to the ambience if you like to pay  for a mean for two with a view to people walking in the shopping mall it may work for you not exactly what i had in mind for a valentines day dinner with my lady\",\"it is a great deal having this french dinner at sands the restaurant is owned by a three star michelin chef which i just found out it is a chic restaurant with a choice of french or nyc\",\"an incredible burger and service to match i emailed them about a reservation in the morning got a confimation within an hour who needs opentable flashy but without comfort someone let db down on this decore design all hard surface the noise was deafing had this been designed for a concert hall it might have worked the conversation of the loud chinese  something girl could be heard easily from the bar to the shopping center the pink floyd cocktail while pretty was all ice and foam and the tartie mine alsacian was a  large cheese craker but oh the db burger was  very well spent just perfect thanks db dessert the apple mille feuille was way over thunk the sorbet saved the plate from complete disaseter\",\"after lunch at pita pan i hopped over to db bistro where i had visited three times previously for their revamped menu this place has always been one of my favourite dessert spots in singapore and it still is if you are thinking that the desserts here are over priced or belong to the atas petite sized kinds that are gone in less than  big mouthfuls then you might be interested to pop by here to have a look out from the menu is the old apricot vanilla souffle the new angmoh pastry chef benjamin siwek has gone local to come up with this royale durian souffl  this is by far a souffl with the most character the fluffy mixture seems insubstantial as one digs a spoon in but the flavour fills up the mouth just like hd surround sound system echoing in every space the queen fruit mangosteen was turned into a sorbet to accompany the durian but i was too busy with the souffl the peculiar thing is that the chocolate dessert here did not make a show the milk chocolate mousse with peanut brittle and banana ice cream  did not have multiple textures even though it sounds crunchy the base sat a rather dry brownie like cake layer which did not help to score points another southeast asian inspired dessert was the jackfruit verrine  which caused everyone is face to cringe with an extremely sour lime sherbet but once you mixed it with the coconut tapioca and palm sugar it all went down sweetly this was another satisfying experience and i am looking forward to the new items for the next season and last but not least i am grateful for the complimentary treat of db is or aka da bomb madeleines which are still as light as those on my previous visit they might be rustic bakes but once you try these it will be difficult to find a better one\",\"my favorite meal and michelin experience while in singapore the chef here truly understands the importance of presentation with how his dishes are prepared the only thing i will say to stay away from are the cocktails they are god awful and are a disgrace to the rest of this meal the amuse bouches were all wonderful the placement on platforms were a beautiful display the beet meringue with eel started off with this fluffy meringue that melted in my mouth followed by the fishy trout that rises to the front of my palate the devonshire cheese ball is pure pleasure an intense cheesy sensation that feels like the legs of a lover interlocking with me the buckwheat aspect does not stand out as much but that is ok in this case the fish and chips tasted more like a lemon potato tart than actual fish i enjoyed it but was my least favorite out of the bunch the duck sausage roll was a marvel in engineering as it was in taste the spring was crafted with such stability and beauty that i did not feel like eating it right away if you play with it a bit you will find that it is actually quite springy and sturdy the duck itself felt like a tongue but tasted more like a pate delicious the potato soup was a peasant meal prepared for the gods on mt olympus the soup had a treasure trove of treats and surprises with every sip i love that you drink it rather than spoon it up the macadamia nuts were such a good idea the brioche they offer with it had a lovely taste smell of parmesan cheese that complimented the soup quite well the irish oyster was a delight although the other elements like tapioca do not stand out as much the fishy profile breams like sunshine the english garden was sensory overload like walking through a bazaar so much was laid out and offered a barrage of sweet earthy floral and herby goodness the playful factor of the playing takes the experience to a whole other level bringing the inner child out in me the kombu watering can was another level of genius in the presentation of the dish worth the price of admission with this one the eggs in egg is quite the treat you have literal chicken eggs as well as fish eggs all contained within a ceramic dino egg i felt like a bird flying through the valleys of prehistoric canyons curving through the winding path of mushrooms eggs and picked acidity the pickled onions not only offered some lovely sweetness in the backdrop but provided some much needed texture every so often the smoked rosemary was a lovely touch that crept in and out of my senses the poached snapper is a slightly conservative dish but it is done so well the green peas and finger limes were a lovely canvas for the snapper and prawns to rest upon the peas were top notch making me reconsider why i hate peas to begin with the lobster was a little more of a step up in composition from the snapper in terms of progressiveness but still hits the spot high quality lobster charred grilled courgette draped in a splendid tomato broth the pigeon was the crown jewel of the meal robust and full of flavor in every bite\",\"i hate to give this place  stars because it means so much to me my husband proposed to me in singapore and we decided to celebrate it afterwards at jaan considering that it is a well known michelin starred restaurant we booked out the private room for sgd   and i was expecting a legit private room with an amazing view considering that jaan is located on the th floor of the stamford but nope literally we had a tiny window that looked like dental floss compared to the rest of the room and the room was not even private all they did were put up room dividers to make it into a private room but we could hear everything through the room dividers what a freaking disappointment and waste of money in terms of food everything was so beautifully put together and delicious chef kirk westaway definitely demonstrated his creativity and flawless execution in each and every course of the night see attached menu photo for more detail of what we had that night service was great very timely professional and knowledgeable my husband definitely had a great time going through their extensive wine menu i would have given this place  stars if it stops here argh what made me give jaan  stars is the restroom situation so jaan shares the restroom with bar rouge right next door when i went to use it the sink was covered in puke i am guessing somebody got real drunk at the bar and the floor was disgusting if i am paying this much money to dine at a high class michelin starred restaurant like jaan i expect the restroom situation to live up to their standard disgusting i really hope jaan comes up with a solution because bar rouge is damaging their reputation\",\"not the best michelin experience i have had but i enjoyed the food i came here to celebrate a friend is proposal with  others overall the food was thoughtfully crafted aesthetically beautiful and possessed complexity in its flavors service was professional and efficient and the timing of the courses was impeccable my biggest qualm and the reason for the star deduction was this we booked a private room which requires that a minimum s  be spent i e for a group of  each person was required to spend an additional  usd to meet this requirement one of the biggest reasons why we picked jaan was because of the gorgeous views that diners get to experience while they eat we walk into the private room and what do we see a sliver i wish i was exaggerating but i am not a sliver of a window honestly it was pathetic i get that the extra cost comes from the privacy of having your own room but that does not mean that we should be robbed of a beautiful view either we ended up having to take a couple quick photos of the city views after our meal by walking out into the main dining area which means we probably enjoyed it for a total of  minutes very disappointing\",\"for the price and this being a michelin star restaurant i really expected more from it the service was attentive and really on the ball the view of the city from the th floor was also very nice the food though for what we paid i was expecting each and every item to knock my socks off the most underwhelming thing was the bread of all of the french restaurants i have been to located in cali nyc vegas and france they all have many different types and varieties of bread this place just had one type a wheat sour dough and did not taste good i think the best part of the meal was the dessert as all of the items did not go well together and flavors were a bit off do not think i will come back to this place even if it were free\",\"what a wonderful experience all of the staff were brilliant with our hostess providing a delightfully quirky approach that helped us relax and settle in to enjoy the theatre that is jaan we went for the  course option but with all the treats and delights this really becomes more like  even though it is degustation and the servings appear small over the course of the meal you finished sated and your taste buds have truly experience an extraordinary variety after enjoying the truly amazing culinary delights to have chef kirk drop by for a chat was a highlight thank you for making mum is th birthday lunch such a memorable moment\",\"totally lived up to the hype not cheap bill for three was a thousand dollars sans wine just a couple of cocktails the elements of the menu just kept coming we did the  course menu having learnt that the  course only added a few more cheese and desert elements the core of the menu is the same but with  dollars more per person the seven course ended up being an  course we got a chef special small bites to open then a series of extra desserts and a sizable birthday cake the egg in an egg was my least favorite the service was impeccable professional and polite very impressed the view was amazing ambiance  noise level   ten being the quietest taste  flavor  service  return factor  recommend\",\"was not at all memorable chef did his obligatory visit at each table including mine and was not at all phased that i told him that nothing in his menu really stood out not only did they forgot about me when i checked in at the front desk but my view of the city was severely obstructed by another couple i guess that is what you get for being a single diner and oh by the way i am pretty sure i had more drinks and a better menu selection than that couple so if you think of it as a price per person per table ratio i am pretty sure i had them beat and i could have had a better view with my average meal several other window side tables were empty up until i had my last few courses so i was baffled on how they manage the table system bitter much yep and thanks for asking me how my meal was throughout the experience insert sarcasm here and not just at the end by the chef\",\"a epic journey of  highly creative and flavoursome courses was enjoyed while perched on a window side table on the th floor jaan is elegant and delicious modern french fare that is part art and part science from the artisan breads to  minute poached egg perfect snapper and baked pigeon if it cannot be prepared well here where can it be the cuisine was top shelf the desserts were deliciously rich and ample and the view was the best way to appreciate the utter vibrancy that is packed into this island country of singapore low point house champagne starts from  a glass high point a lifetime memory of the finest and most picturesque dining experience\",\"wow how to describe this experience hard with words best start at the beginning i booked some weeks ago the occasion being my hubbies birthday in my first inquiry i also stated that i would love a window table which was not available any longer we would be kept on the waiting list also they offered a complimentary birthday cake and i was able to chose up to  words on it the entire booking process was very smooth once i chose a menu  menus available you have to choose one of them per table beforehand i gave our dietary requirements and the wording on the cake i had also asked about dress code men with long trousers jeans are ok and long sleeved shirts ladies elegant and my contact patricia was very professional and friendly when i arrived on the night prior to my husband i was welcomed by patricia so nice seeing my email contact in person she was lovely and led to a window table yay surprise was her reaction my husband arrived and we ordered champagne by the glass received the amuse bouche followed by choosing a white wine this being the only element of the night i was not too pleased with as it did not taste at all like the sommelier described but that is subjective and did not diminish the overall experience the pace at which the  course menu was then served suited us fine faster in the beginning and slower toward the end we were famished and devoured the bread offered so we were glad for food arriving smoothly the food a feast for the eyes every single time and quite a show as well dry ice helps with the items on each plate being arranged in the perfect order to be scooped up just as is for the most delectable combination of flavour and aromas i have seldom had such a combination of different cooking styles fermentation slow cooking raw food that went so well together personally i do not believe much in overly experimental or molecular cooking as i want to eat properly when i am hungry and enjoy great quality combined with creative excellency as is the case with chef kirk westaway is cooking oh and chef stepped out of the kitchen to present dessert himself spraying warm chocolate mousse to die for into a variation of chocolate bowl asking everyone how they liked their food needless to say my hubbies birthday cake which was served at the end was most delectable we had it at home the next day i cannot wait for the next occasion that justifies the expense for an evening at jaan\",\"beautiful view beautiful restaurant decor beautiful looking food and maybe romantic for a date which basically descibes jaan but that is about it been here twice for dinner lunch ordered the full chef is signatures menu each time dishes are decent use high quality ingredients taste light on the palate but nothing exciting nor interesting even though some of them had truffle truffle jus service is as expected for a fine dining establishment staff are friendly attentive however during my lunch they were supposed to serve petit fours they forgot to serve it until i asked for the price lunch is always a better value but i would recommend other better restaurants in singapore other than jaan for a good time with better tasting dishes definitely not  of the best restaurants in singapore despite being on asia is  best restaurants list\",\"jaan derived from the ancient sanskrit word for bowl is currently ranked th in asia is  best restaurants currently lead by chef de cuisine kirk westway jaan offers elevated modern french cuisine with imaginative twists and beautiful aesthetics i visited this establishment with miss m in september  as a celebration for both of our birthdays this restaurant had been on my to go list for a very long time having only  seats in the dining room it was quite a challenge to get a reservation in their restaurant during my previous visit to singapore i had tried calling them up to reserve a table one week in advance but it was fully booked so during my subsequent trip i have made sure to e mail them about one month in advance located on the th floor of equinox complex entering the restaurant is an experience by itself there is a booth at the ground floor that leads the way to an elevator up to the restaurant after passing through several short hallways we entered the restaurant and were lucky enough to be seated at a table with a spectacular view that oversees the marina bay sands the set up of the dining room felt really special with its bright classy interior at such a high elevation this was by far the most romantic restaurant i have ever been dining at jaan was one of the best fine dining experiences i have had so far at a very affordable price point of  i would say that their lunch degustation was more than worth it however be mindful that they have an additional charge for their amuse bouche which was automatically included in our lunch their stand out dishes were the heirloom tomato collection and their rosemary infused organic egg i cannot praise them enough for the creativity and artistry demonstrated in all of their dishes all of their plates looked so aesthetically pleasing to the eyes all these factors combined along with excellent service lead to a very enjoyable meal\",\"quite simply jaan is one of the best fine dining restaurants in singapore and another one of what i would expect to get the top michelin star marks writing about jaan on here is like doing so for andre almost every review written is much better than what i can ever write nik t birgit w and many others definitely do a great job putting an experience identical to my own into words it was a very surprising and highly impressive experience and i was there for valentine is day foodwise it was great and again i think others do a great job in putting the menu into words so instead i will write about my experience i was expecting a typical boring french restaurant that you would find in london nyc and other cities that are pretentious and uninspiring with your traditional pigeon foie gras sea bass etc but was pleasantly surprised from beginning to end where chef kirk hathaway did a hell of an amazing job putting together a menu of creative and tasteful delights yes he did use those boring ingredients i mentioned but in a very unique way with a new flavor than that i have ever had before the view also cannot be beat and you gotta do your best to get a table with the view only downsides the biggest is the wine list it is weak and lacks a lot of depth i hate the ipad wine list too and i hope these high end restaurants french laundry and per se included start getting rid of it one of the coolest and more impressive things about restaurants is if they bring out a brick of a wine list binder everyone always goes wow by it not a dirty ipad that god knows how many people touched also i am not sure if the french guy is the sommelier but he did not do much with suggestions or even offering to pour our expensive bottle of wine into a decanter it needed it i hope this was a valentine is day thing only since it was busy but there was no one there to pour the wine even after multiple requests it was on a separate table since there was no room on our table when our glasses were empty second is that i wish they only staff servers that know the food courses inside and out and are passionate about it there were a few courses where the server would come out and recite what was memorized and quickly leave which was pretty annoying for a place like that especially if i cannot understand their accent otherwise everything was perfect and made for one memorable valentine is day the staff really was very kind and made everything that we want happen for us the main server who was running around still was a total rockstar one of the greatest parts was that chef kirk actually came out and greeted us with one of the desserts we chatted for a good while about a number of topics it was awesome i hope other restaurants start adopting this personal touch highly recommend for that special someone or a great family dinner book at least a week in advance or maybe you will get lucky if booking later and on a weekday totally deserves the best\",\"to say kirk westaway is a storyteller is an understatement he spins fairytales his attention to details the subtlety and balance in his pretty dishes the overall ebb and flow ups and downs and then that happily ever after that ended on the perfect note needless to say i was won over dish after dish during my  hour long  course dinner julien may be the punchy one but you will never get sick of kirk and you would want more of his dishes the first serving of wagyu beef tartare with a clever fish chips done a la french fine dining a foie gras and truffle macaron salty creamy sweet and chewy and an olive cracker with olive pure and cheddar cheese superbly crumbly you know this briton has a sense of humor with this french rendition of english food then came the best onion brioche i have tasted those layers and that subtle onion flavor from the land we dived right into the ocean with the majestic irish oyster from donegal with artichoke cream and oscietra caviar loved the creamy plump and firm texture of the irish oyster which was balanced with the slightly nutty artichoke cream and then you have those pops of the sea as the caviar bursts then it was back to more refreshing bites with the tomato collection kirk took the humble tomato and cheese dish and elevated it to typical jaan standard the many flavors are coaxed from the vine ripened heirloom tomato first cooked sous vide in a tomato consomm to intensify its flavours then stuffed with a mixture of cubed oxheart tomatoes gherkins capers and oregano it was then restored to its original shape by the process of dehydrating and rehydrating the fruit the supporting basil sorbet green basil and mimolette cheese pesto japanese tomato berries olive soil burrata brought out the intense sweetness of the tomato by providing a refreshing song in the background this is the most sophisticated and complicated tomato i have eaten another gorgeous plate was the farmer is harvest with hand dived scottish scallop a dish that changes with the season a combination of sous vide and roasted blanched baked pickled pureed grilled root and leafy seasonal vegetables provided the different textures and that carrasco ham added a nutty salty balance for that meaty flavor there is just so many evolving layers on  plate of course the perfectly seared scallops contribute to the meatiness of this dish a short break later and bam kirk hits home with comfort and stability with the line caught john dory served with crayfish tail fava beans broad beans clams and pea puree the dish is finished with a pea velout poured tableside i felt stuffed but i could not help but finish every bit of this perfectly browned fish this is almost an asian dish i feel the roasted venison saddle was the most heavy handed dish of the lot but the meal peaks here a new zealand venison is served medium rare with celeriac ribbons that have been blanched in wholegrain mustard emulsion pear glazed in port sauce pear chutney and celeriac puree ah such lovely christmas flavors i thought it was a tad salty for me though dessert song with a lilt high again on the ivory caramel an out of this world chocolate dessert made with  michel cluizel white chocolate flourless chocolate sponge with tempered chocolate sheets are joined by french caramelised hazelnuts and sous vide aero chocolate\",\"what to say that has not been said before great service amazing food and nice venue if you get a table by the windows make sure to call early enough to get that we had the  course menu with the wine pairing if anything the wine pairing was the only thing that left me slightly disappointed too many whites as for best of singapore i still prefer andre it is more of an adventure but this is getting close\",\"where do i even start i am thinking of new superlatives to give this restaurant but i will ramble anyway first we start with the view an absolutely tremendous view of the skyline able to see the singapore flyer and the gardens by the bay it is as if you are dining in a spaceship overlooking pandora from avatar fame next the service attentive and worthy of accolades from the michelin guide once it comes to singapore and definitely comparable to the some of the best restaurants in new york las vegas los angeles etc and then the food oh the food some of my most memorable food experiences have come at marea lahaina grill morimoto and le bernadin the atmosphere the company the service and most importantly the food all come together to create the best possible experience put jaan right up there on the list all of the food was perfectly seasoned cooked extremely well and presented in a way that made you just sit and admire before polishing the plate clean a phenomenal experience\",\"the food the service the wine nothing could have been better pigeon meat was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing all chef is complimentary appetizers desert were heavenly i highly recommend this restaurant for a romantic night out a celebration or to experience a fabulous dinner whenever you travel to singapore restaurant manager frank philippe was courteous\",\"yeah i went here last year and tried the  course lunch this was it this became the meal that all future meals would need to live up to if this review is still up it means that i have not had any better dining experience since and i have tried  restaurants i would go back to singapore just to eat here the highlight of the meal was the egg on top of a bowl of rosemary smoke the view from the building the presentation of each course the price quite reasonable and how good it all tasted easily made this the best meal of my life\",\"jaan was the birthplace of chef andre chiang in singapore chef julien royer had big shoes to fill and i think he has done well jaan still combines great view with great food the price for the great view however is that it can be too glaring during lunch time so dont forget your sunglasses truth be told i actually came here thinking that the chef with altitude  event featuring david toutain of agape substance had started needless to say i was wrong it is from   nov the only saving grace was that they were featuring a new autumn menu phew be warned ml of chateldon sparkling water goes for  for more value ask for the free lemon slices a glass of  sancerre is    or  course menu is available for lunch at    respectively without wine pairing we went with the  course degustation lunch menu as the  course menu is a chef is surprise menu the amuse bouche was really lovely both visually and in terms of taste smoked eel with apple jelly crispy as can be chicken skin deep fried cheese balls and chef julien is interpretation of humus lentils aubergine and chestnut paste then came amuse bouche part deux mushroom tea poured into a portobello mushroom sabayon lovely complexity in texture and taste the in house bread selection wonderfully featured a choice of black truffle brioche mini baguette a sour dough and or a walnut raisin roll my recommendation is the divine black truffle brioche and the jaan staple walnut raisin roll after all that feasting  courses still remain first course bresse chicken confit oxtail and foie gras press black figs maple reduction toasted polanea terrine of chicken oxtail and foie gras rich and hearty balanced with the sweet figs and maple reduction visually tantalizing too second  rosemary smoked organic egg smoked rattes autumn mushrooms chorizo iberico buckwheatonsen eggs perfectly runny orangy yolk with soft whites slow cooked at around  degrees for mins chanterelle mushrooms and smoked rattes added earthiness and nutiness buckwheat pops texturised and chorizo iberico made it savoury lovely dry ice presentation to boot third crispy skinned atlantic mackerel pickled shallot squid sweet corn jus would olce forte as per menu description crispy skin it was fresh juicy mackerel without being overly oily finely sliced complimenting crispy baby squid finished with sweet corn mash and a sweet reduction my favourite of the lot fourth  hours kurobuta pork forgotten vegetables autumn brothby now your stomach might be stuffed but the pork belly was fork tender and melt in your mouth good the very sight of which can be a nightmare for the average healthy diner the forgotten vegetables of which i can only remember the parsnip helped cut through some of the greasiness the autumn broth which was ala tonkotsu ramen was slurped till the very last drop are we there yet nope it is pre dessert time a granny smith apple foam with basil granita and shiso leaves a very good palate cleanser fifth choconuts   sable breton tanariva chocolate tonka bean ice cream macadamia pecan nuts walnut snowchocolate mousse peanut butter more chocolate more nuts more chocolate more nuts more chocolate sweet rich and decadent done right nope post dessert time their petits fours consists of pineapple sorbet with crackling pops raspberry chocolate lollies mini madeleines nutty chocolates and pineapple jelly and finally the latte to finish was but anti climatic p s dbs posb card holders are entitled to a  discount\",\"exceptionally good a michelin rated french restaurant on the th floor of the swisshotel features a young chef who is very talented arguably the best food i have ever eaten go there and do a degustation\",\"i was taken to jaan for my birthday dinner after work back in june and it was one of the best meals i have had in awhile two person course meal with wine was around  including tax it is the best fine dining in singapore and the food was up to par compared with all the top restaurants in new york the restaurant is very private with only up to six tables in the whole restaurant it overlooks an amazing view facing the suntec building and you would be at awe being on the th floor of the swisshotel it was a perfect birthday dinner surprise dinner by my hubby they are known for their pigeon meat i tried for the first time and i am not sure what to think of it it is tender and tastes like chicken but it is pigeon my mind and palette were going at each other and my conclusion is that it was delish and at least i have tried it once in my life and not sure if i would try again i am an adventurous eater but eating a pigeon was a bit too much all other dishes were made to perfection and i loved each and every one of their  course meals hopefully i will return again soon\",\"waku ghin is a phenomenal meal the uni is obviously the stand out dish but on reflection every course is exquisite in its own fashion the seared amadai had a smokey crispness the wagyu was divine and deserts superb it ended up pp incl  glasses of wine each this is a crazy expensive meal and there are more affordable tasting menus elsewhere however if you love seafood you cannot miss this meal\",\"i was able to fortuitously find a seat in this temple of japanese inspired cuisine in singapore but you should book weeks in advance if you want a seat they only serve  customers at a time in small  people dining rooms in front of a grill and your own chef dinner is omakase only with a price tag of sgd plus tax and of course you may wish to pair it with wines a wine pairing where every dish comes with a recommended wine or sake costs additional sgd service is elegant but also extremely personal since i was dining alone my server made a point to strike conversation a couple of times gently and always respectfully i really appreciated the tone and the courtesy of all the servers the dinner starts with impressive raw seafood dishes among which i certainly was amazed by their signature dish a composition of sea urchin uni shrimp and caviar one of the most delicious dishes i ever had and i traveled extensively in japan tasting some of the best kaiseki ryori in the country other gems followed tagliolini with caviar and freshly grated truffle abalone gently grilled and then smoked in front of us with cherry blossoms a bouillabaisse of lobster delight after delight concluded by a delicious and delicate ochazuke each dish was expertly described along with suggestions to enjoy its flavor at the best after dinner each party is moved to their own table together with people from the other rooms in another common dining space overlooking the marina and the famous singapore skyline not to mention the light and fountain show here delicious desserts are served pre dessert main and petit four in a very customary sequence in summary this was a masterpiece dining experience flawless from start to finish in all its most minute details the price tag is serious but i am not regretting a single dollar at the end of this sumptuous dinner\",\"tldr bar service was great this review is for the bar service and not the  course meal my wife and i came in the evening on a weekday and were promptly greeted and seated our server was knowledgeable about all the dishes and amply explained things i ended up getting their pear fruit cocktail and a melon cocktail underneath their japanese fruit cocktail section which were both delectable we split the lobster spaghetti wagyu chim over rice and the fried chicken the wagyu was so wonderfully fatty you could feel you are gallbladder contract after eating it i was only here on vacation but next time i might plan ahead for the  course meal which looks incredible per my server it is usually a one or two weeks advance reservation but call in case there is openings the night of\",\"omg one of the best dining experiences i have ever had first to start just walking into this place feels vip and the cocktails are phenomenal the muscat cocktail was my favorite to start with and the japanese peach we were seated in the bar area first and when our private room was ready we went in it is pretty amazing that everyone gets a chefs table seat and you get to watch majority of the food prepared in front of you it is an omakase that consists of fresh seafood and some meat dietary requests can be accommodated as well but i myself do not have any so i just go with whatever the suggest chef tetsuya is mega famous and he is literally the god father of soooooo many world renowned talented chefs i honestly do not even know if he knows how many of his offspring are very successful chefs with multiple restaurants under their belts in highly populated cities i have been to many tetsuya offspring restaurants so although it was my first time eating at his restaurant and even though it was prepared by one of his chefs and not him the dishes were embraced by my palette i left this restaurant soooo happy even though we came to celebrate my hubby is bday i felt like it was mine every dish was beyond amazing i am a big fan of the abalone the prawn and the wagyu cooked to perfection as well as their signature dish the sea urchin baby shrimp caviar just stunning the seafood bouboulaise with bread was also excellent i hope to come back sometime in this lifetime\",\"kenscale   the best meal i had during my stay in singapore also happened to be the most expensive one i would not say that a more expensive meal would necessarily be the best but the one i had at waku ghin was just absolutely fantastic i would definitely say it is one of my all time best japanese meals of my lifetime located inside the famed marina bay sands hotel where i stayed just so i could check out the fabulous infinity pool and helmed by internationally acclaimed chef tetsuya wakuda waku ghin has long been one of the pillars of the great gastronomic scene at waku ghin you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve  course degustation menu priced at whopping s  per person thank god the dollar to singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get the chef will bring a gigantic plate of all the raw seafood that will be a part of your meal with that price tag each dish really had to be worth every penny which is a nearly impossible feat yet waku ghin pulled this out beautifully there were some really taste bites of seafood from japanese sawara mackerel that worked beautifully with eggplant and seaweed vinaigrette to slow cooked new zealand john dory with grilled eggplant to roasted new zealand scampi one of the signature dishes at the restaurant the marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served inside the sea urchin shell was pure nirvana and i could seriously eat this dish any given day the best dish in my mind however was the impeccable tasmanian abalone that came with fregola pasta and tomato it showed that the restaurant could also draw a page from western influence and i still cannot forget the beautifully cooked abalone that worked wonders with the pasta i was also deeply impressed with the braised canadian lobster that came with aromatic tarragon jus lobster was as perfectly cooked as it ever gets and the tarragon jus worked its magic to further add another dimension to the dish an assortment of fabulous seafood was followed by some meat dishes deboned spatchcock chicken was well cooked and worked harmoniously with black truffle my only compliant with wagyu roll was that there was too little of it but otherwise the meat is texture was absolutely juicy and tender following a serving of soothing somen and gyokuro green tea i was led to the main dining area where desserts started coming in tasmanian leatherwood honey ice cream with granite of lemon and gin jelly a light and refreshing dish was followed by ghin cheesecake ghin stands for silver in japanese another winning dessert that i wished i could have more of the restaurant has a classy and formal vibe but i still saw families with casual apparel enjoying their casual time together the services of the professionally dressed staffs were attentive and you can complement your meal with a variety of drinks from wine to sake to cocktails waku ghin will blow your mind if you are looking for a serious japanese fare with western touches i have always been impressed with the craftsmanship dedication and discipline that japanese chefs display and while the glitzy atmosphere of marina bay sands may make you think the meal at waku ghin is overpriced and overrated it is anything but okay maybe the price may force you to eat cheap food for the next month or so but if you are looking for a once in a lifetime meal waku ghin is pretty damn close\",\"never thought i would say this but i found a downside to spontaneity and that is cannot get reservations anywhere so i figured i will just eat at the bar it is a la carte at the bar there is both counter and tables at the bar ordered the steak it was okay the sauce was too sweet which really did not help bring out the flavor of the steak normally i love sweet sauce on anything so i do not know what they did wrong with this sauce just did not go perhaps the food is better not at the bar but after this steak i am not dying to come back\",\"i guess our expectations were different and we did not have the required refined tastes to enjoy the meal we were a party of  had the omakase ofc some v expensive sake and xs  of still water overall i was dissapointed maybe i did not enjoy the subtleness of the  well presented courses enough but honestly i was expecting to be wowed but in the end i came away with  reasons why i could have eaten elsewhere for  food but much much better value the uni was decent and the a wagyu was ok but everything else was sub par and honestly not worth the  do not forget gst service we paid per person however our chef from japan was a highlight in an otherwise mediocreally supposed ta be haute gastronomic experience like the new hublot ferrari engine watch or not o well at least they had phone charger for my poor android phone also was expecting like otoro or some other sashimi but o well i guess u cannot choose in omakase\",\"there is a reason why this place is ranked as one of the top  restaurants in the world a culinary experience not to be missed\",\"amazing food great service and superb wine pairing my favorite was the cold noodle at the end of the meal it was surprising refreshing\",\"my life is complete i ate off of the bar menu at waku ghin because the actual meal was definitely out of my price range even though the bill still came out to about  usd for  people this is likely one of the best food related choices i have ever made in my life from the drinks to the food everything was top notch just as i thought i had reached ecstasy the next bite always proved me wrong we ordered  dishes lobster open face sandwich sea urchin set on vinegared rice with caviar spaghettini with alaskan king crab tomato i have sat around for  minutes thinking about how to describe these dishes but i simply cannot find the words to justify how good they were the spaghettini is the most ordinary and replicable dish here the lobster sandwich and uni caviar were out of this world and completely indescribable we also had   drinks each i ordered various sake cocktails all of which required an amazing level of creativity to create i have never seen or had sake cocktails in america so this was refreshing and intriguing for me my girlfriend ordered  fresh fruit cocktails each of them were blended into a smoothie but were also unique in its own way the passion fruit cocktail was blended with real passion fruit so the freshness of the fruit and the seed were all infused into the drink the grapefruit cocktail had separate and distinct pulps that exploded in your mouth as you drink and popped them the bartenders here really outdid themselves i apologize for my inability to do justice in describing the food however i can confidently say that this was the best meal i have ever had which is incredible because the food was ordered off of its bar menu\",\"dear wakuda san i hope this letter finds you well my father won big by taking germany to win the world cup and so was able to dine in your restaurant last night coincidentally it was his birthday but alas he dined without me as he said you were too expensive for kids to tag along the first thing he said when i saw him this morning was son you need to study really hard and make sure that you can speak clearly and communicate properly i was perplexed but apparently the uncles and aunties who served him last night were not able to do so without him constantly having to ask them to repeat what they said again and again despite that service was still good but communications was a big f i guess your exquisite culinary creations have to speak for themselves the awkward teppanyaki counter setup further detracted from the dining experience as it proved more of an obstacle to service rather than a chance to showcase your gourmet menu frankly speaking there were no knives flying nor fancy schmancy cooking skills that warrants the teppanyaki counter is existence anything he had from the teppan could easily have been cooked in the kitchen the only good thing about it was he got to snap more shots for posting on yelp he also mentioned another uncle customer commented on how you no longer cook your abalone dish at the counter anymore so it is just the canadian lobster tasmanian cape grim beef and japanese ohmi wagyu beef that benefited from the under utilized obtrusive teppan you are probably better off without it but obviously he loved your food  stars for that alone he flew to sydney just to dine at your flagship restaurant and has been ever so effusive about your delicate cooking that incorporates the best produce and is always full of flavours just check out his gazillion photos when he gets round to uploading them all and you cannot help but click on like he said that it looks as good as it tastes or is it the other way around anyway just when he thought dinner was over you moved him into a much cosier environment for his just desserts the pre dessert kyoho grapes and granita was simple but amazing so sweet yet with a tinge of sour and the icy granita kept those seedless halves just firm enough before melting away in your mouth the dessert proper was a mango passion fruit cremet d anjou not properly explained and he had to refer to the menu they printed out for him it was quality but nothing mind blowing then he was surprised with what looks like your signature chocolate cake with perfectly scribbled chocolate birthday wishes thank you for saving me the trouble of having to buy him a birthday cake i mean the cake i buy can never come close to the velvety finish that he mentioned in passing finally your petit cinq completed a lovely evening of gastronomy even though he was so full he still popped every single one into his mouth instead of bringing some home for me uncle you kept him away for a good  hours but that was a good thing as it allowed the bottle of tsuki no katsura iwaimai nigori junmai daiginjo to vanish and for him to depart on a sake high thank you for making it an overall memorable evening for him yours sincerely nik juniorp s hopefully he does not have to wait till the next world cup to be back again\",\"waku ghin is a great restaurant with a plethora of flavors to keep your taste buds busy it will also make you feel as inflated as a blimp afterwards since it is just so much food also be sure to set aside   to  hours to dine here it is long took off a star because i was only wow would by one of the courses and drinks are below mediocre most of the dishes are good but not memorable i have been here on two separate occasions once i came alone after a friend was stuck at work and the second time with my girlfriend on one of our first dates you walk into the casino area of mbs and are pleasantly welcomed by the staff as they open the doors for you and and seat you to your room where you will sit alongside   other couples was a bit awkward when i came solo your chef comes into the room and introduces himself along with what he calls the menu or simply a showcase of the fish that will be prepared for the meal you say ok and move on with your culinary journey both of my experiences i had essentially the same dishes i believe it was the same season in two different years since the menu changes by season i had the following out of order unfortunately  shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served in a sea urchin shell their signature dish excellent as one would expect ocean trout with witlof and yuzu ok beef with arugula simple but meat was cooked nicely lobster in a garlic type sauce this was very nicely done king crab leg cooked and covered over a bed of salt and bamboo leaf this is the one dish that stood out for me easily my favorite and one i could rave about  live steamed abalone served with fregola pretty much your typical abalone dish but with a slight twist  japanese waygu beef slice with garlic chips and fresh wasabi nice consomme with rice and snapper good somen with myoga and junsai nice refreshing dish honey ice cream with gin and lemon jelly sweet yet easy to eat cheesecake unfortunately was just a cheesecake my girlfriend and i both had cocktails which to me were both pretty bad we even went to the bar after and had drinks there and they were mediocre at best for a bar that advertises itself throughout the hotel they really are not that good wish we stuck with sake after these experiences i really was not that wow would most of the flavors are those you can find if you have any of these fish at other restaurants except the king crab leg which blew my mind the setting and setup are all very cool but i definitely left hoping for much more that i did not get and i can only imagine that these guys will get better most of the dishes again are good but not great and memorable if michelin came to singapore these guys would for sure be in the mix for a potential  stars since they fit the criteria but they need to build more dishes with truly unique and memorable flavors otherwise i think it is worth a shot to try it out for the experience\",\"waku ghin constantly one of frontrunners for best restaurant in singapore a meal there will set you back a cool  per head not counting water or wine even then i am going to say it is worth going at least once each course is a myriad of flavours and textures all meant to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients in as dazzling a way as possible the signature dish of marinated botan ebi sea urchin and oscietra caviar is salty yet sweet clean tasting yet rich and amazingly it was not even my favourite dish personally i felt that it was just a little too ostentatious a little too opulent the charcoal grilled beef served with mustard was real delight the beef was full flavoured and the smoky flavour of the grill lingered in the most teasing of ways every time a dish came in a broth we ended up drinking from the bowl because apparently spoons were not always part of the dining experience but the amount of time and quality of ingredients that went into each of those nourishing liquids must have been significant because they were all packed with flavour dessert was a little lacklustre after the brilliance of the courses before it the simple coconut mousse with mango was almost insipid by comparison and a rather disappointing portion size at that one thing i must highlight however is that the service really impressed it was not as subtle or unobtrusive as i have experienced at other top class restaurants but they did manage one thing that sets them apart from any other dining experience i have had in singapore they noticed i was left handed and proceeded to place all the cutlery as a left hander would use it opposite of the normal place settings i have never had that ever happen in singapore overseas yes and that alone redeemed the seamless but average service we received for the rest of the evening\",\"located in the glitzy expanse of marina bay sands waku ghin definitely offers culinary decadence the experience is without a doubt very expensive but the  course degustation meal was hands down among my favorite of all time i am certain that i cannot describe the plates any better than the previous reviews have however i can confidently say that the food tastes as good as the descriptions and pictures project what stood out to me most though was the precision and attentiveness of the service if you want to be left alone to eat a meal in the corner this is not your place the staff here are incredibly well trained and go impressively above and beyond to be accommodating to their guests\",\"we love japanese food and we love waku ghin t ambiance is frendly but can be formal n stiff depends on t company ypu are with food is always good t few times   bin der it has been most satisfactory love it\",\"in the world of celebrity chefs tetsuya wakuda is up there with the best in the world many of us have had the privilege of dining at his sydney restaurant tetsuya is but how many of us have had the opportunity to dine at his singapore restaurant waku ghin well now i can add myself to those lucky people waku ghin translates to arise silver and pays homage to tetsuya is routes offering a  course japanese inspired degustation menu the restaurant is located in the iconic marina bay sands complex and offers a unique dining experience in fact waku ghin was just voted in the  s pellegrino top  restaurants of the world now that is an achievement the experience of waku ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff to the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge perfect for pre dinner drinks continue through the restaurant and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway with private teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least there is nothing ostentatious about the space warm timber compliments features of slick silver with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance alongside glimpses of the singapore skyline the restaurant seats only  people at a time offering  sittings each evening guests are seated in private teppanyaki rooms this evening mr j and i have our own personal teppanyaki chef dedicated to creating our  course degustation menu we share our teppanyaki room with another couple who also have their own personal chef the  course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us i should also note you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list if you cannot find something to tickle your fancy then you are not looking hard enough with our wine and food sorted we proceed to sit back relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at waku ghin our menu like oyster scallop with daikon and oyster leaf marinated botan shrimp with sea urchin and oscietra caviar grilled tailfish with japanese matsutake pan seared foie gras with kyoho australian abalone with fregola and tomato braised canadian lobster with tarragon charcoal grilled australian lamb with couscous japanese ohmi wagyu roll from shiga prefecture with wasabi and citrus soy scampi pasta gyokuro our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat i cannot help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive at least we know it is fresh our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish one at a time carefully explaining the dish as he goes along i love the personal interaction with the chef and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art as a plate of food each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated wow coming out of my mouth time and time again every one of those  courses achieves the same reaction once our degustation is complete we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert the room offers spectacular views of the singapore skyline our dessert menu cold soup of dates with tonka bean ice cream and orange pistachio ice cream with raspberry and chantilly coffee or tea and petit fours the desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening we are each presented with a personal menu dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening a lovely touch and memento though pricey dining at waku ghin is an amazing experience from the food to the decor to the service this is seamless top class dining this is an experience i am going to remember for a long time to come\",\"amazing food watching the preparation was great too overall a fantastic experience\",\"a place for high rollersat  per head before taxes waku ghin is a big commitment even before you start your dinner and yes they take your credit card upon reservation if you do not show up they deduct the price anyway the set up of the  seater restaurant is sparse and muted the main element is silver ghin which apparently is chef is favourite diners perch on uncomfortable bar stools for most of the  hour  course meal before moving to the lounge to be served a sliver of dessert service is not up to par as expected having told the receptionist that i was dining there on occasion of my birthday we were greeted with complete indifference not even an acknowledgement of the big day no matter the non existent service throughout the meal at least meant we were not bothered by inept staff the food is top notch comprising ingredients that are at the very top of their category and treated minimally at the teppan counter the private chef one to every  diners does a show and tell for his dishes before preparing it whether searing a piece of wagyu or cooking the abalone to the perfect texture some dishes are prepared in the kitchen such as the signature of botan shrimp and creamy hokkaido sea urchin the customised teppan plate is truly the star having your food cooked before your eyes does much to whet the appetite for normal folks waku ghin is a one time splurge but high rollers apparently dine there weekly so i guess the standard of the food will always be high just know what to expect it is not haute gastronomy the likes of restaurant andre or jaan and you will probably enjoy your  worth of prime ingredients done well\",\"this is hands down my favorite restaurant in singapore the ambiance and the food defines what good dining experience should be it is expensive and reservations are hard to come by but its worth it\",\"finally visited the famed manhattan bar walked in with no reservations and had two seats by bar which was where i would have wanted anyway amazing drinks collection including full cocktails that have been aged in casks by entrance amazing i had a hakushu distiller reserve sherry part of the house finished spirit it is smokey and has a reddish hue compared to a normal hakushu and very interesting he had loads of cocktails and all were really amazing harvey wallbanger jack rose new york etc their singapore nation a variation of the singapore sling is amazing sophisticated service was terrific great staff dressy waitresses bartenders were also very passionate about their drinks we were served by frank and he really made our night fun informative with drinks and good recommendations a lovely night out\",\"stars one of sg is most famous bars and often referred to as one of the best bars in asia this is a classy old new york feel cocktail bar in the regent hotel a wide variety of cocktail selection and everything tastes good though a bit on the stronger side great service\",\"the sort of place that a hipster from crazy rich asians would be a regular at the bar is classy and intimate the drinks are impeccable and the service is on point\",\"i have been to a lot of top tier bars in the world i have been to the majority of the top  bars in the world over the past  years without being aware then being aware at times i have been to bars that should have definitely been in the top  but are not i am stating all facts not bragging take it as you want to do not really care i like bars with class that is clearly evident the top  bars in the world are always mostly meh in my opinion but this place i can see why it is a winner i have only said this about the artesian years ago presentation service cocktails food atmosphere staff menus etc everything is on point it is sleek af except they were not doing their violet hour thumbs down i am out mic drop\",\"chic high end quality type of bar with a sexy vibe definitely dress up and not down at this establishment drinks are well over  a piece but the cocktails are too delicious to pass up they serve bar snacks with your cocktail which was a cute addition to our experience worth giving this place a try for a speakeasy type of feel\",\"very cool place inviting from the start you walk into a dark but cozy and high end bar plush seating down the center with slow tables on either side you really need to make a reservation if you want to be seated at one of the tables otherwise you will get a seat at the bar we were early and with no reservations could only sit at the bar the bartender attended to us right away providing us with menus a glass of water and a bowl of popcorn to snack on on the right had side as you walk in you can find their whiskey and bourbon barrels and on the left their spirits i had the  mile out plantation pineapple rum michter is us straight rye ferrand dry curaao lemon grenadine prohibition can only extend so far hardly an obstacle to ambitious entrepreneurs who sail wealthy patrons to international waters for a day of carousinghe had the mad men balvenie double wood  years st germain black walnut bitters perrier jout grand brut the hard drinking hard partying kings of madison avenue would approve of this masculine year elegant delight it was served with a very cool ice cube embossed with the manhattan logo both were delicious service was very good the bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable we were able to walk around and take some pictures everyone was friendly and accommodating highly recommend it for cocktails and a respite\",\"i think this is a wannabe bar not living up to its hype really dark inside but not really hiding anything i never sought out a cave for a drink surprised to find this cave in a nice hotel forced to go there as all restaurants closed at  pm music is really crap i liked some of it because i am pretty old young hip crowd would hate it too loud and no balance plus this cave is naturally very loud with screaming patrons piercing the ancient tunes with their drunken shrieks staff pleasant but slow to serve maybe lost in the dark food think sushi portions really tiny they said this was the  bar in asia at the reception this is not true asia has a million better bars\",\"i joined regent hotel so i wented here at night it was good music so many people server gave me more times popcorn it was goodfood was goodcoctail was good\",\"the drinks were nice but the playlist was straight from spotify weird overall nice place but overrated and pricey for not having a dj pay music\",\"i paid  for the adult is only brunch but it is worth it as i felt like i was transported out of singapore for an afternoon in a good way the service was really on point and the food was great the food offered had less variety compared to some other hotel brunches but i felt that there was more than sufficient in fact i met up with friends for dinner later that evening and could not manage to eat a bite the selection is limited to western food but honestly who eats an upscale version of hawker food when at a hotel buffet the seafood king crab legs yum was amazing and the cheese and charcuterie selection made me happy just by looking at it also do not i repeat do not skip the jalapeo cheddar biscuits as they are da bomb i could go on and on about the fantastic desserts the nice mains the great salad the foie gras but let is just keep it to the food is really delicious obviously the drinks do deserve a separate mention as they are one of the attractions they serve free flow cocktails plus beer and wine and have a good selection to suit every palate you can even ask them to customize your drink if there is an ingredient you do not like the diy bloody mary was pretty impressive a wide variety of alcohol bases plus a super cool condiment selection are offered and hallelujah they had ranch for my bloody mary to make things even better the service was pretty awesome we were greeted immediately by our friendly waiter he was happy to give recommendations and was very attentive we never had to ask to top up our water and our cocktails were refilled before they were empty heck he even asked if i was sure i wanted one drink when last rounds were called he offered to get me two this is the place where i want to celebrate my next birthday promotion engagement farewell to singapore some of these are more likely to happen than others you guess which or just when i deserve a treat recommended\",\"d and i were taken here by our friends for the adult is only cocktail buffet at regent hotel and it was the perfect place to chat away for a couple date or for large parties as well like the name the bar really takes me back to new york it mimics the library bar in ny and the atmosphere is hip and relaxed at the same time exactly what we were looking for on a lazy sunday afternoon it would be a perfect place to hang out at night though i only came here for the past three times during the day what prompted me for a review was this adults only buffet that was only made available around a year ago it is a bargain  pax when most a la carte cocktail drinks are sgd each try each cocktail listed in the menu in order around  of them and you will get more than your money is worth every single one was delish and by the last one we all had a good buzz on top of that it includes endless dishes of oysters foie gras crab legs steak and the best dessert selection i have had in awhile the buffet selection is not expansive but they present only the best ingredients so it was more than enough for us book early it is usually booked a month in advance they take your credit card to secure the spot and it is open only on sundays from   to  pm and as peter l mentions it is one of the top  bars in the world so it is def worth a visit it was funny to see what alcohol does to people most of the people were still in their seats by their pm closing time that the waiters had to kindly ask everyone to leave will return again for daytime fun with friends\",\"really cool bar with a really cool concept and space but there are a few mishaps as well ok so the fact that manhattan is one of the top  bars in the world was one of the reasons why i stopped by and for the cocktails the award may be well deserved the menu is very creative sectioned into various neighborhoods in nyc the focus is on well executed classics as well as some house specials loved the violet hour   where you get a free drink and sandwich i really enjoyed my classics like a red hook and a barrel aged presidente service is solid but the food is weak some of it was quite good like the sliders but the mac and cheese for  was micro bland and nasty and this is where manhattan will fall short compared to anti dote or even  hk i will definitely be back for drinks but it is better to fuel up on some food before coming here\",\"the cocktails in singapore the burbon collections matches any in the us the mescal cocktails are to die for\",\"this is such a sexy bar with delicious cocktails and amazing staff it is such a fun place to sip libations and have a conversation or have a date it is so beautiful and so well decorated make sure you walk throughout the space\",\"high class bar situated in the regents hotel the basic concept is an american bar added with lounge seats the drinks are on the top level you expect from such a place the menu is divided into sections standing for different cocktail areas starting with the colonization over the prohibition area ies ies umbrella loving ies until today for each decade there are specific drinks selected as well as food fitting to drinks and era in addition drinks with ingredients from the own rickhouse can also be found on the menu so your normal everyday drink will definitively taste different\",\"today friends and i made our first visit to manhattan bar to enjoy the sunday adults only cocktail brunch the regent has taken the sunday brunch concept and given it a deliciously refreshing twist from    pm we enjoyed cocktails served by an amazing staff and a limited buffet of delicious food served in a dimly lit elegant comfortable bar setting last but not least there is a no children policy all of this adds up to my new favorite sunday brunch spot the cocktail brunch menu choices leaned toward the sweet side wine and beer are also available and there is an upcharge for champagne it would be an improvement if they would double the number drinks on their brunch menu to a wider selection i drank mostly bloody marys and added my own toppings at a diy toppings bar in order for you to survive the  hour marathon the drinks are prepared a little weaker than normal that is understandable but it would be nice if they would ramp up the alcohol content as the afternoon progressed by  pm i was not tipsy enough and for a cocktail brunch that is a major failure the food buffet items were all delicious cheese board oysters lobster prawns scallops seared tuna numerous desserts salad and bagel bar additional items included in the price are ordered from the menu pan fried smoked foie gras braised short ribs and a blt salad were especially exquisite the staff was attentive gracious and amazing keeping the drinks and food flowing without delay this is some of the best service i have seen in singapore and they were a big part of what made the experience so enjoyable the good the overall concept the elegant bar setting the staff the food the no children policy the bad weaker than normal sweet selection of signature cocktails i believe the simple fix here is to request options not on the brunch menu and ask that they make them stronger the verdict the up for the cocktail buffet is  but we each received  off for today is facebook promotion if you enjoy a boozy sunday brunch give manhattan bar a visit\",\"i was taken here on a sunday afternoon for their adults only brunch buffet which features a bagel station seafood maine lobster oysters crab station big big range of desserts a small menu of hot food to be ordered a bloody mary station cheese station um i also drank a lot because drinks were free flow what is there not to love seafood was fresh bagels were made by a nice guy who brings it to your table the foie gras hot item was very much loved and all washed down with booze you stumble home in a cab and enjoy the rest of your sunday after this brunch service was also impeccable p s the prices are shocking\",\"if you are looking for some impressive bar grub to go along with those cocktails this is the place for you from lobster rolls to ahi tuna fried dumplings you are all set to ditch the post drinks supper run dive for the fried bread butter pickles which sets the perfect thrill to the numbing cocktails drinks wise fancy concoctions but nothing to shout about they are known for their aged barrel offerings which are essentially pre mixed concoctions stored in an aged barrel but this pretty much means you do not get to give it that bespoke twist which is all the rage these days\",\"i stayed at the regent for a couple of months forwork must be new people working the door i waslooked up and down and quickly brushed off seem like the atmosphere of the regent is not as friendly as before went right to the st regis and the astor bar was warm and friendly and much nicer attitude\",\"edited after sobering up ricky paiva has brought with him the best bar in singapore bar none if you are experienced and know your drink just have a look at the bar this bar costs a mint in both its interior decor the bottles of exclusive and extremely hard to get liquor all the way up to how the bar is presented to the crowd there is meant to be a rickhouse in the premises but i did not have the opportunity to develop the conversation for me to sneak a peek at it last night there is no live entertainment here but ricky is taste in caberet style music background suits the scene perfectly manhattan is so out of place for a regent chain hotel because i would have expected the more up market parent four seasons to host this or one of the  to  star hotel chains to ask ricky to join them in their a team but what results is just fantastic as cheryl n ms skinny fat indicated this bar is very stylish i would not go so far as her to say its nineteenth century but hell she was probably having such a good time it did not matter if she interpreted it as th century or not the contemporary setting seems to exude its own classic presence made up of marble oak and leather and what results is just classy even exceeding raffles hotel standards in my books the point of it is that you can have a complete blast here i do not have much experiences with rickhouses but i do drink single malt is and am able to appreciate fine liquor and wines and hold my drink reasonably well with that said let me walk you through what we had food rebellion burger and street styled hot dogs let me just say that i thought this is the best mini burger i have had the meat patty almost melts in your mouth it beats bacchanalia is burger and makes most other burgers from any other hotel or reputable restaurant brands look lame the hot dog is definitely the best hot dog in singapore we also ordered the shrimp ceviche taco which was quite good but after the burger and the hot dog we recommend you have this first as a starter because once you get into the burger and the hot dog there is no going back the green pepper maize n blaze is quite good also but again do this first drink we started with the recommended new york sour a mix of bourbon port maple syrup lemon bitters and egg white and the  club made up of gin lemon mint and seltzer water i think people who like mohita type drinks will appreciate the  club and it is definitely a drink for those who do not really drink to kick off the evening the new york sour is interesting and do require you to have a broader and more refined taste in your mixed drinks department to appreciate nevertheless we enjoyed both immensely the alcohol content and levels was not getting to us so we moved onto the eighth ward think its made up of bourbon whiskey vermouth dry curacao and remember the mame bourbon whiskey and do not ask i was enjoying it too much these drinks will knock your socks off as the whiskey leaps out at you and the supplementary ingredients just brings out the drink is own personality in its own very unique way if you are a single malt whiskey drinker these drinks might actually taste more gimmicky but ricky has managed to add a level of sophistication and variety into these mixes that i feel they are just wow its like having one of those boutique beers for the first time expanding your appreciation of beers in a different direction and in a very unique way what ricky has managed to achieve just puts the icing on the cake in terms of a whiskey concoction you simply cannot experience anything like this in singapore until now we were not fortunate enough to try their negroni as they had run out and were waiting for the existing stock to take in the oak if you want to experience the best the bar has to offer strike up a conversation with ricky or one of his senior mixologists yes that is what they do in real bars and pubs we did both and we were not disappointed at the least\",\"not amazing of course but a very solid choice if you are looking for some quality beers and an american style burger and find yourself in the district loved the beer flights they had a large number of beers brewed in house available which were excellent i enjoyed the lighter stuff and the porter there was more in the ipa range which is not my thing do not forget the growlers though good supply of stuff to go\",\"long time customer but i am done food is not very good anymore prices seem to go up every time i come here too bad because this was a great spot\",\"sucks used to be my go to place now service is terrible cannot sit at the bar cause the fans blow all the taste off your food staff is not helpful spicy hawaiian pizza is gone now gotta pay for jalapenos new design is terrible\",\"from the looks of the reviews it should be a good place first off the beers are not much in terms of craft watered down in my opinion and mostly flavorless the staff was slow sloooooooooow the food oh boy i was up all night due to a stomach ache after eating here i had the all bacon burger i could only stomach a few bites and  hours later i am still sick to my stomach while the vibe in this area is cool i would avoid it hate to give bad reviews and probably would not if i was not still sick\",\"the beer is ok and most of the food is fried the beer was alright it is an average restaurant but a great place to hang out with friends and toss back a few cold ones\",\"came here as a last stop before we left the country excited to try out local craft beer we were left quite disappointed the beer tasted watered down and not much flavor in any of the beers we tried the location was great and the view was nice the service was fantastic but the price was quite high compared to the rest of the country however for the area it was comprable\",\"brewerkz finally a brewery i have been all over looking and finally we found one right on the river dope the beer selections are delicious try the red and the honey bee the red might have been my favorite a flight is  i am upset we did not try any food besides the chicken sticks because those were delicious cannot imagine anything else being anything but delicious they served them with a peanut dipping sauce that was everything to me they have a gift shop area where i got a hat for  and a bottle opener for  perfect place for me i felt right at home\",\"this place is right by the water a nice view and good people watching we just had a beer here the food looked pretty western the beers here were also expensive s  i had a blackberry wheat ale it was good and had a nice fruit flavor good for a stop but expensive\",\"i really respect what this business is trying to do bring craft beer to singapore which is something of a desert when it comes to finding good beer however the beer here is absolutely heinous their wheat beer tastes like a lager or a pilsner their black raspberry ale tastes like stomach acid i know i know i should have avoided the exotic fruit beer lesson learned the only good things about brewerkz are the happy hour prices before pm the nice view from the riverfront location and the relatively friendly and helpful staff i pray that the proprietors spend more time improving the flavor of the beer but until then it will just be another unmemorable riverfront beerhall catering to clueless ang mo tourists\",\"the beer is flat out amazing especially the raspberry sour beer we love their burgers and food great for an authentic american meal the service is top notch\",\"came here after getting pissed off at da luca see my previous review and wow the place was wonderful upon arrival staff were super polite and friendly immediately directed us to a table although  seconds earlier they had said wait  minutes we did not know what to eat so we asked for recommendations and boy were they quick to advertise some of the cheaper yet nicer foods on the list we had succulent beef steak a meat plate and nachos yummy the nachos were perfect and along with the guacamole the sides and the cheese it was perfectly heaven all i can say the beef was juicier than expected and boy was it yummy the tender beef sliced easily and we savored every single mouthful craving for more every time until we ran out of beef on our plate the meat platter consisted of chicken leg and pork i did not try the pork as i did not feel it but i tried the chicken the skin is very very spicy and wonderful was the meat it was like eating a kfc but like  chickens in one bite we also had the golden ale which was very good and enjoyable and will definitely be enjoyed by everyone overall just go stop reading this get out of the house and go now\",\"awesome beer many selections the view is nice and the service was great would recommend if you like beer in a relaxed atmosphere\",\"i cannot believe i have not reviewed this place before i have been here since it first opened a couple decades ago was but a wee lad not even legal but still stealing sips off my parents sample flights over the years on my craft beer journey i have both loved and loathed this place but i reckon i love this place more than loathe it but first the sore points unless you are here for a lunchtime pint this place gets packed make reservations crowd is varied from knowledgeable locals to expats definitely a must visit if you have only got a few days and are hankering for a good beer this is one of the first few micro breweries in singapore and is pretty much the defining local micro beers tend towards the maltier more drinkable end of the spectrum and are great for novices looking to get their feet and palates wet without having to plump for more expensive bottles beers are relatively reasonably priced too which is a huge bonus here alcohol is generally quite pricey thanks to various taxes the golden ale is a nice one to start with eminently drinkable and lovable seasonal brews populate the draught list but my old standbys are the oatmeal stout and hopback ale there is also an ok list of bottled imports well worth exploring if you are looking for something beyond the house brews on to food the menu has seen several makeovers over the years but quality can be inconsistent nonetheless it is fairly decent bar grub tending towards the american side of things think burgers and thin crust pizza still good for satisfying a beer induced hunger just do not expect michelin starred cuisine service is equally spotty and the good servers do not stay that long still staff are knowledgeable ish about the beer and the food which is far more than i can say about many other f b establishments in singapore all in though brewerkz has been a constant presence in the local f b scene as well as being a pioneer in the local craft beer movement it is one of my favourite haunts and i hope it becomes one of yours\",\"nice outdoor seating area by the water with a decent selection of beers ciders and cocktails\",\"i stumbled upon brewerkz while looking to get a drink why we waited to eat dinner at jumbo seafood and to my surprised it was a brewery which i wish was code that way on yelp thought we were just hitting a bar i love trying local craft beer and particular i am a fan of samplers which brewekz offers which was awesome it is such a great way to try a bunch of beer to find one you actually want to invest in drinking and since drinks in general are pricey i found in singapore nothing would be worse than being stuck with something you do not like that you paid a lot for the beers i tired were on the hoppier side not typically my style but i can appreciate them and way better than a tiger for sure the brew pub is along clarke quay with a nice waterfront view\",\"well i just had to find a local microbrewery in singapore and success haha it only took me three days besides that this place is in a really cool area called riverpoint so it is right on the water and has really sweet outdoor seating we sat inside though so we did not melt and it was glorious ac on blast first of all the place had somewhat of an unique american micro pub feel with all of the art and decor then the burgers subs and pizza options on the menu brought it all together it was really nice to get that at home feel in singapore for a little it was a sunday afternoon so i had a chance to try a few of the beers all microbrews that were brewed on site first was the wheat   wheat is my favorite kinda beer and i can be a little critical with these it seemed like they tried too hard with this one and the attempt to infuse some hops in left me a little confused then i had the golden ale   this was by far the winner crisp aromatic and medium bodied with refreshing aftertaste they nailed it with this one and you should definitely give it a try finally the irish red ale   the color and consistency was a little off but the aroma and taste were spectacular very refreshing overall in hindsight i wish i did the flight sampler but they do offer smaller ml options so that you are not hammered if you want to go in on  beers over the course of your meal the best time to go  pm after pm the prices start shooting up trust me oh yeah the cowboy burger was cooked spot on with the way i asked and very very flavorful i was delightfully surprised brioche bun two thumbs up enjoy ian m\",\"brewerkz great beer selection if you are a beer person this is a valid place to visit i believe some if not all were locally made food is average vegetarian options are available i had the margherita pizza good crust and appropriate cheese sauce ratio location is perfect right next to the river short walk from robertson quay and clarke quay so you can continue your drinking at clubs or bars nearby great for smokers hah music could not hear because of the ambient noise so not great i would say the price overall is more affordable than most other bars oh also they have a billiard pool table not sure which one you can tell i am no expert it is two dollars per game i would recommend if you are looking to entertain colleagues in a less formal setting enjoyed the experience overall would be nice if they fixed the music though\",\"why i have not reviewed this place even after visiting multiple times is something i do not quite know so time to make amends located conveniently at a ten minute walk from the clark quay mrt and right on the water this place gets seriously packed once pm rolls around so if you have to wait more than  minutes for a table that should not come as a surprise although if you are not hung up on tables there is always place at the bar this place has been featured in many f b blogs and is touted as the ringleader for bringing the microbrewery culture to singapore and i am not surprised that is one of the accolades they have all of their in house brews are very very good right from ipa is to the stouts to the honey apricot mead all very very good if you are looking for other non house brews you will find those too along with a list of mixed drinks and mocjtails and the non alcoholic beverages all in all a bar well stocked coming to the food there is really no way you can go wrong with ordering anything off the menu since its all pretty standard american fare from chips drenched in cheese sauce and chilli to their monster creation the king brew burger only thing i would suggest is order as needed portion sizes are pretty big and you may find yourself staring at the other half of your burger or thin crust pizza torn between gluttony and being a civil person and not eating it all the dessert menu seems good toughie never quite had a chance to try it all in all a good place to visit for a very relaxed atmosphere on the water   will recommend   will revisit\",\"after many a meal at hawker centres my friend and i decided that some wings were what we were missing in our lives after all one can never have too many wings unless you are a bird then that might be problematic anyway solid wings decent ipa this is singapore so you expect to pay more than you would in the us i am glad i came here once but probably not again if i am in the country\",\"great spot i had a burger that was very good and the beer there was great definitely try the mussels to start too\",\"i am still wishing i can eat this bean curd now sigh so silky and smooth lightly sweetened to perfection if you like bean curd this is amazing they come in original and almond flavor both mouthwatering texture is perfect it is all premade and you can get extra to go found in the first row when you walk in to the maxwell hawker center\",\"i tried their almond and regular flavored bean curb they were pre sweetened and a bit to bland for my taste they were okay but not great the price for the regular flavor in nov  was sg  and sg   for almond flavor it is a good value but hold your expectations down a bit\",\"honestly the best soy milk and tofu pudding dou fa that i ever had i wish a place like this existed in toronto when i was in singapore we made it a priority to come here the first attempt when we went the shop was closed the second time it was open and we bought soy milk and tofu pudding and after trying it we instantly bought more because it just so good\",\"i was very surprised with this tiny sweet treat it was soft textured like tofu but lightly sweet and healthy treat it was good on its own but i can also see myself adding a few more sweet milks fruits and such there were also other stalls that sells this as a drink form with boba or grass jelly\",\"i heard about this place from a yelper allene t that i follow i only got the original beancurd for   sgd the beancurd tofu dessert does not come with syrup on the side since it was already sweetened the beancurd was silky smooth and delicious i never had anything like this before definitely give this place a try when you are at maxwell food centre\",\"tried this at the old airport food centre location original flavor   was wonderful the beancurd was firm but not too firm perfectly sweet but not too sweet yum there was a happy beancurd stall two stalls away which was selling the same thing for   buy one get one free being a cheapskate i challenged my wife that she could not taste the difference and we should buy the one that was half the price we did a blind taste test and she could tell the difference immediately\",\"i  agree with the rest of the reviewers i visited maxwell food centre as a tourist and had lao ban for the second day in a row that is how good this stuff is i am not sure if there is an original store but the two that i tried old airport taste exactly the same and are equally amazing in taste see lao ban old airport review here yelp com biz lao ban soy i went ahead and got the regular flavor preferred over almond and had it during the middle of my meal who needs to wait to eat dessert price is   sgd and there was no line whatsoever on a weekday evening\",\"life changingly good growing up eating this stuff for dessert i was alway mehhhhh about tofu for dessert but man i have changed my mind after trying lao ban is dessert to be honest we were eating tian tian chicken and sat down right in front of lao ban is stall having a couple coins from change received from tian tian is and seeing some folks buy bags and bags of tofu i decided to give it a try first bite amazing the tofu is so soft and smooth and not overly sweet a purchase of one turned into a purchase of many i brought the extras back to the hotel and ate them the rest of my stay in singapore i am glad i went out on a limb and gave this place a try\",\"i still remember the first time i actually had lao ban tau huay a friend bought it for me and i was really skeptical about how good it would taste there is so much rave and craze over this cold dessert and it got me thinking what is sooooo magical about it and indeed when i first tasted it i had that magical moment lao ban beancurd unlike the usual traditional ones is served cold and has a pudding like texture i know there is this lao ban style beancurd recipe that is being spread online but it does not seem like anyone has achieved the golden balance as yet it is definitely not easy to achieve the pudding texture and then when you start eating it all the soya milk start oozing out okay i am not too good at describing it but you get the point the bottom line is it is delicious after trying it i finally understand why the queue is so long there are two flavors that you can choose from original and almond usually i will just go for the original even my overseas friends enjoyed this a lot when they came over here however i do feel that they can make a little improvement by introducing a not so sweet recipe as the regular ones taste a tad too sweet to some\",\"this is the most amazing thing i ever ate i would literally go back to singapore just to eat this again i got the original flavor and the taste and texture was so perfect\",\"the best  i have ever had very smooth light not too sweet fresh tasting at   it is a steal jonasapproved\",\"meh enough with the formalities prim and proper attitude and masked phrases i am just going to be a straight out bugger for this review you are not singaporean if you have never done your time in national service if you are a guy that is ladies exempt or if you have not had a fix from lao ban soya beancurd choose any stall this one just happens to be my poison of choice of course if you are allergic to soy i would let it slide but hey pop a zyrtec and i am sure you can have one small bowl at least it is worth it come on i do that when i am about to have shrimp knowing hives are a comin so yeah if i have to tell you one soy product that is actually worth eating despite the endless genetic mutations this particular crop has gone through nowadays i would swear by this little bowl of silky smooth awesomeness not to mention it was one of few places i had to have a mini binge before my way out of good ol is g if you are wondering the tally was  bowls if you have lived in singapore for some time now and have not had this yet i will i will i will call the cops on you yelp    my last  weeks in sg\",\"this tofu tastes like heaven it is so smooth and silky i have never tasted anything like this so simple yet so delicious wish they have this at the states\",\"this is probably the best beancurd you can get in singapore good thing is that they started expanding with several outlets in various districts\",\"look it is a bird it is a plane no it is a giant inexplicable queue ok so this is not that unusual in singapore neither is a stall that basically serves a single item nor a queue that begins before the stall even opens the  is still excellent though it was not quite what i expected having seen an entirely different concoction while living in taiwan with the same name but it would not be a stretch to say it redeemed mostly plain tofu sweet without being sickly so a snack that one can consume without guilt unless one starts building a pile of empty plastic containers of course between here and tian tian one can end up waiting for a long time at maxwell food centre but if one is singapore i figure it is just part of the cultural experience to participate in one of the national sports queuing is a singaporean national sport right\",\"a must try a local favorite hot spot for this soft tofu dessert located in hawker locations of singapore made with very soft tofu served in hot cold with sweet ginger water so when you are in the singapore area be sure to make a trip to taste this refreshing dessert\",\"located along old airport road this humble stall in old airport food center has been serving tow huay to the neighbourhood for ages it has been well known for their silky smooth tow huay it has two stalls in the food center and you might be lucky to find one of them with no one queuing however if you visit them during peak hours be prepared to see a long queue they should not be hard to spot they serve different flavours almond and original are the most popular flavour there was this weird occasion where someone who queue  minutes and ordered only one tub of tow huay and the owner assistant was quite surprise though there is no minimum order you would find people ordering many tubs at one shot as mentioned the tow huay is refreshing and melts in your mouth you would want to have another as one tub is just not enough\",\"as a person addicted to sugar highs i usually take my tao huey with sugar syrup so when i first heard about lao ban and how they do not serve the beancurd with any syrup at all i was seriously sceptical about it but one day after watching the corporate drones at raffles cbd buy them by the tens i decided to give them a try the texture of this beancurd is similar to gelatin jelly instead of normal beancurd instead of splitting into smaller pieces it melts away into a beancurd liquid in your mouth really interesting to the point where we all got addicted to this new variety and no longer prefer the old beancurd the store i patronise only offers takeaway
